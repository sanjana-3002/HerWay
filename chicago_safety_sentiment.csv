How (un)safe is Pink + blue line to O’Hare 11pm-2am with big bags?,"So I’ll  to go to O’Hare from California pink line then take the blue line at the loop. I have two bags and will go alone.
For what I’ve read the best is stick to the first car and that it won’t be pleasant anyways.

Is it really “unsafe”? Like what I’ve really find on the posts is like “better Uber” “better if you are not alone” “better the first car” “better not do it” “I wouldn’t risk it” but like I haven’t heard a real reason more than anxiety or fear, does something bad actually happens at this hours on the trains?

Also what you think is the best/safest(?) hour to do the ride between 11pm to 2am? I planned first arriving early leaving at 11pm but on one post I saw people felt a little better early morning than late night, so now I’m considering too, what you think?




——————————— My experience with pink line at midnight and blue line at midnight ———————————

Update of my experience doing this. 
Sorry it became a story time so conclusion: At the end I never felt unsafe and it wasn’t bad for me, but remember there’s always risk and if you have ride alternatives it’s always better to pay a little extra for your safety.

——
I post this here because on my search of pink line at midnight and blue line at midnight there weren’t really many experiences or at least not recent and I’m just gonna put mine here in hope someone else can check it out and see ONE person experience doing this around midnight. (Again this was just MY experience and it doesn’t mean it’s gonna be the same for you, I would hope this was easy and safe for everyone, but there’s still many doubts and people feel unsafe)

So here goes my experience at midnight from California pink line going to Clark and lake and then the blue line to O’Hare on a Sunday.

First what you need to check is what’s your best option, if you have the chance of using Uber/lift or whatever, I wouldn’t doubt about it if I could really afford it (maybe some folks think that if you can travel you have an extra $70 for a ride, but it’s not at all everyone’s option)

Then if you decide to go for public transportation then check options of buses and trains maybe it’s not great traveling on this with luggage but it won’t be for that long and if you think you can deal with that then you go and check the actual times that certain bus/train is working at that certain day, so in my case the last pink train was at 1am and the first at 5am(wouldn’t have worked for me to wait that long)
Then you decide what time to actually leave, I really think, and maybe it’s not a generalized thought, that always better the first train in the morning I.e.5am because there’s might be more people taking it for early shifts or something, or the earliest you can at night so maybe not wait until 1am and this is not just about security but also I’ve read that sometimes the trains at night just don’t arrive and people wait for hours or just go get an Uber because there’s no other option.

You will have to be rested cause you will have to wait long cold hours at the airport on the floor while taking care of your luggage, or just be a warrior and go through the pain with no sleeping, crying and praying. lol

Now how it actually went for me:
I decided to start with this the earliest I could that end up being 11:10pm. I had to walk with my 1 very big luggage, 1 carry on and 1 personal item all over the weight or dimensions limit. It was dark but I didn’t cross paths with any other human being until I was at the pink line station door at 11:20, tbh this 10 minutes where the ones I was actually the most afraid but nothing happened.

Then I had to wait like 10 minutes by myself, on the platform, again there was no one and I didn’t feel unsafe at any moment I actually expected there to be a drunk guy sleeping or something, but nothing.
I got to the first car of the L around 11:30 there where another 6 people with me minding their own business and once again no drunk or drugged guy, no crazy people either.
(AGAIN!!! This was MY experience I really think in most cases at any hour there will be someone making people uncomfortable or at least sleeping idk)
I arrived to Clark and lake before 11:50pm
And the worst part of all this journey was having to get my bag from that platform to the blue line. 
I have to say on the station there were like 2 or 3 guys sleeping but there was more people and even some police officers, so I really felt safe I think I just got lucky… more than usual.

Again it was horrible getting bags down even though there were this smelly slow elevator (you actually have to take 2 of this but hey, there’s at least the option!)
BUT it almost make me lose the blue line train. As soon as the door of the elevator opened, the train audio of doors closing was playing and I rushed to the nearest car of the train, which was the last, so I was getting ready for it to be a really bad experience. But there when I entered at least half of the seats were taken and actually just one homeless guy sleeping there and everyone else minding their own business with their headphones or on their phones, so again I felt safer knowing I wasn’t there alone with this big bags. During the way to the airport pay of the people left and just 3 of us make it to O’hare (including the sleeping guy) I arrived there were cleaners and some other people leaving from other cars and then that was it. (I counted people sleeping on the train cause I had to walk and there were just like 7 on the whole train)


Look, once again it was my experience and I think I was lucky I didn’t go through anything weird or crazy people, I honestly wasn’t really afraid of getting killed or mugged cause as I said when I placed the question I really don’t think it is that frequent that something like that happens, I know it does exceptional times but it’s not the rule. The time I’ve spent in Chicago I’ve seen crazy things/people on the trains at mostly every hour, and honestly think that there won’t ever be something like 100% guaranteed safety travel, but I also think this is the common rule for almost everywhere around the world, so yes the safest option will always be Uber or similars and if you have that option it’s always better not to risk it, but if you really have to go and do this midnight rides then chances are you gonna be okay, but there will always be the risk, also sadly from past experiences I’ve seen and I think women are more targeted, so it’s always better if you have someone to do this with and not by yourself, I honestly think this will give you a little extra layer of safety. Just always be aware of your surroundings, don’t hesitate to ask for help if it comes to it and if you have the chance to a safer ride always take it. If there’s no other option chances are you’ll be okay, but it’s never 100% guaranteed.

Why do people say the city is more dangerous than it is?,"Before I start, I'm not trying to be confrontational or dismissive. I'm genuinely confused at how people seem to overstate crime in many parts of the city. I feel like I'm missing perspective. Maybe a bit lucky. If any of this contradicts your experiences, I'm all ears.

I am not from Chicago originally, but I have lived here for over a year now. Multiple neighborhoods up and down the city. More specifically: Pilsen, Roseland, Rogers Park, Albany Park, Logan Square\*, and Belmont-Cragin, in that order. I also have worked around Norwood Park, Clearing, and Ukrainian Village. Suffice to say, I have a good feeling for what at least 90% of the city is like. Not one time did I walk the street fearing for my life. I never witnessed anything scarier than a drug deal or a loud argument (between people who already knew each other). The only time I heard gunshots was during the 4th of July when people were using them instead of fireworks. In fact, a lot of the time I walked at night, it was just me. By the way people online and offline talk, you'll think there's always a monster around the corner.

I'm not saying there isn't poverty in the city or crime is completely absent. I spent most of the last year effectively homeless and was victimized by a few white-collar scams\*\*. I also am aware of many parts of the city being working class or outright poor. The thing is, ""Chicago is scary"" isn't something exclusive to online suburbanites. The only difference is Chicagoans will get more granular and specify different neighborhoods.  Okay, fine so far, but who in the right mind is fearing Uptown? Where are the shootings going on in McKinley Park? Did anybody get mugged in Hermosa? I'm being completely serious here. Even the Loop seems to be portrayed as scary after dark. That last one in particular I can say is bullshit and a relic of how cities were in the 70s-80s.  
  
I personally have had to deal with violent, scary people, but only *once* it was somebody I didn't already know. It's of course my own personal experience, as I said I'm not here to dismiss anyone. It's just that I feel like the city has more to offer than right downtown, Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Wicker Park, and the ""civic worker suburb"" neighborhoods. The places where the claims of danger seem to be consistently backed up are some of the inner South Side (Fulton Park, Washington Park, Grand Crossing, Englewood) and West Garfield Park, plus a few small areas near them.

Am I the only one who feels like this? I hope I'm not just missing something.

What's really going on in the South Loop?,"TLDR; Opinions on Sentral, The Cooper or 1000 South Clark? Also, more importantly, what's really going on at Roosevelt Station/nearby area? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. In case it isn't clear, I don't think anything of Chicago besides it's lovely and like any other major city. I just wanted to get a better understanding of what I've read on Reddit and was trying to offset the ridiculous nature of this post with humor!

UPDATE 2.0: **Final update, I promise.** I just wanted to say thanks again–y’all are really kind and reading your experiences has been very helpful. *Thanks for being my grain*s *of salt!* **If any of y’all in the South Loop (or nearby) want some new friends, DM me if you're interested in meeting up. My partner and I don't know anyone in Chicago and are starting from scratch.** Thanks again everyone!

**Background**: My partner and I are moving to Chicago (for work). With that being said, we're pretty stoked about it because we both fell in love with it when we visited a few years ago. We have lived primarily in the NE, specifically NYC (both Manhattan and the Bronx).

**Why the South Loop:** We've looked at a few areas, and we both seem pretty happy with Printer's Row/South Loop. We've read several threads, and we understand it can be a *sleepy* area, and that's fine with us. We have no issue traveling to other areas if we want to go out. We're pretty set with a few solid coffee shops and small businesses. Another reason we're set on it is the proximity to the park and the lake. Being close to green spaces is important to us, and we wanted to be within a quick walking distance.

Cool. Hopefully that answers anyone who might be asking *why* we're looking at this area. **We've found a couple of buildings that have interested us (Sentral, The Cooper, 1000 South Clark), so if you have any personal experiences, please share.**

Otherwise, my main question is this: **I've read that a lot of people love the South Loop, but it seems like even when people have nothing but good things to say... they all still mention Roosevelt station.** Now, we've ridden the NYC subway day and night, we've lived in some sketchy neighborhoods when we were broke college kids, and all of that was... fine. *Sus*, but, ultimately, fine. So, is everyone being dramatic? Have y'all never lived in another major city? Should we be looking elsewhere? Is it just the station–i.e. is it self-contained?–or is it the entire area? I don't even think we'll be taking the train often since we like walking when possible, but clue me in *please (am I going to get murdered? jk)*

I don't want to live somewhere where I'm constantly being harassed or where I'm scared to have my girlfriends/family visit. They're all already up in the air about Chicago being dangerous, and I hate being told ""I told you so."" My partner and I agree that any major city can be dangerous (uh, cue NYC), but are we walking ourselves into some kind of miserable (ahem, dangerous) trap? I seriously cannot get a clear read from everything I've read.

PS. Yes, we're going to visit in person, but visiting is very different than living. So, if you have lived experience, that's what we're hoping to read/understand.

Elderly low-income South Shore apt.: dangerous?,"Sorry for this 3 a.m. rambling post...

I saw on Craigslist Chicago an elderly/disabled 62 and older low-income apartment,  charging 30% of one's income. 

I am very low income, so should qualify. 

From pictures I've seen around various internet sites, the building looks low income -- no surprise there.

But I don't mind spartan, just not dangerous. 

It's at 6900 S. Crandon Ave/Street.  Zip code 60649.  The ad calls it the South Shore neighborhood (or is South Shore an area more than a neighborhood?).

Yes, I've done online searches, and it's far from the Loop and northside by public transit.

Even a CVS or Walgreens seems a mile or more walk, but I think an Aldi is near but no Jewel, Trader Joe's or Whole Foods Market in such a zip code, unsurprising.

Seems kind of close to the Lake and beaches and a cultural center...but still maybe a hassle to regulary access on foot?

Maybe a branch library nearby?

...

I have lived in the Boston area all my adult life and enjoy and appreciate its relatively high quality of living, despite the high cost of rents.

But I might need to relocate to Chicago for a friend, and I've always liked the ""desirable""  parts of Chicago on my two very brief visits, in 1994 and 2011.

I'm a hockey fan, so would cheer for the Blackhawks!  I guess this neighborhhood cheers for the White Sox, not the Cubs?

I am a gay, white, husky male, somewhat strong, but can't really fight well if attacked.  I have a Bachelor's degree, but have done blue collar jobs most of my life. Will I not fit in in this zip code? Maybe not too gay friendly around there?

Oh, I can't afford your north side gay-friendly neighborhoods.

Just stay away from that vicinity, or might be worth it for low rent and to live alone?

Problem is I like to ride the safer parts of Boston subways and trolleys...whether for errands or even fun and relaxation!...of course I encounter some disturbed people, but I can tolerate them if not dangerous. If I nod off in the daytime wnd even nights on the parts of our transit I use, I don't fear my safety.

Yes, I understand I couldn't safely do that in much of Chicago's transit system, at leasf at night.

And I like to stroll the safer neighbors in Boston and nearby...even at night, and I feel comfortable.  

But not sure I could safely walk from the Chicago public transit station or bus stop to this address at night, but daytime should be fine? And I think I read it's not that near an actual subway line but closer to a ""Metra?"" line into downtown?  Hmmm...

Thanks!

...oh, and I'm not sure if I should post such questions in the main Chicago sub or here.

"Early 40s/F Fine Art Photographer, visiting Chicago Mid Sept. What should I remove/add/replace from my options?","Hi, Y'all. 

I'm a dark botanical photographer from Montreal, QC. Hoping you can provide some insight on my upcoming trip. I really love all kinds of art and anything weird or obscure, dive bars . I also love creative and delicious food/wine, local beer and a well made cocktail without sweetness.   
  
I'll be traveling solo mid-ish September and have been furiously Googling all the things I'd like to do and now I have the problem of too many things on my list.   
  
I'll be there for 5 days but leave on a Saturday, so I don't have a weekend in the city.  Mostly looking for things to cull from my list based on the following:

I'll be staying at a hostel near lincoln park. part of what I love about travelling is the temporary friends you make for the day/evening in bars, cafes, solo dining, etc.  
  
 I have 2 modes, one where I am super engaged and chatty and the other where I feel incredibly uncomfortable and want to crawl out of my skin and they largely depend on vibes of the people there. :)

 I'm in my early 40's (present a bit younger) and mildly witchy/alt/artsy (wear mostly dark or black clothing, tattoos, etc)  and am looking for places that are good for either talking to bartenders (during the day when they're not busy) or regulars that are friendly and welcoming in neighborhoods outside Lincoln Park. Would also love to talk to other artists/fine art photographers/creatives.

 I probably won't be doing late nights with heavy drinking, but would like to see local live acts close to my hostel (near Lincoln Park)

 For the evenings, I would, in large prefer to stay around the Lincoln Park area where I could walk back to my hostel, but if there's a spot I shouldn't miss or that's close to one of the restaurants on my list, I'm open.

These are the places/touristy stuff/shopping I have so far. Are there any things that I might have missed or should skip? 

Also, for any photographers, should I bother bringing a wide angle lens based on street configurations/architectural detail etc or will I be okay with a 55-250mm f/4-5.6? 

Based on the above, will I feel uncomfortable at any of the bars/restaurants on my list having a drink/dining alone?  

My list:

Tourist Stuff:

-Architectural boat tour (for the photography, open to alternatives)  
-MCA  
-Museum Of Contemporary Photography  
-Smart Museum of Art

-Hoping I can also still get ice cream served by a puppet at the Sugar Hole



Dining Solo for Breakfast/lunch and dinner. 

Only two I know for sure I must go to are Tyzub and Indienne. Open for opinions to the rest.

  Not veg but am 'carry an EpiPen allergic' to crustaceans (not mollusks or fish) and prefer not having to ask for substitutions for tasting menus or worrying about potential accidents/contamination/hidden crustacean (nam phrik kapi, bouillabaisse, some fish stocks, etc)  :

-Sideshow Gallery  
-Mailway Bros (thinking about attending the tarot group while I'm there)  
-The Occult Bookstore ( hoping they have an occult society event happening)  
-Alchemy Arts Occult Supply

-RR #1  
-Komoda  
-WolfBait &amp; B-Girls  
-Paperish Mess

Subject: Urgent Request for Increased Security on East Division Street

Dear Alderman Hopkins,

I’m writing as a concerned resident of the Gold Coast neighborhood regarding the alarming spike in crime along East Division Street, particularly between State Street and Lake Shore Drive.

Since the recent openings of the Galleria Club and Gold Coast Social, our neighborhood has experienced a troubling increase in robberies, assaults, and even murders. What was once a quiet and safe residential area has become unrecognizable—and unsafe.

It is unacceptable that residents no longer feel safe walking in their own neighborhood. I am asking you to take immediate action by: •	Increasing the presence of police or private security patrols during evening and late-night hours •	Implementing a curfew or stricter enforcement of loitering and noise ordinances for nightlife venues •	Re-evaluating the licenses and community impact of establishments contributing to this unsafe environment

I hope you will treat this issue with the urgency it deserves before further harm is done. We need leadership that protects residents and restores peace to our community.

If you’ve experienced anything similar or are just tired of feeling unsafe in this neighborhood, please speak up or contact Alderman Hopkins.

Still shaking. Texted with Uber ADT safety agent. Should I report this driver?,"*Edit/update:* Hi everybody - thank you for your responses. I have a small update. I had some trouble navigating the app to report, but good news is, the ADT Safety agent's documentation did it for me. Uber support sent me a message referencing my contacting the ADT safety agent, apologizing, refunding the trip, and saying they would ""take appropriate steps to address this incident with your driver."" Highly recommend using that ADT safety feature, it was very helpful for me and just fyi if you ever use it, it looks like it automatically creates a report. I think that's a nice touch, bc if/when you're frazzled afterwards, it makes it easier for you.



I appreciate a lot of these comments. Most are very helpful and kind. That said, I would also appreciate if you could refrain from certain types of comments. Some of these are making me feel pretty bad. Yes, part of the reason why I felt stupid was that maybe I was overreacting, but the other reason why was that I felt silly for not managing to get out earlier and silly for thinking it was an overreaction. And while I'm sure people mean well, some of these comments are making me feel worse about that. Please excuse me if I'm misreading things, but some of them read like I'm an idiot for ever hesitating. That's not very helpful. It was confusing and I was tired and it wasn't totally clear cut in the moment; he's a 4.99 star driver with 5000 rides, it was raining so hard the streets were running like rivers, and there weren't many opportunities to pull over. I got out when I did, and it's reported now, and that's what matters.



Thank you all, and good night.



--------------------------************************************




Hi everybody. This just happened and I'm not really sure what to do next.



I was in an Uber leaving the city. We were about to enter the tunnel to leave the city and he says he's really sorry but something's wrong with his tire, the pressure, and he thinks it's unsafe and doesn't want to risk going on the highway without getting it fixed. I asked him what that meant, like does that mean he has to cancel the ride, and he said no he just has to fix it first and it should be pretty quick. It's also dark and pouring rain (like, biblical rain) and crazy traffic outside. I say ok bc I don't really know what else to do. I do feel a little on edge bc it doesn't feel right, but I'm not sure what to do. So I start frantically looking through the safety features in the app. But I also feel stupid, like maybe my instincts are wrong and it's totally fine and I should just calm down.




But then it takes really long, like we go far enough that we're now closer to the other, uptown tunnel. We pass a gas station and I ask him why he can't just go there to add air to his tires and he says he needs more than that and we need to go to a shop. This feels like a massive red flag to me. I ask him where we're going then, specifically? And he just says some shop and we're really close and it shouldn't take long. I'm starting to get a little freaked out bc while he seemed like a normal guy, it just feels shady. I asked him to pull over and let me out, bc I see a pharmacy. He says the shop and the tunnel are both so close it doesn't make sense for me to get out now bc it'd be a waste of my time and it'd be impossible for me to get another car in this traffic in this rain near the tunnel and it'll just be harder for me, and he apologizes again. Car drives past the pharmacy.



Earlier, I'd opened the safety button in the Uber app and I started texting with an ADT Safety agent. She tells me it's weird and not normal and I should try to get out of the car. She said if a driver has an issue with their car that they need fixed, they're supposed to end the trip and then go to get it fixed. Knowing this is the final red flag that freaks me out. She tells me again to try and get out. I see a hotel the next block and I tell him to please drop me off. We argue a bit, and I feel kind of bad bc it was tense. But I was really freaked out at this point. He does pull over and I get out. He drives away and I feel so weird and dramatic for it, but I'm shaking and crying and don't even know why.



The ADT safety agent was super nice, told me she was glad I was out of the car. She said it's really weird and she's never heard of a driver doing that before, and that I should report him, and she sent me a link.



Should I report him? I was seriously freaked out and felt unsafe. And he didn't follow protocol. But what if it's just a misunderstanding? If anything, he probably thinks I was upset bc of wasted time--no! I was upset bc I felt unsafe and it just got shadier and shadier and weirder and weirder. If it's just a misunderstanding and it's an important source of income for him or something, I'd feel pretty guilty causing trouble. But at the same time, he should've done what the ADT safety agent said was protocol and ended the trip to get his car fixed and dropped me off somewhere away from the tunnel entrance mouth so I could safely get another ride. I feel conflicted and am still pretty shaken, so please be kind.",TwoXChromosomes,1110,1722733307.0,149,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ejiyqy/still_shaking_texted_with_uber_adt_safety_agent/,"Still shaking.

"UPDATE: Unmarried man[37] will be having his daughter[16] stay with him for a while. The catch is, we haven't seen each other since she was 5.  Bonding Ideas?","Original Thread:
[Original]http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14vfku/reddit_women_unmarried_man37_will_be_having_his/

First I want to thank people for their advice on the original thread.  A lot of it was very helpful and it was a self confidence boost to know I was on the right track.  Thanks!

I've never been a particularly emotional guy.  Surely, I know the feeling of love  and I know the joy of a hug from my niece but 6 months ago if someone had told me I'd cry tears in happiness I would have thought them crazy.  As I waited near the baggage claim I had the worst case of butterflies in my entire life.  A first/second date didn't even compare with the turmoil I had going on and as I waited I was able to occupy my mind with every horrible scenario possible for Liz's visit.  Meeting Liz I was greeted with a full on tight hug which, right off the bat, started kicking my emotional butt but then she quickly followed that with a ""I'm so happy to finally get to  hug my Dad.""  It took every ounce of fake man cough I could muster to hold the tears at bay.  I start with this because it pretty much embodies her entire visit.  Between our initial meeting and her departure I had to use the fake cough, clearing of throat or sudden bathroom visit on more than a handful of occasions.  

We did a lot of fun things during her visit.  Went skiing, ice skating, saw a Broadway show.  Lots of firsts for her since she's only lived in a much warmer climate.  I'm glad I was warned about giving her personal time/space.  She wanted her alone time and I probably would have been either worried or annoyed had I not mentally prepared myself ahead of time.  We share a common interest in science and wanted to see where I worked so we spent a day doing that.  I know the parents out there will think ""Well no duhh"" but while visiting my work Liz showed a sincere understanding of a few concepts and I felt such an overwhelming feeling of pride.  I was completely taken off guard by it! 

""I love you"" was finally said the night before her flight home.  Throughout the visit I danced around it a bit to see her reaction but I refused to have her leave without hearing the words.  That evening, as we were scanning in photos I had saved from before I left, I told her about how on several occasions I almost threw these away but could never do it.  The box followed this unsentimental guy through years of grad school, medical school and several moves between different states after that.  More than once I placed it into the garbage only to go and dig it out later because I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to our story together.  I took the opportunity to explain to her how I have a 5 year relationship with her in my memory that she doesn't equally share and because of this I need to tell her that I loved her.  I loved her then and I love her now.   As we sat in silence the moments following and I considered how a better man than myself would not have walked away, regardless of what a stupid DNA test said, I noticed her holding back the tears this time.  

So where does it go from here?  We've decided we're going to see each other monthly even though it's a bit of flying to accomplish it.  She also wants to spend spring break and summer vacation with me and I'm quite excited about it.   After an 11 year gap I'm a Dad again and I love it.

"New Grad Moving to Chicago (Transit, Airport, Safety, Green Spaces, etc.)","Hi everyone! Like some previous posts here, I am considering moving to Chicago soon. To focus the discussion a bit (and help you all think about recommendations), I have identified some of my must-haves and hopes and some previous research I have done.

About Me:

* Remote job, but occasionally will need to travel domestically (sometimes outside of the Chicago area)
* Mid-20s living alone

Must haves:

* Budget: One-bedroom apartment under $1500. (edit: is this reasonable or too low?)
* Public transit: CTA (bus and/or the L) is a must, Metra would be nice but not necessary.
* Decent access to airports: I will be traveling occasionally as a part of my job, including going to airports. I prefer to be closer to O'Hare because I also use that airport to fly home. Think 75 minutes to O'Hare with transit max. For Midway, I am less concerned right now.
* Safety: Generally I am hearing that other than some south neighborhoods, places are safe as long as I avoid a couple of blocks in any neighborhood. Correct me if I am wrong for the neighborhoods you are aware of.
* Groceries: Walking or transit distance - 15 minutes.
* Retail: A good number of restaurants, shops, and cafes. It does not have to be like downtown, but I would like to eat out sometimes!
* Green space: Generally I would like to have sidewalks that have green space in the residential parts of town so that I don't go crazy. Some good parks nearby are a plus!

Hopes: Access to gyms nearby

I also had some time to visit some of the neighborhoods that people mentioned on this thread or others during the day. Here are my (personal) reactions. Feel free to comment on my observations as well, as I just walked around in the following areas:

* Edgewater/Uptown: A good hub for young people and a good mix of families and elders. Having Lake Michigan is nice, quiet residential areas, and good pockets of restaurants and shops. The only con here is that going to O'Hare in particular takes more than an hour.
* Old Town: I saw more housing complexes than individual houses (just observation). There's good stuff to do in Wells Street (pretty good and lively).
* Palmer Square / Logan Square: Less red brick buildings south of Logan Square, more red brick in Palmer Square; Boulevards! Heard that these areas are on the expensive side...?
* Avondale: There are houses of various styles and colors, which I liked. Good amount of green space.
* Jefferson Park: I went south of the Metra/CTA transit center and the Jefferson Park (park) is a bit barren so I personally didn't like that. I also saw the north side has a better variety of houses than the south side (splitting by that transit center).

These following neighborhoods I did not have a chance to go to: Wicker Park / Bucktown area and Lake View.

"I was almost taken/trafficked in Austin, Tx","This is the most traumatizing thing that's ever happened to me. I have never told most people about this and I want to get the word out to other women about how easily this can happen, how quickly you can be caught off guard, and how even safe places can have predators. 

It was terrifyingly similar to the actual movie Taken, but it happened in Austin, Tx. There is a very popular bar district downtown here, it's like a strip and super busy with college kids. I was 21 years old and I was out with my husband and 4 of his friends (all guys). So it was me and 5 decent sized men and this still happened. 

We were all out drinking and having a great time. I had stopped on the busy street in front of one of the bars to talk to a door guy I knew, and my husband and the guys walked off in front of me. I had just said bye to the door guy and I was trailing behind the guys by about 15 feet. I was noticeably drunk, I was stumbling a bit. I'm a small woman, 90 lbs. Suddenly a car pulls over next to me and rolls down the window, it's a charismatic and good-looking guy in his 20s. He goes ""Hey! I'm your uber! Get in"" and unlocks the door. I looked over and felt ever-so-slightly off and went ""No, I didn't call an uber"" and kept walking. The car started rolling along next to me and the guy is saying through the window ""No you didn't call, your friend called. We're here to pick you up. Get in."" And I stopped walking, for the slightest second, and glanced to the car with a funny face. By that point I knew it was weird. It was already happening so fast, maybe 20 seconds went by so far. As soon as my eyes landed on the car, the driver turned to the backseat and said something fast in another language. The backdoor flies open and there are 2 other guys sitting there, about his same age, and they are all eastern-european (maybe greek?) with accents.  My eyes went wide and the guys lunged forward, grabbed me by the waist and yanked me into the car. I was gone and in the car in under a second. I screamed in the loudest, most blood curdling way I could muster, NOOOOOOOO. My husband's best friend about 15 feet ahead hears me first, stops dead in his tracks and starts bolting towards me. The driver starts driving right away and the guys in the back try slamming the door behind me.

They had my wrists but I stuck my leg between the car and the door right before he tried to slam it, so it bounced off my leg and my husband's best friend grabs the door. Then they  pulled my leg in and were able to shut the door and lock it. 

I'm screaming, they're driving away. The rest of my group is running to us, the bouncer we were in front of comes running to me, and him and husband's best friend run after the car a few feet and yank me out of the still open window by my arms, while the car is still moving.  I'm still screaming and kicking. On my way out of the car I kick the driver in the chest. They sped away, turned and were gone.

I'm crying. My husband is crying. The bouncer calls the police to report it. It's a whole scene. I left immediately, I rushed home in a panic and didn't stay around for the report. Don't know if anything ever happened with it. I never gave them my information. I was honestly so traumatized and in a state of shock that I never did anything or told anyone else. My friends that were with me (and my husband primarily) struggled with tremendous guilt for a long time. Nobody felt like they reacted fast enough, or harsh enough, or just that they let me lag behind at all. It changed all of us forever and I'm still terrified of being anywhere alone and of being taken. 

I was 21 and I was basically kidnapped. There were a few seconds I was completely locked in the car and they were driving off, holding me tightly and restraining my limbs. They were talking a foreign language and I knew in that moment 100% that I would be trafficked and thought it would be the last time I ever saw my husband or my friends. 

It was a perfectly normal night in a well-lit, busy, decent area of town and I was with a group of men who would've protected me. And they pounced on me immediately because they thought I was alone. 

Be extremely wary of cab drivers and people claiming they are uber and lyft when you are out. Always confirm on the app that someone is your driver, and never stand too close to cars when you are on the sidewalk. I know that last one may seem paranoid, but if you are in a vulnerable position (I was drunk, dressed sexy, seemingly alone outside of a club), you need to be extremely wary of your surroundings and how quickly the unexpected can happen.

neighbor having a crush on me ruining my life,"my (26f) older, married neighbor (60sm) and i had a weird interaction yesterday and it's making me fearful to leave my apartment and go on walks with my dog. 

this neighbor lives in the apartment building across from me, but i frequently take my dog out in that area because he doesn't like to use the bathroom near my apartment. this neighbor has a dog he walks that's befriended my dog so we talk occasionally. 

yesterday, i ran into this neighbor while walking my dog. he started following me to start a conversation, and was saying and doing a lot of weird things. this includes touching my hair because he ""liked the color of it"" and asking me if what i was wearing was what i wore to bed and that he ""usually wears nothing because it's so hot."" 

eventually i walked away but when i circled back to my apartment he appeared out of nowhere and wanted to continue the conversation. he started asking me what my car i drove and where it was parked and if i was ""happy"" because supposedly he saw me crying from my window (for context: my room faces the main street, so if you're absolutely looking through you can see my room - which i've noticed he does every time he passes by). he then asked me if i liked dancing and if he could take me out, which i thought was a joke. then he asked me about my boyfriend, who he's met a few times, and started going on a tangent about how he should ""be here with me more often"" and ""take me out more."" 

the real kicker was when he asked me for a hug and for my number so he could ""call me"" and i immediately told him ""no."" he called out to me and said it makes his heart happy when he sees me and i rushed back to my apartment. 

i've told my dad and my boyfriend about the interaction, and i'm considering talking to the man's son to ask him to tell his dad to lay off. but as someone who's been previous SA-ed and harassed, it gives me so much anxiety to be in situations like this to the point it's thrown my entire routine into a loop and i hate it.

Trying to move to Chicago from out of state in May/June - where in Lakeview would be a good spot for me?,"I’m sorry, I know there’s a lot of these posts. My girlfriend and I are moving to IL from out of state. We visited last year, fell in love with it and have some family ties nearby. 

After a lot of thinking on the right neighborhood, we settled on Lakeview East. We can’t visit extensively right now, but heard it’s a really safe/solid choice to spend your first few year in the city, and has basically everything you need. Sold!

I guess now the question is determining where. Honestly, I don’t want to be in the heart of the chaos, (like in the more fratty areas near Wrigleyville - although I love the Cubs!). I’m close to 30 and really value a quiet home life, but within proximity of a vet, restaurants, public transit, etc. I’m not a huge drinker but I like trying new foods, I’d like to be by the lake where there’s more greenery and places to hang out with my dog. I think safety is sort of number one, and just being near a good CTA stop and some good lightning at night. 

I don’t know if that’s a lot to go off of. I work from home and am about $80k ish per year. My girlfriend is a bit more extroverted, it’ll be her first time living in a city. She wants opportunities to make friends and she’ll need transit for work. She’s also expressed a desire to be near some greenery, but also wants to be close by to bars and restaurants. And like I mentioned, we have a small dog so any areas very close by where he can walk around and hang out is good. I think being around people like us is ideal….sort of in between college grads and parents, I guess. 

I know how annoying I must sound here. I guess I’m just struggling. I’m trying to find and avoid the right property managers (Beal), I’m trying to find maybe the best parts of Lakeview for my personality (I think we both value quiet evenings indoors but being in proximity to fun stuff, although we know being in the city = more noise overall, which is fine - mostly just trying to avoid the young 20s party scene). 

Does anyone maybe have any suggestions on parts of the neighborhood that may be good? Streets, realtors, property groups, anything? Honestly any help is appreciated I’ve been going through a lot the past few months and I’ve tried to do as much research as I can, but actually being able to get some more suggestions from people there would be so so helpful

Where can I park in Rogers Park without being towed?,"Help needed--parking around Rogers Park

UPDATE: I went to a currency exchange and got my parking stickers. So easy! Thanks all for your help. 

TLDR I have a car and I need to park it on the street as near to Loyola Ave as possible without getting towed or playing musical cars every 2-4 hours parking and reparking, or paying exorbitant structure fees. I am unwilling to sell my car--long story but an absolute dealbreaker.

Context: 

Hello all, I've just moved to the Loyola area. I love it, I can walk to the lake (!), but parking is such a pain--seems like it's all a tow zone at random hours so you can never be safe. 😂 It was $119 to stay in a structure for 7 days but that's not sustainable.

I've applied for my parking sticker and should hear back within 10 days, but it's the gov so I expect they'll draw out the process for weeks. That's how it is in Michigan, maybe it's better here. In the meantime, is there an area you know of that's safe to park in either all the time or in longer blocks than 2-4 hours? Maybe a side street in a suburbanish area (bearing in mind I'm a petite woman who would be walking alone very late at night at times so can't go too far out of radius). I've heard Devon and Sheridan but from everything I've seen on foot, Sheridan is just as bad as anywhere else. I'll go hunting on Devon later today, but any help would be appreciated.

Thanks all, this doesn't feel like ""my"" state yet, but I believe it was in my best interest to GTFO of Michigan. My only complaint is I won't be able to vote in a swing state anymore.

commute from ogilvie to north chicago?,"I've scoped out the Metra train and it looks like it would be 1 hour 45 minutes total if I'm walking to the station and from the station to my destination. 1 hour 20 minutes if I am riding my bike. 

I do have a car and considered this as well but have heard horror stories about the rush hour traffic. Google says between 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes by car in the morning, 50 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes in the evening. It gets better the closer to 6pm I get. 

  
Which would you do? Are there any alternate routes that avoid traffic coming from west loop to North Chicago?

The Metra sounds nice but looking at videos of the inside it doesn't seem like the greatest place to sit for 1.5 hours. If they had outlets I could plug into that's obviously a game changer because then I could do stuff on my computer to kill time. Alternatively driving has the potential to be a shorter ride (if google maps estimation is correct) but far more boring and will feel longer because I'm driving versus getting work done or reading a book or playing a game. 

  
If I were to drive in the middle of the night to North Chicago, it'd be a 40 minute drive. Zero traffic, I can't make it a shorter commute than that. If I can get my commute close to this guaranteed, that'd be ideal. 

Let me know what y'alls thoughts are on riding the Metra, especially for that long - in comparison to driving instead. Particularly if you know any side streets I could take that would avoid a lot of traffic.

Honest thoughts about Bronzeville concerning safety (specifically for women)?,"Edit #1 9/8/25: I added that I read posts in this subreddit from 3-5 ish years ago with similar questions and am wondering if anything has changed since then. I read the neighborhood notes from the subreddit. I am also in a group on Facebook for women based in Chicago and so far a few women said they have enjoyed living there and feel safe. 

Edit #2 9/8/25: Corrected statement about Hyde Park being a 10 minute walk from the house. It is actually a 32 minute walk and a 7 minute car ride and 16 minutes away by public transit. 

Hi! My boyfriend and I are looking to move to buy a house in Bronzeville. The house is about a 7-minute drive to Hyde Park. I’ve read older posts dated a few years ago similar to this one regarding the safety of Bronzeville, and was wondering what your thoughts are and if anything has changed since I read those older posts. 

We have done a little bit of research on the area to evaluate what kind of crime may be present. I would be likely living there by myself to settle in for a few months while my boyfriend moves everything from a different state entirely. I’m wanting to know how safe it is for women to walk around by themselves (while of course following basic safety tips such as not looking completely clueless and not walking around late at night). 

I read that the Green line is alright during the day but that it can get dicey at night. 

Please give your honest feedback about the area. I am new to Chicago aside from having visited a handful of times, and while I do have some general understandings of what areas to avoid, I am especially curious about Bronzeville. My understanding is that Bronzeville has a significant history within Chicago. 

Thank you!

Can you please critique my itinerary/give suggestions for next time?,"My sister and I came to Chicago last Thursday and overall it was a good experience. 

First Day:
-took CTA orange line to hotel 
-Went to Nutella cafe — good since we like Nutella 
-Strolled millenium park 
-Went to the Maggie Daley park — I love the Pedestrian Bridge don’t know why lol 
-Got lunch from Chicago dawgs — loved it but it was too acidic for my sis. Didn’t realize they didn’t the poppy seed bun there 😭
-Visited the Fine arts building— just to ride the manual elevator 😅
-Visited the Chicago cultural center— I love that place!!
-Went to Palmer House hotel— great architecture
-Architecture Boat Tour with Wendella— amazing experience. We booked 7:30 so we were able to get the sunset plus city lights at night time 
-Grabbed dinner from Wilma’s famous BBQ— we were tired and hungry after the tour and randomly chose this but it wasn’t good… 
-Ubered and walked to get around

Second Day: 
-Took the water taxi to Chinatown 
-Strolled Ping Tom Memorial Park 
-went to the Chinese American museum 
-got lunch from the Richland center — can’t remember where; was ok I think I picked wrong 
-Walked all over Chinatown square 
-Walked the area where the Pui Tak Center is, got food etc.
-We picked up dinner from Go 4 Food and it was sooo good! Their duck was delicious 
-We took the bus to go back to our hotel 
-We went to the Starbucks Reserve at nighttime 

Third Day:
-Got breakfast from Medici on 57th 
-Walked all over the university of Chicago campus, saw the Rockfeller memorial etc
-Went to ISAC
-Went to Midway Plaisance Park and we got to talk to some locals who were having a huge “HS reunion” type stuff 
-Went to 57th street beach 
-Had a late lunch at 14 Parish — the jibarito was good!
-Went to Jackson park, Japanese garden etc
-Walked Museum Campus a little bit 
This was the hardest day cause we kept getting lost… we walked so much! And then we got a taxi (not uber this time) when we wanted to go from 14 Paris to Jackson park and we ended up telling him to just drop us off wherever. We got into his vehicle and he didn’t follow the route then when we mapped it ourselves and realized we were too far from where he wanted to drop us off at, and when we told him he said that we entered the wrong address on purpose to it could be cheaper. We were like ok cool thanks we’d rather walk than deal with this 
-Later that night we went to LH Rooftop. Didn’t even get drinks but the view was everything!!! 

Fourth Day:
-Walked the RiverWalk — very scenic 
-Walked to Grant park to see the fountain etc. 
-Didn’t have time to visit the Art Institute but I went to the gardens 
-Then I got on the bus to go back towards La Salle… and ended up on 24th and Balbo street cause I got on the bus going in the opposite direction. The bus driver told me to get off, cross the sreet and get on the next bus. I must admit that I was a bit scared cause I didn’t see much activity around and idk the area. 
-The we got Lou Malnatis pizza - it was very disappointing lol I know better based on reviews but my sis wanted it 
-Then we transferred over to Lincoln park and went to the Zoo and conservatory 
-We went to Art Effect on Armitage 
-We went to several shops in Lincoln Square 
-We had dinner at Ciccio Mio and it was the best meal I’ve had during my stay 

Last Day: 
-Did a little shopping on Mag Mile
-Transferred over to Armitage (again) because I really wanted to visit the little quirky shops there 
-Then we did WNDR museum — super underwhelming but my sister wanted to 

I wish I had planned out the food better but I was more interested in seeing and doing things. 

All the horror stories I heard abt Chicagoans being rude turned out to be false. People were so nice and helpful. Not everyone was super smily but they were nice and they even say hi when passing you on the streets. 

Overall I think Chicago is a great city to visit and I can’t wait to be back!

Can some ladies shed some light on what the hell happened to me the other night?,"22 year old male virgin here. I am not completely clueless about women, just inexperienced. I think I've made a lot of progress over the past 2 or 3 years but I am still no lady killer. Anyways heres the story:

Im travelling through Europe right now, backpacking by myself, staying in hostels and what not. I am generally pretty shy, but a few nights ago I met up with an old friend in Poland and one thing led to another. I ended up meeting some of his friends friends friends, next thing I know I am on a college campus at a party. I meet this girl, Ill call her ""M"". I get a lot more social when I drink, and thats exactly what happened. We are hitting it off quite well. Somebody suggest we go to the club, Im all for that. Im pretty buzzed and feeling pretty confident. I get restless and grab her hand and playfully pull her away suggesting its time to go. She laughs, agrees, and were on our way. The rest of the group slowly starts following, but were ahead of them by a minute or so. She puts here arm around my waist, so im like ""fuck it"" and put my arm around her shoulder. Were walking down this path, side by side, flirting and whatnot, its kind of dark with not to many people around. She suggest we stop and wait for the others. I pull her into a little clearing off to the side that is dark. We start making out. Everything is going great. The rest of the group catches up and we continue on our way. The walk is about 30 min, the whole time were holding hands and kissing a lot. I will say that she was a little drunk, but still totally coherent. She stopped drinking after we left though so she would only have gotten more sober as the night went on. I ask her what she is doing tomorrow, it doesn't sound like much so I ask her if she wants to hang out. She did seem a little reluctant, but eventually she agrees and and gives me her number. We get to the club and for the rest of the night we have a great time. We kissed *alot*, danced quite a bit, got to know each other more, laughed together, and there was a lot of intense eye contact. I had every reason to believe this girl actually liked me. On the dance floor I was grabbing her ass quite a bit, and even rubbed her between the legs a little. If that doesn't tell me she is into me, I dont know what does. Eventually the place closes down and we have to leave. We walk outside together and make out some more. We talked some more about meeting the next day a little more before she leaves. I go back to the hostel and can hardly sleep I am so excited. 
When I wake up I just lie there waiting for her to text me. Finally she does, and this is what it says: ""Hey, I cant meet you today, its complicated. You should go to Warsaw"". ( I had told her I was going to Warsaw that day before we made plans). I just layed there in shock and disappointment for 20 min. I cannot figure out what happened, we left on a really good note and she seemed to really like me.
So can I get some insight into what happened, how I screwed this up? 

The best I can think of is that she realized that since I was a tourist, I wouldn't have been around for more than a few days. She wasn't looking for a one night stand because she isn't that kind of girl, and obviously a long term relationship would be impossible. Maybe she figured that meeting up with me wouldn't really go anywhere good.

So looking for easy with kids dinner and lunch recs… as well as things to do. My plan was Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum but idk if other spots might be more fun. My 5yo is obsessed with Ancient Egypt and Greece. They love art and animals and dinosaurs and princesses, etc but we live in Houston and have great museums (childrens museums and a Color Factory) as well. 

I personally like fun/funky/interactive art installations (they did Meow Wolf over Spring Break and crushed). Its gonna be hot but didnt bring swimsuits so dont want to do beach/splash pads.

Food-wise they love pizza (more thin crust gals than deep dish but open to spots bonus points if near the Drake and quick-ish), Mexican food, typical American kid crap (burgers, shakes, fries, tendies, etc), and they LOVE breakfast. Diners, pancakes/eggs, etc.

What you got?!
