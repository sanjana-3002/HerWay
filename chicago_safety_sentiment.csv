How (un)safe is Pink + blue line to O’Hare 11pm-2am with big bags?,"So I’ll  to go to O’Hare from California pink line then take the blue line at the loop. I have two bags and will go alone.
For what I’ve read the best is stick to the first car and that it won’t be pleasant anyways.

Is it really “unsafe”? Like what I’ve really find on the posts is like “better Uber” “better if you are not alone” “better the first car” “better not do it” “I wouldn’t risk it” but like I haven’t heard a real reason more than anxiety or fear, does something bad actually happens at this hours on the trains?

Also what you think is the best/safest(?) hour to do the ride between 11pm to 2am? I planned first arriving early leaving at 11pm but on one post I saw people felt a little better early morning than late night, so now I’m considering too, what you think?




——————————— My experience with pink line at midnight and blue line at midnight ———————————

Update of my experience doing this. 
Sorry it became a story time so conclusion: At the end I never felt unsafe and it wasn’t bad for me, but remember there’s always risk and if you have ride alternatives it’s always better to pay a little extra for your safety.

I post this here because on my search of pink line at midnight and blue line at midnight there weren’t really many experiences or at least not recent and I’m just gonna put mine here in hope someone else can check it out and see ONE person experience doing this around midnight. (Again this was just MY experience and it doesn’t mean it’s gonna be the same for you, I would hope this was easy and safe for everyone, but there’s still many doubts and people feel unsafe)

So here goes my experience at midnight from California pink line going to Clark and lake and then the blue line to O’Hare on a Sunday.

First what you need to check is what’s your best option, if you have the chance of using Uber/lift or whatever, I wouldn’t doubt about it if I could really afford it (maybe some folks think that if you can travel you have an extra $70 for a ride, but it’s not at all everyone’s option)

Then if you decide to go for public transportation then check options of buses and trains maybe it’s not great traveling on this with luggage but it won’t be for that long and if you think you can deal with that then you go and check the actual times that certain bus/train is working at that certain day, so in my case the last pink train was at 1am and the first at 5am(wouldn’t have worked for me to wait that long)
Then you decide what time to actually leave, I really think, and maybe it’s not a generalized thought, that always better the first train in the morning I.e.5am because there’s might be more people taking it for early shifts or something, or the earliest you can at night so maybe not wait until 1am and this is not just about security but also I’ve read that sometimes the trains at night just don’t arrive and people wait for hours or just go get an Uber because there’s no other option.

You will have to be rested cause you will have to wait long cold hours at the airport on the floor while taking care of your luggage, or just be a warrior and go through the pain with no sleeping, crying and praying. lol

Now how it actually went for me:
I decided to start with this the earliest I could that end up being 11:10pm. I had to walk with my 1 very big luggage, 1 carry on and 1 personal item all over the weight or dimensions limit. It was dark but I didn’t cross paths with any other human being until I was at the pink line station door at 11:20, tbh this 10 minutes where the ones I was actually the most afraid but nothing happened.

Then I had to wait like 10 minutes by myself, on the platform, again there was no one and I didn’t feel unsafe at any moment I actually expected there to be a drunk guy sleeping or something, but nothing.
I got to the first car of the L around 11:30 there where another 6 people with me minding their own business and once again no drunk or drugged guy, no crazy people either.
(AGAIN!!! This was MY experience I really think in most cases at any hour there will be someone making people uncomfortable or at least sleeping idk)
I arrived to Clark and lake before 11:50pm
And the worst part of all this journey was having to get my bag from that platform to the blue line. 
I have to say on the station there were like 2 or 3 guys sleeping but there was more people and even some police officers, so I really felt safe I think I just got lucky… more than usual.

Again it was horrible getting bags down even though there were this smelly slow elevator (you actually have to take 2 of this but hey, there’s at least the option!)
BUT it almost make me lose the blue line train. As soon as the door of the elevator opened, the train audio of doors closing was playing and I rushed to the nearest car of the train, which was the last, so I was getting ready for it to be a really bad experience. But there when I entered at least half of the seats were taken and actually just one homeless guy sleeping there and everyone else minding their own business with their headphones or on their phones, so again I felt safer knowing I wasn’t there alone with this big bags. During the way to the airport pay of the people left and just 3 of us make it to O’hare (including the sleeping guy) I arrived there were cleaners and some other people leaving from other cars and then that was it. (I counted people sleeping on the train cause I had to walk and there were just like 7 on the whole train)


Look, once again it was my experience and I think I was lucky I didn’t go through anything weird or crazy people, I honestly wasn’t really afraid of getting killed or mugged cause as I said when I placed the question I really don’t think it is that frequent that something like that happens, I know it does exceptional times but it’s not the rule. The time I’ve spent in Chicago I’ve seen crazy things/people on the trains at mostly every hour, and honestly think that there won’t ever be something like 100% guaranteed safety travel, but I also think this is the common rule for almost everywhere around the world, so yes the safest option will always be Uber or similars and if you have that option it’s always better not to risk it, but if you really have to go and do this midnight rides then chances are you gonna be okay, but there will always be the risk, also sadly from past experiences I’ve seen and I think women are more targeted, so it’s always better if you have someone to do this with and not by yourself, I honestly think this will give you a little extra layer of safety. Just always be aware of your surroundings, don’t hesitate to ask for help if it comes to it and if you have the chance to a safer ride always take it. If there’s no other option chances are you’ll be okay, but it’s never 100% guaranteed.

Why do people say the city is more dangerous than it is?,"Before I start, I'm not trying to be confrontational or dismissive. I'm genuinely confused at how people seem to overstate crime in many parts of the city. I feel like I'm missing perspective. Maybe a bit lucky. If any of this contradicts your experiences, I'm all ears.

I am not from Chicago originally, but I have lived here for over a year now. Multiple neighborhoods up and down the city. More specifically: Pilsen, Roseland, Rogers Park, Albany Park, Logan Square\*, and Belmont-Cragin, in that order. I also have worked around Norwood Park, Clearing, and Ukrainian Village. Suffice to say, I have a good feeling for what at least 90% of the city is like. Not one time did I walk the street fearing for my life. I never witnessed anything scarier than a drug deal or a loud argument (between people who already knew each other). The only time I heard gunshots was during the 4th of July when people were using them instead of fireworks. In fact, a lot of the time I walked at night, it was just me. By the way people online and offline talk, you'll think there's always a monster around the corner.

I'm not saying there isn't poverty in the city or crime is completely absent. I spent most of the last year effectively homeless and was victimized by a few white-collar scams\*\*. I also am aware of many parts of the city being working class or outright poor. The thing is, ""Chicago is scary"" isn't something exclusive to online suburbanites. The only difference is Chicagoans will get more granular and specify different neighborhoods.  Okay, fine so far, but who in the right mind is fearing Uptown? Where are the shootings going on in McKinley Park? Did anybody get mugged in Hermosa? I'm being completely serious here. Even the Loop seems to be portrayed as scary after dark. That last one in particular I can say is bullshit and a relic of how cities were in the 70s-80s.  
  
I personally have had to deal with violent, scary people, but only *once* it was somebody I didn't already know. It's of course my own personal experience, as I said I'm not here to dismiss anyone. It's just that I feel like the city has more to offer than right downtown, Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Wicker Park, and the ""civic worker suburb"" neighborhoods. The places where the claims of danger seem to be consistently backed up are some of the inner South Side (Fulton Park, Washington Park, Grand Crossing, Englewood) and West Garfield Park, plus a few small areas near them.

Am I the only one who feels like this? I hope I'm not just missing something.

How short is the road to racism?,"I live in Uptown. I as a white(ish) thirty-something male experience discomfort and some amount of fear around black people in certain specific contexts these days, because I have observed that they will target white people with certain types of harassment, depending on what the situation is. It is not uncommon for a black man, woman or child(!) to spit (on the ground as a sign of disrespect) as they pass me or my wife while walking down the sidewalk, for example. [There are the packs of black youths who have been mob-robbing white people on the street.](http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/06/chicagos_violent_flash_mobs.html) I've been targeted by kids gleefully throwing stuff at me while their older siblings look on with approval while I'm just trying to listen to my music on the train. I have also been attacked by a group of teenaged blacks who hit me over the head with bricks, etc, had me on the ground until the police showed up, just because I happened to walk by them in an area with not a lot of people around. I've always seen this as basically a way to reinforce a group unity via us vs. them, we are at war, our lives are rough because of white people, and more generally as a result of the segregation in this city, but the open hostility and animosity coming from that culture really starts to wear on your liberal sensibilities. I recently took a trip to St. Louis, where I didn't get that sense at all from the black people I encountered. But in Chicago there is just so much tension. Obviously the great majority of black people are decent, and there are plenty of white people who are indecent here. The point is the indecency in this case is racially directed from black to white. I just feel like, in this day and age, most people I know feel thusly: We are perfectly willing to accept any person of any race into our hearts, lives and communities. As such, it seems like the onus may be on black folks to ease racial tensions between whites and blacks, because it is the bad elements in their culture that continue to fan the flames.

While I believe most people are willing to treat black people with respectful color blindness because that's how my base behaves, that is likely not to be the norm, unfortunately.

As I have revealed, I am over thirty years old. The things I've described have happened over the course of time, and to other people close to me as well. It isn't as though I'm afraid to walk out of the house for fear of being attacked or cower and skitter in tense situations, nor do I feel as described above whenever I see a black person of any kind. It's usually pretty easy to tell who has a chip on their shoulder or who is out to mess with you. In addition to fairly regular passively or mildly aggressive behavior (like the spitting) I perceive, the attacks are things that have happened to me and people I know over the years, information I have first hand to illustrate my point that it's sometimes difficult to keep economic and other historic impetus for racism in mind when dealing with bad attitudes directed by blacks at whites.",chicago,66,1315328965.0,212,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/k6kte/how_short_is_the_road_to_racism/,"How short is the road to racism?

My thoughts moving to Dallas from Chicago,"I made a similar post on the Dallas sub and thought it would be fair to post here to share my thoughts for those considering a move to Dallas or to reinforce your decision to not move to Dallas. I grew up in the Southeast, ended up in the Midwest for school, then landed a job in Chicago after college and ended up calling Chicago my home for over a decade.

COVID really changed my view towards living in a city environment and changed my life preferences. I decided I wanted a bigger place to live that's more quiet and getting that in the city would be hard. I thought about moving to the suburbs but I figured if I was going to live in a suburban environment, why not move somewhere warmer and a bit lower cost (many Chicagoland suburbs are really expensive for housing). I applied at some jobs in Arizona, New Mexico, Florida and ended up getting a job in Dallas.

**Transportation:** Public transit in Chicago is really good and in most cases, as long as you live on the north side, you shouldn't need a car. I always lived on the south side, so my partner and I shared a car. One issue we did have with CTA, especially on the south side was safety. My ex was assaulted, both physically and verbally many times. I will say that driving in Dallas is much easier and more efficient than in Chicago. In the DFW area, as long as it's not rush hour and you just want to run a few errands, a 5 mile trip will take you no more than 10min. In short, I find it easier to do tasks on the weekends in Dallas. Going to Costco, grocery store, clothing shopping, lunch out, and Home Depot can be done in just a few hours.

**Safety:** This is the one thing Chicago is notorious for. Of course we all know that Fox News greatly over exaggerates the crime in Chicago, but we also know that there is a bit of truth to it. Everyone I know in Chicago has been involved in some sort of crime or ""sketchy stuff"" at some point in their lives. In Dallas the crime is concentrated around bad neighborhoods or happens at night in popular nightlife districts but it doesn't spill over into other areas. Statistics may say one thing but my partner says she ""feels"" significantly safer in the Dallas area compared to Chicago. At least once a week she felt uneasy on CTA or walking around the Loop after work when it's dark in winter.

**Employment opportunities:** Both Dallas and Chicago have great job opportunities and I find the salaries between the two to be very similar. One thing I liked about finding jobs in Chicago is that they were almost always in the Loop or close to the Loop so I didn't have to worry about moving after getting a new job. One thing about Dallas is that jobs are spread out all over rather than centralized to a downtown area. This can be a blessing and a curse depending on how you frame it. People who want to live in the suburbs and live 10min from work will love it. But the issue is that if you switch jobs, you have to be strategic as to where the job is to avoid a long commute. At least in Chicago with most jobs being downtown, you already know how your commute will be.

**Entertainment:** For such a large metro area, Dallas is incredibly boring to me. All of the Dallas natives say there are plenty of things to do, but it's not on the same level as Chicago. Dallas has museums and other cultural activities, same as Chicago, but there just really isn't a cool neighborhood vibe where you can get off the train and walk around and discover a new quirky bookstore, record shop, and find new bars. You have to actively search for things to do. But how do you know what to search for? Like for example I once found out about a Thai food festival after it happened because that's an oddly specific thing to search Google for. Another issue is that when you search for things to do in Dallas online, the majority of them are in the suburbs and those events always are more family oriented. As you can imagine, a taco festival in Pilsen will have a different vibe than taco festival in Schaumburg. 

**Bar scene:** One of the best parts of Chicago is the unique bar scene. Every neighborhood has bars that cater to different types of people. Dallas only has a few nightlife areas and most are just a single street with restaurants that also happen to serve drinks. I went to a ""bar"" that was highly recommended by locals and was so confused when I entered. It was literally a restaurant that just happened to have a bar serving drinks.

**Out of town trips:** In Chicago I really liked heading over to the Michigan beaches, Milwaukee for the day, or Wisconsin for some outdoor fun. In Dallas there really isn't a lot to do within a 2-3hr drive unless you like small Texas towns.

**Outdoor activities:** Chicago isn't the best outdoorsy city but it beats anything in Dallas which is probably one of the worst cities in the US for outdoor activities. People don't even leave their windows open because it's either too hot, too cold, or raining. I love camping and it's very hard to camp in Texas as almost all of the state is privately owned land. We don't have that many state parks and the ones closest to metro areas are always full on the weekends. 

**Politics:** For me this is a wash. If you are more left leaning, Texas is one of the worst states to live in because of how overly vocal and conservative the state officials are. But I wouldn't say that Chicago politics are any less toxic.

**People:** We always hear negative things about Texas on the news but I don't think that represents people who live here. I always find Texans to be very friendly and nice.

**Race relations:** This one is so awkward to discuss but it's something I noticed almost immediately after moving to Dallas. Chicago is a very segregated city and black, white, Hispanic, and Asian people seem to live totally separate lives. And the interactions between races, especially between black and white people felt very constrained. For some reason, I felt like black people in Chicago were hostile to non-black people and many non-black people were uncomfortable being around black people. In Dallas, I witness no such awkwardness. 

**Food:** The Chicago food scene is in general, better than Dallas but there are some areas where Dallas comes ahead. BBQ and Asian food is better quality and more readily available in Dallas. And surprisingly I find the tacos to be better in Chicago. In Dallas, most of the taco places are more TexMex and finding a taco place that's similar to Mexico City style isn't easy.

I think Dallas is a great place to live to further your career and we still have relatively low cost of living compared to other large metro areas. There are a lot of Chicagoland natives who have moved down this way and usually it's for lower COL and weather and just a more laid back lifestyle. I think the DFW metro area is a great place to buy a home and raise a family but may be lacking for people who aren't interested in this.",chicago,0,1715187046.0,135,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1cn9d8s/my_thoughts_moving_to_dallas_from_chicago/,"My thoughts moving to Dallas from Chicago I made a similar post on the Dallas sub and thought it would be fair to post here to share my thoughts for those considering a move to Dallas or to reinforce your decision to not move to Dallas. I grew up in the Southeast, ended up in the Midwest for school, then landed a job in Chicago after college and ended up calling Chicago my home for over a decade.

COVID really changed my view towards living in a city environment and changed my life preferences. I decided I wanted a bigger place to live that's more quiet and getting that in the city would be hard. I thought about moving to the suburbs but I figured if I was going to live in a suburban environment, why not move somewhere warmer and a bit lower cost (many Chicagoland suburbs are really expensive for housing). I applied at some jobs in Arizona, New Mexico, Florida and ended up getting a job in Dallas.

**Transportation:** Public transit in Chicago is really good and in most cases, as long as you live on the north side, you shouldn't need a car. I always lived on the south side, so my partner and I shared a car. One issue we did have with CTA, especially on the south side was safety. My ex was assaulted, both physically and verbally many times. I will say that driving in Dallas is much easier and more efficient than in Chicago. In the DFW area, as long as it's not rush hour and you just want to run a few errands, a 5 mile trip will take you no more than 10min. In short, I find it easier to do tasks on the weekends in Dallas. Going to Costco, grocery store, clothing shopping, lunch out, and Home Depot can be done in just a few hours.

**Safety:** This is the one thing Chicago is notorious for. Of course we all know that Fox News greatly over exaggerates the crime in Chicago, but we also know that there is a bit of truth to it. Everyone I know in Chicago has been involved in some sort of crime or ""sketchy stuff"" at some point in their lives. In Dallas the crime is concentrated around bad neighborhoods or happens at night in popular nightlife districts but it doesn't spill over into other areas. Statistics may say one thing but my partner says she ""feels"" significantly safer in the Dallas area compared to Chicago. At least once a week she felt uneasy on CTA or walking around the Loop after work when it's dark in winter.

**Employment opportunities:** Both Dallas and Chicago have great job opportunities and I find the salaries between the two to be very similar. One thing I liked about finding jobs in Chicago is that they were almost always in the Loop or close to the Loop so I didn't have to worry about moving after getting a new job. One thing about Dallas is that jobs are spread out all over rather than centralized to a downtown area. This can be a blessing and a curse depending on how you frame it. People who want to live in the suburbs and live 10min from work will love it. But the issue is that if you switch jobs, you have to be strategic as to where the job is to avoid a long commute. At least in Chicago with most jobs being downtown, you already know how your commute will be.

**Entertainment:** For such a large metro area, Dallas is incredibly boring to me. All of the Dallas natives say there are plenty of things to do, but it's not on the same level as Chicago. Dallas has museums and other cultural activities, same as Chicago, but there just really isn't a cool neighborhood vibe where you can get off the train and walk around and discover a new quirky bookstore, record shop, and find new bars. You have to actively search for things to do. But how do you know what to search for? Like for example I once found out about a Thai food festival after it happened because that's an oddly specific thing to search Google for. Another issue is that when you search for things to do in Dallas online, the majority of them are in the suburbs and those events always are more family oriented. As you can imagine, a taco festival in Pilsen will have a different vibe than taco festival in Schaumburg. 

**Bar scene:** One of the best parts of Chicago is the unique bar scene. Every neighborhood has bars that cater to different types of people. Dallas only has a few nightlife areas and most are just a single street with restaurants that also happen to serve drinks. I went to a ""bar"" that was highly recommended by locals and was so confused when I entered. It was literally a restaurant that just happened to have a bar serving drinks.

**Out of town trips:** In Chicago I really liked heading over to the Michigan beaches, Milwaukee for the day, or Wisconsin for some outdoor fun. In Dallas there really isn't a lot to do within a 2-3hr drive unless you like small Texas towns.

**Outdoor activities:** Chicago isn't the best outdoorsy city but it beats anything in Dallas which is probably one of the worst cities in the US for outdoor activities. People don't even leave their windows open because it's either too hot, too cold, or raining. I love camping and it's very hard to camp in Texas as almost all of the state is privately owned land. We don't have that many state parks and the ones closest to metro areas are always full on the weekends. 

**Politics:** For me this is a wash. If you are more left leaning, Texas is one of the worst states to live in because of how overly vocal and conservative the state officials are. But I wouldn't say that Chicago politics are any less toxic.

**People:** We always hear negative things about Texas on the news but I don't think that represents people who live here. I always find Texans to be very friendly and nice.

**Race relations:** This one is so awkward to discuss but it's something I noticed almost immediately after moving to Dallas. Chicago is a very segregated city and black, white, Hispanic, and Asian people seem to live totally separate lives. And the interactions between races, especially between black and white people felt very constrained. For some reason, I felt like black people in Chicago were hostile to non-black people and many non-black people were uncomfortable being around black people. In Dallas, I witness no such awkwardness. 

**Food:** The Chicago food scene is in general, better than Dallas but there are some areas where Dallas comes ahead. BBQ and Asian food is better quality and more readily available in Dallas. And surprisingly I find the tacos to be better in Chicago. In Dallas, most of the taco places are more TexMex and finding a taco place that's similar to Mexico City style isn't easy.

What to do when you are being harassed and followed on the street by a homeless person?,"I'm from NYC, and for whatever reason, I've never had to deal with this before. My experience so far is that homeless/beggars are more aggressive in Chicago than in NYC. I've only lived here for a month and I've already had a few experiences with hostile people on the streets.

Last night, a man in tattered clothes on a bike was following me down Halsted in Lakeview, harassing me for not responding. Eventually, I starting trying to reason with him because he was growing increasingly confrontational, and I was afraid that he would attack or rob me if I didn't acknowledge him. He told me in the south side I would've been shot dead in the street for ignoring someone.
 
I almost called 911 as he was following me, but I didn't feel safe doing that either because he was so in my personal space that I didn't have time to privately call, and I thought it could trigger him. I actually was able to reason with him. For the future though, what is a good tactic for dealing with aggressive homeless people on the streets?

I think I mostly hang out in relatively safe areas, and I'm also not exactly small/frail so I didn't think this would be an issue moving here. If he had a weapon on him (and I never did find that out) I have trouble imagining what I would've been able to do if he was completely unreasonable.

Avondale/Logan Square - Stray/lost dog spotted,"Hi everyone - not sure if this is the correct way or place to do this, but the situation breaks my heart. Two nights ago my brother in law slammed on the breaks on Belmont and Drake to avoid hitting a stray/lost dog. We followed the dog for a couple blocks trying to get to it, offering it potato chips (it's all we had in the car), attempting to call it while not scaring him, but he/she was still very scared and very fast and got away. This morning a friend spotted the same dog near Belmont and Irene but also could not get to it in time. It was dark so the only description I really have is that it appeared to be a small/medium sized dog, dark wiry hair, long tail, shorter skinny legs, a little mangy. It looked to be a terrier or some kind perhaps. It didn't look to be hurt as it was running/walking just fine. I also couldn't tell if there was a collar or not.
I am just asking everyone to please keep an eye out for this dog, and any stray or lost animal really, and to please try to offer it help if you can. I realize that there are hundreds of lost/stray animals everywhere that also need help, but this one in particular just really got to me because we were so close to being able to help it and we couldn't.

Why don't people in this city care about police reform?,"I lived a block away from a police station on the north side for 25 years so I had multiple issues with police officers just because I happen to live in such close proximity to the police station and be outdoors.

A sampling in no particular order:

1) I was riding my bicycle at night and out of nowhere a speeding police car with its lights off intentionally sped into me to knock me off the road, throwing my body hard onto the cement curve.  The officer shone a flood light into my eyes, said they thought I was someone else, and sped away.  

2) I took the lakefront bike path to my bank job downtown for over two decades whenever it was warm enough outside.  One night on the way home the path was blocked by a police officer who told me to turn around.  When I asked what was going on the officer pulled his gun out of its holster and aimed it at my head.  He was fat and in his 50's and his face was bright red like a cartoon character with steam coming out of his ears which would have been funny if this crazy fuck wasn't pointing a loaded gun at my head.  His partner appeared out of nowhere, put his hands on his partner's gun hand, moved it to the side, apologized, and told me to just leave. Right now.

3) In the early 00's my stepfather had moved to Rogers Park a few miles away from me without my knowledge (we were not close) and was found dead in his apartment from smoke inhalation.  I found out about it from a friend who saw it on the news and called me at work.  I met his second ex-wife (who I knew nothing about because I hadn't seen my stepfather in more than a decade) at the wake and she wanted to have lunch with me which we did about a week later.  She told me that he had called her two days before his death completely panicked because he said someone was going to kill him.  She contacted CPD officers multiple times but they refused to take her statement and immediately closed my stepfather's case as an accidental death.

4) When my car was parked on the street across the street from the police station it was broken into.  The window was smashed, tape deak stolen, etc.  The desk sergeant at the police station refused to let me file a police report.

5) In 2012 while I was driving in the afternoon on Rogers which is a narrow street in Rogers Park that runs along the Metra train tracks a car sped out of an alley and drove straight into the front of my car.  I expected the driver to get out of his RV but instead he put his vehicle in reverse and sped away driving backwards at a very high speed.  I pursued him for about 4 blocks when he nearly ran over a young mother pushing a stroller and then I decided it was too dangerous and let him drive away.  But my smartphone was in a mount on the car window so I was able to get multiple photographs of the front of his vehicle including a clear view of his license plate.  I printed out the pictures, brought them into the police station about an hour later and again the on duty desk sergeant refused to let me file a police report.  When I asked why he said he didn't need to give me a reason and that if I didn't leave he would have me arrested for disturbing the peace (I was completely calm and never raised my voice because I know better than to give a CPD officer an excuse to beat me up or arrest me).  Charging people with disturbing the peace is the standard thing that CPD officers do when they want to arrest someone who isn't doing anything illegal.  If you question a CPD officer's conduct or irritate them they will inevitably arrest you for disturbing the peace or threaten to arrest you for disturbing the peace.  

6) My wallet was stolen by a pick pocket on the CTA Redline during rush hour when the car was so packed you could barely move because the CTA had run the three previous trains express past the stop I was at.  I tried to report the theft but the desk sergeant refused to allow me to file a police report.

7) About a month later I received statements from a bunch of stores where the person who stole my wallet had opened instant credit accounts.  I called all of the cards and told them I hadn't opened the accounts and was told by one that I needed to go to the police station, file a report number, and give it to them which I was thrilled about, obviously, given my previous experiences trying to file police reports in Chicago.

The desk sergeant this time was a female rookie officer but they had apparently schooled her on the fact that she wasn't supposed to accept police reports.  When I told her the credit company said they needed a report number she said no.  When I asked why she said I couldn't prove that I hadn't opened the accounts myself --which I'm pretty sure isn't a prerequisite for trying to report a crime in other cities.  She threatened to have me arrested for disturbing the peace if I didn't leave the station immediately.  I left her desk but stopped on my way to the door, made a speakerphone call to the creditor telling them they said I needed a police report but the police wouldn't let me file one so what was I supposed to do?  The desk sergeant let me file a police report.

I have a friend who does alarm installs and has a company owned van with power tools and ladders in the back.  At least once a year everyone on a job gets their van broken into at least once and some tools are stolen.  The company insists that the employees file a police report before reporting to their next job but if the break-in happened in Chicago successfully filing a police report can take half of the work day because they have to keep going to different area police stations until they find someone working who will let them file a police report.

When Jodi Weiss was police commander one of his most important reforms involved staffing.  Under the longtime system in Chicago officers are allowed to choose where they work based on seniority and the same number of officers are assigned to high crime areas as neighborhoods with barely any crime.  The latter makes no sense in terms of dealing with crime and the former results in officers with the least amount of experience and training always working in the areas with the most crime.

Jody Weiss decided that officers should be assigned where they were needed rather than where they wanted so there would actually be experienced officers working in high crime areas.  He also adjusted staffing so high crime areas were assigned more officers than low crime areas and created a roving force of officers who instead of being assigned to a specific precinct would be moved into different areas where crime was spiking.

Daley had hired Jody Weiss away from the FBI where he worked for 23 years and worked as the Deputy Assistant to the FBI Chief and as the head of the Philadelphia Field Office which is one of the largest in the country.  Weiss was highly regarded, knew what he was doing, and the CPD Union absolutely hated him.

They were especially incensed that veteran officers were being forced to work in high crime areas and risk their lives instead of being allowed to just sit in their cars eating donuts in low crime neighborhoods.  

Rahm Emanuel promised that Jody Weiss would go if the CPD Union supported his mayoral candidacy after Daley's retirement.  The union got to hand pick his successor and within 6 months the crime rate and murder rates in Chicago both exploded.

Chicago has a high crime rate because we have an absolutely terrible police force that refuses to do their jobs --not because mayors aren't tough on crime.  It's sad that so many people in the city actually buy that bullshit and don't understand what's really going on.

Keep in mind that Daley was corrupt as hell--he was about as far from being a reform politician as you could possibly get but the level of corruption and dysfunction at the CPD was too much even for him to stomach which is why he brought in Jody Weiss to try and fix the department.

In 2018 the CPD was placed under Federal Supervision because of corruption and civil rights violations (which was what Daley had been trying to avoid) and signed a Consent Decree that was supposed to create external oversight and enact multiple reforms and even that has done nothing to reform the Chicago Police Department.  Electing John Catanzara who was so openly corrupt that three consecutive police commanders tried to have him removed from the force and who had been stripped of his police powers as the head of the Union sent a very clear message about the state of reform at the CPD to anyone who bothered to pay attention.",AskChicago,114,1741709003.0,197,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1j8u8rz/why_dont_people_in_this_city_care_about_police/,"Why don't people in this city care about police reform?

Keep in mind that Daley was corrupt as hell--he was about as far from being a reform politician as you could possibly get but the level of corruption and dysfunction at the CPD was too much even for him to stomach which is why he brought in Jody Weiss to try and fix the department.

In 2018 the CPD was placed under Federal Supervision because of corruption and civil rights violations (which was what Daley had been trying to avoid) and signed a Consent Decree that was supposed to create external oversight and enact multiple reforms and even that has done nothing to reform the Chicago Police Department.  Electing John Catanzara who was so openly corrupt that three consecutive police commanders tried to have him removed from the force and who had been stripped of his police powers as the head of the Union sent a very clear message about the state of reform at the CPD to anyone who bothered to pay attention.",['Rogers Park'],"['avoid', 'dangerous', 'threatened', 'gun']",4,Negative/Fear,0.891
Editorial: City Council should reject proposed $1.25M settlement in Dexter Reed police shooting,"The City Council should not approve the proposed $1.25 million settlement to the survivors of Dexter Reed, shot dead last March by Chicago police after he opened fire on them.

This is not to say that all the actions surrounding the traffic stop of the 26-year-old Reed in Humboldt Park on that fateful day were appropriate and shouldn’t be second-guessed. A group of five officers, dressed not in uniform but in tactical clothing and gear, surrounded Reed’s car for reasons that remain unclear (and are still under investigation).

Ordered to get out of his car, Reed refused and instead rolled up his darkly tinted windows. The situation escalated quickly, with Reed shooting at the officers from inside his car and hitting one (thankfully not fatally). Officers opened fire in return, and Reed staggered out of his car and was shot to death.

The Civilian Office of Police Accountability, the agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct and recommends disciplinary action, released the horrifying video within a few weeks. Andrea Kersten, COPA’s chief administrator, then went on an ill-advised media tour in which she shared preliminary conclusions she’d drawn about what the officers had done wrong.

Reed’s family used much of the information Kersten provided in advance of completion of COPA’s investigation in the wrongful-death lawsuit they filed just a few months later. And now here we are, with a proposed settlement readied for council approval and COPA’s probe still not complete! The Finance Committee is scheduled to consider the matter Monday.

Much of the initial criticism of the cops focused on the number of shots they fired in rapid fashion — 96 bullets in 41 seconds, as numerous headlines trumpeted. But the family’s attorney now emphasizes the circumstances of the traffic stop itself, suggesting that an allegedly improper pretext for stopping Reed would have been the plaintiffs’ primary argument in favor of liability.

There are — and have been — reasonable debates to have about the Chicago Police Department’s use of pretextual stops (pulling over cars for minor infractions as a means to search for drugs, guns or both) in neighborhoods populated mainly by minorities. On this subject, CPD Superintendent Larry Snelling has agreed with the critics, at least in part, and has de-emphasized and reduced the number of such stops.

But, even if a stop isn’t justified, we all should be able to agree that police are within their rights to shoot back if someone they’ve pulled over shoots at them first. Police work in Chicago is extraordinarily hazardous duty in a city beset with firearms, many of which are illegally converted via cheap, easily obtainable gadgets into the equivalent of a machine gun.

Paying an excessively large settlement to the survivors of those killed after violently attacking cops sends a few unmistakable messages. In the more immediate sense, the message sent to the officers involved in the Reed shooting, who remain suspended while they await the outcome of COPA’s investigation and the departmental response, is that the city already considers them responsible. That’s inappropriate.

But, more broadly, the message delivered to all the other men and women on our streets putting their lives in jeopardy each day to try to make Chicago safer is that they put their livelihoods and reputations at risk when they use deadly force to protect themselves against someone shooting at them.

In November, Officer Enrique Martinez, responding to a call for help on the South Side, was shot to death from inside a car he had approached. Martinez lost his life in a hail of bullets from one of those illegally converted handguns.

You have to be a cop, or be a loved one of a cop, to understand the bravery required, and the fear that must be overcome, in order to walk up to a car in many Chicago neighborhoods and confront those inside the vehicle. Especially at night, as Martinez had to do.

The argument for settling with Dexter Reed’s family is that paying the costs of defense and risking a judgment might well cost taxpayers considerably more than $1.25 million. That sort of calculation is always a consideration in litigation against those perceived as having deep pockets, whether that’s the nation’s third-largest city or a corporation or a wealthy individual.

But this case strikes us as about more than money. Sometimes a principled stand is in order.

We have a Police Department that appears to be starting to get its footing back after cops were castigated in far too many corners of this city during the reckoning following George Floyd’s murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. We seem to be heading toward an appropriate middle ground between “backing the blue” no matter the facts, which dominated for decades, and the “defund the police” madness that ensued in more recent times. Surely, it’s possible to hold police accountable for wrongdoing or terrible mistakes while also supporting them when they act reasonably in the face of mortal danger.

“Where is our line in the sand?” Ald. Anthony Napolitano, 41st, told the Chicago Sun-Times. “These officers were fired upon. One of them was hit. … You can’t Monday-morning-quarterback that. It’s next to impossible unless you’re gonna put robots on the street.”

When you shoot at police officers, you bear at least most of the responsibility for what happens next. And the next time police shoot and kill someone who shoots first at them, how will the city defend itself from that lawsuit, having capitulated in this one?

Since the mayor’s Law Department isn’t going to do it, the City Council should draw that line in the sand and reject the settlement.",chicago,311,1739117824.0,322,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1ili9ro/editorial_city_council_should_reject_proposed/,"Editorial: City Council should reject proposed $1.25M settlement in Dexter Reed police shooting The City Council should not approve the proposed $1.25 million settlement to the survivors of Dexter Reed, shot dead last March by Chicago police after he opened fire on them.

What's really going on in the South Loop?,"TLDR; Opinions on Sentral, The Cooper or 1000 South Clark? Also, more importantly, what's really going on at Roosevelt Station/nearby area? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. In case it isn't clear, I don't think anything of Chicago besides it's lovely and like any other major city. I just wanted to get a better understanding of what I've read on Reddit and was trying to offset the ridiculous nature of this post with humor!

UPDATE 2.0: **Final update, I promise.** I just wanted to say thanks again–y’all are really kind and reading your experiences has been very helpful. *Thanks for being my grain*s *of salt!* **If any of y’all in the South Loop (or nearby) want some new friends, DM me if you're interested in meeting up. My partner and I don't know anyone in Chicago and are starting from scratch.** Thanks again everyone!

**Background**: My partner and I are moving to Chicago (for work). With that being said, we're pretty stoked about it because we both fell in love with it when we visited a few years ago. We have lived primarily in the NE, specifically NYC (both Manhattan and the Bronx).

**Why the South Loop:** We've looked at a few areas, and we both seem pretty happy with Printer's Row/South Loop. We've read several threads, and we understand it can be a *sleepy* area, and that's fine with us. We have no issue traveling to other areas if we want to go out. We're pretty set with a few solid coffee shops and small businesses. Another reason we're set on it is the proximity to the park and the lake. Being close to green spaces is important to us, and we wanted to be within a quick walking distance.

Cool. Hopefully that answers anyone who might be asking *why* we're looking at this area. **We've found a couple of buildings that have interested us (Sentral, The Cooper, 1000 South Clark), so if you have any personal experiences, please share.**

Otherwise, my main question is this: **I've read that a lot of people love the South Loop, but it seems like even when people have nothing but good things to say... they all still mention Roosevelt station.** Now, we've ridden the NYC subway day and night, we've lived in some sketchy neighborhoods when we were broke college kids, and all of that was... fine. *Sus*, but, ultimately, fine. So, is everyone being dramatic? Have y'all never lived in another major city? Should we be looking elsewhere? Is it just the station–i.e. is it self-contained?–or is it the entire area? I don't even think we'll be taking the train often since we like walking when possible, but clue me in *please (am I going to get murdered? jk)*

I don't want to live somewhere where I'm constantly being harassed or where I'm scared to have my girlfriends/family visit. They're all already up in the air about Chicago being dangerous, and I hate being told ""I told you so."" My partner and I agree that any major city can be dangerous (uh, cue NYC), but are we walking ourselves into some kind of miserable (ahem, dangerous) trap? I seriously cannot get a clear read from everything I've read.

Elderly low-income South Shore apt.: dangerous?,"Sorry for this 3 a.m. rambling post...

I saw on Craigslist Chicago an elderly/disabled 62 and older low-income apartment,  charging 30% of one's income. 

I am very low income, so should qualify. 

From pictures I've seen around various internet sites, the building looks low income -- no surprise there.

But I don't mind spartan, just not dangerous. 

It's at 6900 S. Crandon Ave/Street.  Zip code 60649.  The ad calls it the South Shore neighborhood (or is South Shore an area more than a neighborhood?).

Yes, I've done online searches, and it's far from the Loop and northside by public transit.

Even a CVS or Walgreens seems a mile or more walk, but I think an Aldi is near but no Jewel, Trader Joe's or Whole Foods Market in such a zip code, unsurprising.

Seems kind of close to the Lake and beaches and a cultural center...but still maybe a hassle to regulary access on foot?

Maybe a branch library nearby?

...

I have lived in the Boston area all my adult life and enjoy and appreciate its relatively high quality of living, despite the high cost of rents.

But I might need to relocate to Chicago for a friend, and I've always liked the ""desirable""  parts of Chicago on my two very brief visits, in 1994 and 2011.

I'm a hockey fan, so would cheer for the Blackhawks!  I guess this neighborhhood cheers for the White Sox, not the Cubs?

I am a gay, white, husky male, somewhat strong, but can't really fight well if attacked.  I have a Bachelor's degree, but have done blue collar jobs most of my life. Will I not fit in in this zip code? Maybe not too gay friendly around there?

Oh, I can't afford your north side gay-friendly neighborhoods.

Just stay away from that vicinity, or might be worth it for low rent and to live alone?

Problem is I like to ride the safer parts of Boston subways and trolleys...whether for errands or even fun and relaxation!...of course I encounter some disturbed people, but I can tolerate them if not dangerous. If I nod off in the daytime wnd even nights on the parts of our transit I use, I don't fear my safety.

Yes, I understand I couldn't safely do that in much of Chicago's transit system, at leasf at night.

And I like to stroll the safer neighbors in Boston and nearby...even at night, and I feel comfortable.  

But not sure I could safely walk from the Chicago public transit station or bus stop to this address at night, but daytime should be fine? And I think I read it's not that near an actual subway line but closer to a ""Metra?"" line into downtown?  Hmmm...

Thanks!

"Early 40s/F Fine Art Photographer, visiting Chicago Mid Sept. What should I remove/add/replace from my options?","Hi, Y'all. 

I'm a dark botanical photographer from Montreal, QC. Hoping you can provide some insight on my upcoming trip. I really love all kinds of art and anything weird or obscure, dive bars . I also love creative and delicious food/wine, local beer and a well made cocktail without sweetness.   
  
I'll be traveling solo mid-ish September and have been furiously Googling all the things I'd like to do and now I have the problem of too many things on my list.   
  
I'll be there for 5 days but leave on a Saturday, so I don't have a weekend in the city.  Mostly looking for things to cull from my list based on the following:

Would also love to talk to other artists/fine art photographers/creatives.

 I probably won't be doing late nights with heavy drinking, but would like to see local live acts close to my hostel (near Lincoln Park)

 For the evenings, I would, in large prefer to stay around the Lincoln Park area where I could walk back to my hostel, but if there's a spot I shouldn't miss or that's close to one of the restaurants on my list, I'm open.

These are the places/touristy stuff/shopping I have so far. Are there any things that I might have missed or should skip? 

Also, for any photographers, should I bother bringing a wide angle lens based on street configurations/architectural detail etc or will I be okay with a 55-250mm f/4-5.6? 

Based on the above, will I feel uncomfortable at any of the bars/restaurants on my list having a drink/dining alone?

I'm a dark botanical photographer from Montreal, QC. Hoping you can provide some insight on my upcoming trip. I really love all kinds of art and anything weird or obscure, dive bars . I also love creative and delicious food/wine, local beer and a well made cocktail without sweetness.

open letter from a chicago gang member/ama,"this is written poorly so bear with me if your interested

what's up yall....i'm gonna start this off with some info upon myself, i found reddit a couple months back in the summer when i was looking up fl studio techniques (/r/flstudio) and i've been really amused by the diversity and structure of this site, i spend alot of my time on here learning about things i'd otherwise be unfamiliar with but i typically stick to /r/makinghiphop /r/hiphopheads /r/islam /r/trees and /r/iama

i'm from the south woodlawn area of chicago, a specific block known as the 'mecca' in the vicinity of marquette and blackstone (rightfully named) down the block from mt. carmel high/hyde park high/jackson park. this area has been strictly black p stone since the 70s....some of my kinfolk are blood related to the honorable likes of chief eugene hairston, melvin bailey, and   lamar bell.

i'd like to consider the blackstones among the wiser more righteous gangs in the land but this varies quite much.....you have sets like mine called the mecca.....then you got sets that pride themselves by the name terrortown or slaughtertown so you can use your imagination with that shit. original black p. stone ranger doctrine advises against unneccasary violence, promotes moorish identity and promotes reflection of truth, justice and freedom.

heres where my open letter comes in place: things are different my friends, this is a new era of chicago gangsterism. in the 90's violence occured over pride, money, identity, essentially always had a (often very arguable) purpose......nowadays that doesn't matter. these young cats (15-21) get to listening to /r/drillandbop and get gun happy. i've seen cats shoot each other over miniscule amounts of money. seen cottage grove cats shoot irrelevant humboldt park cats for bearing different flags (foolishness). my advice to you all are if you see gang activity avoid it. i see alot of these young hipster that get to gentrifying thinking shit is sweet, trying to take pictures, be friendly etc etc.....a few months back i had a white guy walk up to me at the walgreens on 67th and get real friendly ""are you a vice lord? have you ever killed somebody? do you sell crack?"".....if that was somebody 5 years younger then me that might have ended badly. i read a book a while back called gang leader for a day, some of y'all might be familiar with that literature......that shit is a fairy tale, especially in this era of chief keefs, king yellas, etc etc...don't try that shit. also, white people, dont try buying drugs from people clearly affiliated with gangs, thats how you get mugged. if you try buying drugs off an open market (without prior communication/from a stranger) i reccomend only spending half of what you intend, then if the first transaction is smooth, continue at your discretion. if there are any youngins that go to mount carmel.....don't walk south.....dont try and hang out at the restaraunts and what not when you should be in school or after dark. its atleast 10 highschool kids in my neighborhood that don't acquire knowledge at hyde park like they should....back in the late 90's i MYSELF used to have fun with you cats.....imagine what my youngins would do. mind your own business, enjoy yourself and chicago is the most beautiful city in america, snow or not.

i say all this because my intent is to promote positivity and peace, the reddit community is very unique and even if you weren't i believe each individual on here serves a purpose, don't let some young kids power trip or thirst for money disrupt that.

now i encourage you to AMAa (ask me almost anything), but bear in mind what i admire about reddit is its open and diverse community, if i, a damn gang member can fly on this site, i imagine 10 off-duty CPD deputies are too, so be realistic with your questions.

proof: if a moderator wishes i can send him pictures or write him portions of the black p. stone doctrine privately. i will NOT send pictures of my face, friends faces; street signs; anything remotely identifying myself or my location, or anything else incriminating or subject to gang injuctions

How big of an issue is catcalling and sexual harassment?,"Hi everyone!  I am 20 (F) and from London. I'm planning to solo travel to Chicago sometime between late August and early September. After learning about the city, the architecture, cultural diversity and history, I'm excited to visit. I'm 100% sure I'd like to go and will be booking a flight soon. I'll be staying either in Lincoln Park, River North or Lakeview. 

Coming from a major city, I do experience catcalling regularly or men trying to talk to me particularly during the summer. I asked ChatGPT (I know I know ;-;) and it said that catcalling in Chicago is 'rare' and 'socially frowned upon' and only really 'very late at night, near busy transit hubs, if someone is drunk. And even then, it's usually mild and short'. I started researching and came across a few posts on the matter on this sub from years ago that greatly contradict this.

Currently, how prominent is catcalling within Chicago and how likely am I to experience it? I'm worried about this factor because in my home city it is a constant issue, I have really bad anxiety, am very shy and  have a very soft quiet voice that causes men to not take no for an answer. I don't want to endanger myself alone in another country. Is it necessary for me to carry pepper spray?

As women, it is incredibly uncomfortable and anxiety inducing to have to deal with this. :( Is it predominantly words or does it often escalate into following and touching?

Is Edgewater cool late at night?,"Yes.. another post about safety.

I was in a real bind and running out of time when I was doing my apartment search and without doing much research, I signed a lease in Edgewater on the SW corner of Kenmore &amp; Glenlake. I have been doing some research on the area, just trying to see what cool and fun stuff might be over there, when I came across a map of gang territories and saw that my apartment is within a small block that apparently has gang activity in it.

Anyways, I know that if I mind my business I should be fine. I am curious though- should I be at all worried? I can't help but to feel uneasy that I picked one of the 2 blocks in Edgewater that have gang activity. I honestly can't find much recent information about Edgewater in general online, I take it that's because it's a relatively quiet place with not much going on. I did see lots of storefronts were abandoned, but that doesn't bother me really.

A lot of what I read online says that east of broadway can be dodgy, but a lot of those posts are 3-10 years old. I am not really sure what to expect and I'm a bit uneasy about it, since I am a 120lb 5'5"" white gay male and I will have to take the redline back home around 130-2am 1 day per week, and it seems like there isn't really a bus service that compliments the red line late at night all the way to edgewater so I'm going to be stuck taking the red line.

In any event, I am a 6 minute walk from either the Thorndale or Granville station. For someone coming home at 1-2am on saturdays, which station is safest and what is my best route to avoid any gang activity or bad actors? It's such a quick walk but of course anything can happen between the red line and my home. I hate to ask another safety question in this subreddit but it's kind of sitting at the back of my mind, as someone who hasn't lived in Chicago before. I am feeling some slight regret on my decision(mostly because it's so far from everything) but would love some positive reinforcement from anyone who might live in the neighborhood. 

Thanks in advance :)",AskChicago,17,1705603754.0,51,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/199xh8s/is_edgewater_cool_late_at_night/,"Is Edgewater cool late at night? Yes.. another post about safety.

Just a reminder to stay vigilant and beware of scammers,"I feel like such a dumbass right now. I thought I've lived here long enough to avoid this type of thing but apparently not. Last night I was scammed, and there were a million red flags I should have noticed but didn't.

I was in the west loop area doing food deliveries, and a lady approached me. She was in tears and panicking, which was probably why I let my guard down. Also, I hate to admit it, but I also let my guard down because she was a young white woman, so her story seemed more believable.

She told me a story about how she lived far away, and she couldn't drive home because her friend was drunk. Red flag number one, she seemed perfectly sober so she could have driven. Also, her friend was nowhere to be seen. Nor was the taxi. 

She gave me her phone number so I could contact her, which really means nothing because she's obviously not replying to texts or calls. It was probably a throwaway number anyway. 

She said that the taxi required a cash deposit because she was traveling over thirty miles. Red flag number two, why would a taxi require cash if they accept cards?

I told her I didn't have any cash on me, which was true. She immediately pointed to the shop across the street that had an ATM sign. Red flag number three, she knew where the ATM was without hesitation.

She followed me inside, I used the ATM, of course it only gave multiples of 20, and she said the cash deposit was $65. Red flag number four, that's such an arbitrary number. And why couldn't she just withdraw the cash herself if she actually had money? Anyway, I withdrew $80 plus a $2 ATM fee. 

I gave her the cash, she said thank you, I saved her life, hugged me, the whole shebang, and I hopped on the L and we went our own ways.

The whole ordeal was FAST, so I wasn't processing things properly. I was also tired from work, plus it was dark and cold out. It wasn't until I sat down on the train and took a breath that I realized what really happened.

Moral of the story, don't be an idiot like me. Don't give money to strangers, ever, unless you're fully prepared to never get it back. Even if they're the nicest person in the worst situation, always offer to help some other way, or just don't help at all. You're not obligated to be a hero to everyone.

Public Safety - Please Be Careful,"Last night I received a message from work that someone in their building had been robbed by two people in teens/early twenties wearing black ski masks. This happened in Ravenswood on 10/26 two blocks west of 4606 N. Hermitage. I clocked it but because I was in Edgewater I didn’t think too much about it.

At 2am I turned onto W Early Ave that meets Magnolia Ave in Edgewater right off of Broadway. As I turned I saw a person wearing all black, a ski mask/balaclava, riding their bike on the sidewalk, actively looking at peoples homes. I made eye contact with him while I was slowing down to find parking.

Then he slowed down and watched me. Something in me felt like this was a dangerous person and I sped up and rounded the corner. As I did that I could see them pedaling to follow me. 

I called 911 to report the suspicious activity and met up with police later who acknowledged they were trying to find this particular person/people. There were no discernible descriptions about the person other than their clothing and they seemed to carry themselves like a young person: late teens/early 20’s. That and the fact that they were actively casing peoples homes.

"Chicago, I need advice about terrible apartment complex","My little sister moved into her first apartment 1 month ago in Andersonville (corner of Summerdale and Damen). Found and paid for it all on her own. Unfortunately, when I helped her moved in I realized that the building was going to be problematic. 

1. The whole place smelled like cigarettes and cats (Neither are allowed)
2. The elevator was last inspected in 1994
3. One of the tenants informed us that there is a roach problem that the landlord refuses to take care of. 
4. None of the buzzers work on the front door, all tenants (40+ units) are unable to receive packages of any kind because of this

My little sister is so positive, she really tried to make the best of it all. Her air conditioners were broken upon moving in and he is being really stubborn about fixing them. We harassed him to take care of the roaches, finally he had somebody spray some raid in the unit. But it is obvious that the building is completely infested, a spray bottle wont do the trick.

I am not sure what to do next, I know that she can move but there are 40 other people in this building that live in awful conditions because of this asshole landlord. He is an old german guy who is super stubborn. I was thinking about setting up a meeting with the alderman. The roaches are really a health hazard and the out of date building inspections scare me. A lot of people who live in the building are immigrants who are afraid to stand up to the landlord. I am not afraid but I am not sure what to do next aside from having her move out. 

Reddit, I am ready to go into battle with this guy. Do you have any advice/help for me at all? 

TL;DR - Sister lives in a building with cockroaches, broken buzzers and sketchy elevators. Landlord refuses to fix. I want to solve this without having to move.

Looking for a film title shot in Chicago with a scene of jumping from the Loop onto (possibly an open) car...,"Hi there, Chicago people!

I am looking for a film title, shot in Chicago for a very long time (over five years and longer).

- Basic genre of the film is action/crime. No comedy component at all.

- It was shot in color, in English.

- Most of the scenes are in Chicago.

- The main character chases the criminal or is chased by him on the Loop's railroad, jumping onto a (possibly open) car on the ground, which is driven by the criminal or another criminal (in the case he is chased by).

- I do not remember if the main character walks from a station along the railroad or he is at first on a train and then jumps onto the railroad while the train is running.

- The type of main character is Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis (these two are just an example), and such, who is action star and Caucasian. Perhaps he may be an Asian, like Jackie Chan. He is the chaser, not the one to be chased in general.

- The film was shot in late 80s and early 90s. Definitely before 2000. Perhaps shot in early 80s, but not before that.

- I watched this film on TV in late 90s, definitely before 2000.

- It could be not related to Chicago, in case it was shot in Seattle (monorail), Miami
or Canada (elevated railway).

- I watched this film on TV definitely before 2000.

- Being a fan, I have checked all Steven Seagal's films and none of them matches.

Code of Silence (85), Red Heat (88), Rapid Fire (92), Running Scared (86), Assasins (95), Cobra (86), The Fugitive (93), Priamal Fear (96), Chain Reaction (96), Jackal (97), U.S. Marshals (98), Mercury Rising (98), The Negotiator (98), Bad Boys (95), Above the Law (88), Excessive Force (93), Risky Business (83), High Fidelity (00), About Last Night (86), Gladiator (92), Adventures in Babysitting (87), Planes, Trains, &amp; Automobiles (87), Flatliners (90), Medium Cool (69), Next of Kin (89)
(some of them found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_set_in_Chicago,_Illinois

Jackal as the whole tone most fits the one, but there is no such scene of jumping from the Loop.

I was thinking Pilsen or Chinatown, (the loop is the only part I know fairly well, so I don't think I would enjoy it) any recommendations? Preferably within walking distance of an L stop. 

Maybe the better question is what neighborhoods to avoid at all costs?

Best Friend Was Violently Mugged @ Halsted &amp; Clark Last Night: Warning and Questions,"My best friend is a restaurant manager downtown that regularly gets out of work after 2am. Last night he was walking from the Belmont Red Line to his home near Clark and Diversey, walking down Clark to where it meets Halsted, near the shopping plaza with DSW. An SUV did a u-turn, pulled up beside him and 2 Latino men got out of the car, one choked him against the brick wall while the other grabbed his wrists and proceded to hold him in some kind of wrestling hold while the choker took his briefcase and searched his pockets for his wallet. They then hit him and took off in the SUV.

My friend immediately called the police and made a police report. He gave them the license plate #, which came back to a completely different car (probably stolen plates). 

He is now going to talk to some of the stores to see if they have video surveillance of what happened.

Just wanted to warn everyone because I feel guilty bragging about how safe I feel in Lakeview in another post. My friend was completely sober and walking on a busy street in front of a huge shopping mall and this happened to him. Granted it was almost 3am and he was in a suit, which probably made him stand out as a target, but still :-( Also, if anyone has any advice for dealing with this, it would be much appreciated. All credit cards are cancelled.

Thanks for reading all that and STAY SAFE!



Edit: UPDATE- Someone just called his job (presumably off one of his business cards) and he was put in touch with ""Junior"" who lives on the far south side and ""found his stuff"". I told him to have him meet him at an el stop and to call the police and have them present. Not sure what's going to happen with that...hopefully he can get his stuff back. I will keep you posted, Reddit!


Edit: UPDATE 2- First off, thank you to everyone who took the time to read this and offer advice. My friend is still playing phone tag with the person who ""found his briefcase"". He works 80 hours/week, so he doesn't really have time at the moment (especially the weekend) to deal with it but he will hopefully be meeting up with him tomorrow on his day off.

A few important points I would like to address from all the comments:

- I believe in conceal and carry. I am mad at everyone downvoting the people who are making valid points regarding CCW. I was raised in a police officer family and I know for a fact that the police support CCW because they know that the thugs that are robbing people in the nice neighborhoods are not using guns. And if they do, they are not loaded and just for intimidation. Gangbangers may be stupid in a lot of senses, but they are not trying to get life sentences to steal an iPhone. The guys with guns are staying in their own neighborhoods and shooting rival gangbangers. 
I think the licensing process should be ultra strict and require extensive training. Ideally, I would love to live in a society that had no guns...like pretty much every other first world country. But that is not the reality we live in.

- ""If I am related to so many police, why can't I help my friend more?"" In case you're asking that, the answer is that without an actual license plate, they can't do anything. Because his phone wasn't taken, the total value of stuff stolen was under $100 and he didn't require any medical attention. There really isn't much that they can do.

- Things that my friend can do to prevent this from happening again: Bring a change of clothes to work so that he isn't coming home late in a nice suit. NOT walk around listening to music on his headphones late at night so that he is more aware of his surroundings. Keep his money/credit cards/id in a separate clip and keep a wallet that is for holding business cards and his Jewel preferred card and coupons/other crap that can be easily replaced. Get some mace. For the record, pepper spray and mace are 2 different things and mace is illegal in Cook County, but as I already said, the police won't arrest you for using mace against an attacker. 


Again, I am glad so many people took the time to read this. My intention was to make everyone aware that with summer comes a huge spike in crime. And the ONLY thing that is going to solve this is to get more police on the streets. Please don't blame the CPD. They are extremely over-worked. Blame our asshole mayor and all of our asshole aldermen for taking all the money from the highest taxed city in the country and misappropriating the funds. We don't need a new fucking megaplex for DePaul basketball. We need more police on the streets.

Advice after Aug. robbery in Bucktown? To move or not to move...,"Hello! I'm coming to this sub for a bit of expert advice. I've been living in Chicago for a little over a year - first in Ukrainian Village (approx. Western + Iowa) for a year and moved to Bucktown in mid-July for a better commute and more safety. I'm from the East Coast and lived near Boston, MA for \~10 years before moving here for work. I've always tried to use street smarts and be vigilant but unfortunately, while my dad was visiting me from out of town, we experienced an armed robbery near my apartment in August. They took my wallet and I was unharmed but my dad was hit with the gun and beat up. It was terrifying. The police are involved but it's unlikely they'll find the perpetrators because there was little evidence left behind and we can't remember their faces plus there's no camera footage.

I've had a hard time getting back to normal life since then, especially because the crime surge has continued. I have a good support network but I don't feel safe going anywhere and I have intense anxiety about anyone visiting me. I'm on the edge of packing up and quitting Chicago. Before this, I was building a little life here. I sang in a chorus, went to art groups/events, hung out with friends, and went to networking things, explored the city, etc. but now none of that feels safe.

How do I get less anxious living in south Chicago for the first time?,"I just moved to Chicago (south Hyde Park/Woodlawn area) with some college friends, I wanted to be farther up north but they set a firm budget and time limit for apartments and ended up here. The apartment itself is fine, but I'm not really comfortable with the city yet.

This is my first apartment and I've been pretty sheltered so far, living in suburbs with my family or college dorms (and rarely venturing off campus). In theory, I really want to get out and explore new things in the big city, but I'm also very anxious and paranoid especially hearing lots of people talk about crime rates and such.

Especially in the area we're in, I've heard lots of people online say things like 'don't go south of 61st' or '63rd street is dangerous' or etc. I'm also a short, young, autistic woman, so I feel like my street smarts are not the best and feel vulnerable. Plus it feels weird being like one of the very few of white people I've seen in the area because I don't like standing out much.

So far, I've taken the 63rd bus and the red line from there to downtown and back (roommate showed me the route there but I had to go back alone). Walking downtown around Jackson and such was ok enough (Idk I only wandered a couple blocks around where I needed to be), but I felt pretty nervous at the bus stops and on the red line. I also walked to the Jewel on Cottage Grove with roommates once.

An uptick in crime on East Division street- Join me in emailing Brian Hopkins?,"In the past few months, there’s been a major rise in crime along East Division Street, especially between State and Lake Shore Drive. With all the congestion near Dearborn and State, more people are walking or calling Ubers home around Astor &amp; Division — and that area has turned into a hotspot for robberies and assaults. Criminals are clearly targeting people who are walking alone or leaving bars.

My boyfriend was recently the victim of an attempted robbery at 11:30 PM , not even that late for a weekend. It’s unacceptable that we can’t feel safe walking in our own neighborhood. I sent the following message to Alderman Brian Hopkins and encourage others to do the same or speak out:

Subject: Urgent Request for Increased Security on East Division Street

Dear Alderman Hopkins,

I’m writing as a concerned resident of the Gold Coast neighborhood regarding the alarming spike in crime along East Division Street, particularly between State Street and Lake Shore Drive.

Since the recent openings of the Galleria Club and Gold Coast Social, our neighborhood has experienced a troubling increase in robberies, assaults, and even murders. What was once a quiet and safe residential area has become unrecognizable—and unsafe.

It is unacceptable that residents no longer feel safe walking in their own neighborhood. I am asking you to take immediate action by: •	Increasing the presence of police or private security patrols during evening and late-night hours •	Implementing a curfew or stricter enforcement of loitering and noise ordinances for nightlife venues •	Re-evaluating the licenses and community impact of establishments contributing to this unsafe environment

I hope you will treat this issue with the urgency it deserves before further harm is done. We need leadership that protects residents and restores peace to our community.

"If I have the money to live elsewhere, would moving to EGP be a bad idea?","Specifically the 3000 W block of Warren?

First Time in the US. Visiting Chicago (Aug 30–Sept 6) – Itinerary + Questions. Can you please share tips and help with my questions?,"Hey everyone!

I’ll be traveling to Chicago from Aug 30 to Sept 6 for business meetings and workshops through my company. This will be my first-ever US trip, and I had options to choose between Philadelphia, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Orlando. I was already leaning toward Chicago, and thanks to some helpful folks on r/USTravel my decision got reinforced.

I’ll arrive at ORD on Sat, Aug 30 at 4 PM local time. I should have some time to explore that evening (I’m pretty active, so I think I’ll be fine). I’ll then have all of Sunday and Labor Day (Mon, Sept 1) to explore, plus evenings free after 5:30 PM from Tue–Fri.

After my business trip, I plan to fly from Chicago to NYC on the morning of Sept 6 to spend 3 nights there before heading back to India on Sept 9.

About Me
	
•	M33, based in India (this will be my 2nd international trip – first was London last year for 8 days).
	
•	Interests → art, museums, science, tech, landscapes, parks. Slightly afraid of heights, so might skip observation decks unless they’re absolutely worth it.
	
•	Food → love good food &amp; beer. I don’t eat beef/pork but wouldn’t mind trying if the dish is really good.

	
•	Work will cover my stay, food/drinks, and cabs till Sept 6 (likely staying downtown, hotel TBD). All sightseeing will be out of pocket.

⸻

Planned Itinerary

📅 Sat, Aug 30 (Evening)
• Stroll along Chicago Riverwalk → Dinner

📅 Sun, Aug 31
• Millennium Park
• Art Institute of Chicago
• Architecture River Cruise
• Maggie Daley Park / Grant Park
• Museum of Science and Industry

📅 Mon, Sept 1 (Labor Day) – hoping these places are open
• Navy Pier
• Shedd Aquarium
• Adler Planetarium
• Field Museum
• Riverwalk &amp; Magnificent Mile
• Lincoln Park Zoo

📅 Tue–Fri (Sept 2–5 evenings)
• Free after work (~5:30 PM). Would love suggestions on what to do in evenings!

Questions I’d Love Help With:
	
1.	Any areas I should avoid as a foreigner, especially at night?
	
2.	Is it safe to be out till 11 PM–12 AM on Sunday/Monday nights?
	
3.	Weather looks pleasant—planning to bring just a light jacket. Should I pack anything extra?
	
4.	Tipping – I really don’t want to under-tip or offend anyone. For a $50 dinner, what’s a fair tip?
	
5.	Is CityPASS worth it, or is it cheaper to pay for each attraction separately?
	
6.	For my ORD → JFK flight on Sept 6, I’ll have 2 medium trolley bags, 1 cabin bag, and a backpack – how much extra should I expect to pay for baggage?
	
7.	Any must-try dishes, local specialties, or restaurants/bars you’d recommend?

Is Roseland/109th and South Wabash a dangerous area?,"Hey guys, so I'm from out of State, but I love Chicago, it's my favorite city in the world. I'm going to be visiting again in a few months with some friends and I've always wondered about this specific area. My  great-great grandparents owned a house here in the 1890s/early 1900s (between 109th and 110th on South Wabash, in the Roseland community area) and I've thought before about driving past the house just to see it. I'm not planning on loitering or knocking on the door or taking pictures or anything like that, just a quick drive past to see the current exterior. 

Now I know Roseland and the surrounding streets are not necessarily the safest in the city. WikiTravel says to avoid the so-called ""Wild 100s"" and my grandfather once asked a friend in Chicago who was a police officer about the area, and he said he wouldn't go down there without backup. Yet Roseland (at least on the crime maps of the community areas) isn't one of the absolute worst in the city, right?

I'm just wondering if this is a super bad area and a place to stay away from at all costs, or is it probably just fine to drive through and not loiter around? I'm of course not from Chicago, so who better to ask then actual Chicagoans?

- Not a food desert...
- Close to some sort of downtown
- I need to be at work everyday **at 5:00am**, so traffic shouldn't be an issue.
- I have no problem driving **20-30 minutes** that time of the day.
- **Budget:** $1000, for a 1-BR.

I'm trying to learn as much as possible on transit before I go there because like I said when I go that means a job already accepted me so I'd like to atleast be in the ballpark of knowing so I can figure it out from there.Also if anybody has any extra pointers I may not have covered I'm all ears,especially if you have tips on housing with little to nothing to my name(not against the idea of homeless shelters in the slightest),like are there any kind of extended stays or motels that have better rates for long term living and areas to try and avoid as a new comer/trying to learn the city.

Help me choose a neighborhood?,"Me (21NB) &amp; my girlfriend (22F) are looking to move to Chicago in the coming year, and are trying to figure out which neighborhood would be best to move to. We have plans to visit, but not much money to work with in order to do so. Unless we can find someone to stay with, we'll likely only get a few days. So, I'd like to narrow down my options as much as possible before then.

Both of us are trans, leftist, and working artists. Local art markets are a plus, but as we both work independently we don't have a set location for jobs. In general, having an art community to connect with others our fields is the most important thing.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Queer community. Bonus points if there's a big trans community

- Walkable/Good public transit. Neither of us own a car and do not plan to.
- AFFORDABLE. This is the snag with most places we've looked at. Low cost of living is a must.

WANTS:
- Somewhere that skews younger.
- Access to movie theaters through public transit.
- Coffee shops, record stores, thrifting.
- Local music acts.
- A place where you can be social without drinking.

At this point, we're pretty torn between Logan Square and Rogers Park. I love the artsy hipster vibe and access to the blue line in Logan, but I'm worried about cost of living. I'm being priced out of my current city due to very rapid gentrification and would like to avoid a repeat of that. Rogers Park seems more on the sleepy &amp; family-oriented side, but is a lot less risky price-wise.

"""NoCrimeNovember"" Post-Mortem Review - and changes to our moderation policies","Hi folks - on behalf of the /r/chicago mod team, we hope you all had a great Thanksgiving and are having a good holiday season so far.

As November has come to a close, it's time to discuss the results of our [“No Crime November”](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/qmnbac/announcing_nocrimenovember/) experiment and how we plan to moderate crime-related posts going forward.
 
To review, the problems we set out to solve with NCN were:
 
* The volume of crime posts on the front page drowning out discussion of other topics of interest to the r/chicago userbase
 
* The routinely negative quality of the discussion surrounding such threads, with ensuing impact on the overall atmosphere of the subreddit
 
* A potential over-representation of such threads resulting from the actions of brigading groups
 
Without further ado, our analysis:

---
 
###WHAT WORKED WELL
 
* *Frontpage Improvements*  - Users immediately began to report increased satisfaction with the content on our front page.  We've seen an explosion of interesting discussion threads, local interest stories, and cool pictures that otherwise might have fallen by the wayside. In addition to the effects of NCN, we also loosened our restrictions on what sorts of posts were allowed on the main /r/chicago page vs in the Weekly Casual Conversation and Questions Thread.
 
* *Reduced Slapfighting* - Subjectively, we've experienced a dramatic drop in the number of personal attacks and arguments we've had to adjudicate.  If you'd like some objective numbers, in October, human mods had to remove 2,392 comments for violating subreddit rules.  At time of writing, we've had to remove 1,391 comments in November, an almost 50% reduction in the quantity of rule-breaking comments.
 
* *Subreddit Vibe* - From the moment NCN was implemented and throughout the month, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback about the new quality of the subreddit. 
 
###WHAT DIDN'T WORK WELL
 
*Messaging.*

* Our initial post did not adequately explain the criteria for allowed and not-allowed posts under the new rule (i.e. that this new policy primarily targeted violent and petty crime events that targeted an individual or group of individuals rather than affecting the greater city)

* We did not adequately convey that this rule only applied to top-level posts, and that no new restrictions would apply to discussions in comment threads.

* We did not discuss consequences for breaking this rule at length, leading some users to erroneously believe they would be punished for violations beyond simply having the offending post removed.
 
---
 
###CHANGES TO OUR MODERATION POLICIES AND THE SUBREDDIT RULES
 
Due to the success of the trial period, we have decided to enact the following permanent changes, effective immediately:
 
###**1. Crime Posts**
 
***The following types of crime-related posts are not allowed, and will be removed:***
 
* “Crime Recap” posts (e.g. articles with titles such as “10 People Shot Across Chicago Last Weekend”)
 
* Posts about a violent or petty crime targeting private individual(s) without greater impact on the Chicago area (e.g. a news article about someone being shot, carjacked, robbed, etc.)

* Posts that use crime-related dogwhistles to bait users (e.g. “We need to talk about crime in Chicago. This city is out of control! Kim Foxx needs to go!”, etc.) *(EDIT: fixed wording to be more clear)*

***The following crime-related posts are still allowed at moderator discretion:***

* Crimes involving a high-profile public figure in Chicago (e.g. an alderman being charged with corruption, the owner of a prominent business being accused of assault, etc.). *NOTE: Multiple posts about the same event are not allowed unless they represent significant developments in the story (e.g. daily Jussie Smollett trial updates are not allowed)*

* Crimes committed by a government official in their capacity as such (eg corruption, misconduct, etc.)

* Crimes that have a broad impact on the city (e.g. terror attacks, riots, crimes resulting in protests, etc.). *NOTE: In some cases, discussion of significant events may be restricted to a single megathread.*

*  Articles from trusted news sources that discuss the effects of crime at a high level may be allowed at moderator discretion (e.g. an article from the Tribune or Sun Times about how X crime rose over the course of the year may be allowed)

We will be updating Rule 10 to reflect this change in policy.

###**2. Questions/Conversation Posts**

*We will be allowing high-quality discussion threads outside of the Weekly Casual Conversation &amp; Questions Thread, and will be encouraging threads that meet the following criteria:*

* Question posts that ask an open-ended, discussion-driven question (think /r/AskReddit-style posts but specific to Chicago)

- Recommendations requests with well-defined criteria that local Chicagoans would find interesting (e.g. A post titled “best non-deepdish pizza restaurants in Chicago” would be allowed, but a post titled “visiting Chicago, where should I eat” would be redirected to the weekly questions thread). *Please note that we will expect users to search the subreddit for the question prior to asking, and in some cases may remove the question if it was asked previously*

- Discussion posts that share a fun fact about Chicago (*e.g. TIL Austin was ceded to Chicago by Cicero for allowing the L to extend into Oak Park*), talks about an issue currently pertinent to Chicago (*e.g. “The election is coming up, here’s how to register to vote”*), or shares information that is otherwise relevant or interesting to Chicagoans (*e.g. “the newly rebuilt intersection at x and y streets is dangerous because of z factors”*)

*The following posts are still not allowed on the main page and, in some cases, may be redirected to the Weekly Casual Conversation &amp; Questions Thread:*

* Posts asking for generalized recommendations (e.g. “visiting Chicago, what to do?”) 

* Posts looking for friends or social groups 

* Rants or low-effort discussion posts (e.g. a hot-take about a member of a Chicago sports team)

* Witch-hunts or posts trying to find out information about a specific individual (e.g “John Smith at 123 Oak Street was my neighbor back in 2003, does anyone know him?”)

* General posts about moving to or visiting Chicago (*NOTE: the [r/Chicago Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/index) has a lot of useful information about visiting or moving to Chicago*)

* Questions that can easily be answered by Google, or questions that are specialized in a way that only benefits the person asking it (e.g. “What time does the Mariano’s in Lakeview close on Wednesdays?”, or “How much should my gas bill be in a garden unit for the month of February?”)

Ultimately the decision of what is or isn’t allowed is at the discretion of the moderator, but we will try our best to operate under the criteria outlined above.

---

Finally, we do want to thank everyone for the feedback (both positive and negative) we received through the [NCN thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/qmnbac/announcing_nocrimenovember/), comments in other threads, and private modmail messages. We did read and consider all feedback when deciding on our next steps. Ultimately, we feel that our November experiment has had an overwhelmingly positive impact on the /r/chicago subreddit, and it is our hope that this community continues to trend in a more positive direction with the new rules in place.

We understand that this new policy, as with NCN, will not be popular with everyone in the community. For those of you who want a new place on reddit to discuss crime in Chicago, there are several other Chicago-related subreddits that allow discussion of individual crime events, and we encourage you to post crime-related content that is no longer allowed in /r/chicago to those communities instead.

Once again, we'd like to thank everyone for their suggestions, feedback, support, and continued trust.",chicago,0,1638332743.0,581,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/r66a91/nocrimenovember_postmortem_review_and_changes_to/,"""NoCrimeNovember"" Post-Mortem Review - and changes to our moderation policies Hi folks - on behalf of the /r/chicago mod team, we hope you all had a great Thanksgiving and are having a good holiday season so far.

Chicago neighborhoods with bicycle infrastructure,"My wife and I are planning on moving into the city in March, and we've found some potential apartments, but there is one thing that I'm worried about; biking around the city. We are from Japan and riding bikes around where we lived was relatively easy and safe. But riding bikes in Chicago seems to be a lot more challenging. While there are some bike lanes, most of them are unprotected with a small strip in between the main road cars and other cars making right turns.  I tried driving in the city to get an idea of the driving habits of people, and honestly from the things I've witnessed, I'm so worried about the safety of my wife if she decides to ride a bike.

It seems like cars don't obey any of the rules. Even today, I had to go into the city, and while waiting at a red light, a car literally made a left turn on red and almost hit a pedestrian crossing the street.The area we are considering is between the south and west loop, near Lasalle Street. By bike, there are a couple of grocery stores only 5-10 minutes away, but walking takes about 20 minutes.

The issue is the area doesn't have bike lines. In Chicago, I know it's illegal to ride on sidewalks, but riding in the street seems even more dangerous.Do you have any recommendations for places to live in the city that have safer infrastructure for bikes?We are open to any part of Chicago as long as it's safe, however, we would like to be close to some grocery markets (Target, Trader Joe's, etc). We also found an Asian market called Gangnam Market, and she likes that grocery store since it has most of the ingredients we need for cooking.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You :)

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who responded to my post. My wife and I were really surprised by how many people were willing to help us. We stayed up late researching additional places in Logan Square, Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Lincoln Park.

From the places we saw online and a combination of Google Maps, the Logan Square/Wicker Park area has a nice homey feel, along with some nice bike lanes. Plus it's pretty close Joong Boo and Gangnam Market by bike and train. Gonna scout the area over the weekend to get a better feel of the area.

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who responded to my post. My wife and I were really surprised by how many people were willing to help us. We stayed up late researching additional places in Logan Square, Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Lincoln Park.

From the places we saw online and a combination of Google Maps, the Logan Square/Wicker Park area has a nice homey feel, along with some nice bike lanes. Plus it's pretty close Joong Boo and Gangnam Market by bike and train. Gonna scout the area over the weekend to get a better feel of the area.

We realize that Chicago will not come close to what we are used to in Japan, but finding a middle ground is good enough for us.","['Loop', 'Lincoln Park', 'Wicker Park', 'Bucktown', 'Logan Square', 'West Loop']","['dangerous', 'worried']",2,Neutral/Concern,0.505

Moving to Chicago from Albuquerque,"Hello! I’m seriously considering moving to Chicago with my best friend from Albuquerque, NM and wondering if anyone has any tips. The main things:

- My friend and I want to live somewhere in the Loop (we are astonished daily that rent prices are almost comparable to ABQ there). Does anyone have any suggestions on where to look for decent apartments, buildings to avoid, etc.? I will most likely be working remotely, I don’t know what he plans to do yet. (edit): I plan to try to get a job that is more established in my desired field once I have a bit more agency work which is what I’m working on right now. I am hoping to make moves toward community focused marketing and project management in the public sector, for instance, helping run political campaigns, nonprofits, charitable funds, etc.. My friend is a brewer and also wants to do comedy at night. 

- I would love to keep my car but don’t necessarily need it in the city. I need to be able to regularly travel to Rochester, MN (about 1-2x/month) and would like to be able to make the drive instead of fly. Are there any parking options in the outer city that I might be able to get to from the L? If anyone has any other suggestions that’d be awesome! I’ve heard having a car in the city is a huge pain so any info is appreciated. 

- I’ve read about the winters and know that will be an adjustment. Winters in ABQ get down in the 30s at the lowest (sometimes 20s if mother nature is feeling cheeky), but it’s almost always sunny, which I hear is very different in Chicago. How do you all fair with seasonal depression? The cold I can handle, but SAD is my biggest worry lol. 

- I’m not super worried about crime because, well, I grew up in Albuquerque, but any info on areas to avoid and things to watch out for would be appreciated!

If there’s anything else you think I should know, any info is appreciate! Thank you! 

edit: Thank you for everyons help! A few of you have asked for more details so for those interested, here it is. I am looking to move mainly for career and graduate school reasons. I’m very interested in programs at both Northwestern and the University of Chicago but most of them want more work experience post undergraduate so that is what I am working on, along with what I said above. As far as my interests go, I have to admit I’m more interested in day life than night life, particularly coffee shops, farmers markets, museums, and nice places to hang out and do work. I like to be outside so, obviously in the summer, it’d be nice to have easy access to parks and nice places to walk/run. That said, I’m still very interested in nightlife, it’s just not the most important thing. I’m not a huge drinker. Ultimately, I’ve always wanted to live in a city and the most important thing to me is I get to experience living in a big city. I love the fast pace and bustle of cities and I want to live in an area that’s like that. 

My friend has a lot of similar goals with the city. He originally suggested the loop after hearing about that being the heart of downtown from some friends (although that seems to be conflicting with what some of you all say). He wants to be around that fast pace. I think he will definitely want a bit more nightlife as he wants to try to pursue comedy, but he also loves the day life stuff too. He does not know where he will be working but it will likely be in the brewing industry because he is currently a manager at a large brewery in New Mexico. 

We both want the city experience we didn’t get growing up in Albuquerque, and want to pursue our career goals.

"Is it suicide to move to a neighborhood like Woodlawn, Englewood, or Chatham?","I live in AZ currently, and I have a high standard of living and low expenses.  My wife and I are moving to Chicago soon, and I've been researching real estate.  This is what I've found:
 
1.  Living anywhere near downtown is basically impossible.  If the price tag doesn't ruin you, the taxes will.  I'm not saying it's not worth it, it's just that we're not wealthy.
 
Living North of the loop, prices stay relatively outrageous until you get up near O'Hare.  The reason for this seems to be the low crime rate.  It seems like I can afford to live in a garden unit of some buildings, but even then, I'm still at the top of my price range.
 
2.  Living South of the loop gets hairy... fast.  The prices are much more reasonable, but according to the various crime data maps, these are much more dangerous areas.  Additionally, they don't offer the type of lifestyle we would like (walking to restaurants and groceries. Very little driving.)
 
3.  Super far south, we could live in a mansion (literally) and almost buy it cash.  Taxes are low.  We would have access to both the Green and Red lines as well as a garage for our car(s). And the crime stats are scary.

Monday CTA rant,"* My home stop is Wellington. About a month ago I tweeted @CTA (#CTAfails) that one of the doors at the Wellington stop has been broken for more than a year. As in it always has caution tape up blocking the door, and has had caution tape up continuously at least since 2013. So rather than fixing the door, they just keep reapplying caution tape. For at least a year. The week after I tweeted them the door was miraculously in service for the first time since I'd lived in this neighborhood. As of last week, the door is again apparently broken and has caution tape up again. What the fuck? Will you fix the fucking door? Does it take more than a year to fix a door?
* Got to Wellington station this morning; as is always the case when its rainy or snowy, the ground floor entrance was covered in a puddle of water. Wellington is apparently one of the newer stations. This isn't one of the stations from the 19th century, it was rebuilt in 2008. And yet it flood with a half inch of water any time its wet out. Who the fuck is responsible for this incompetent architecture? I have never been in any other commercial building where the tiny amount of moisture tracked in by people walking is enough to flood a building. As long as we're going to have machine politics and powerful unions that are hard to be kept accountable by traditional means, the other side of the coin is that the mayor is supposed to take whoever is accountable for this failure out back and shoot him in the head.
* Walked up to the Wellington platform; there's a CTA employee standing there doing nothing while the entire platform is covered in snow. This is 8:20am already. They could have finished shoveling the entirety of both platforms hours ago. What the fuck are they doing?
* Wait 5 minutes for a train to come... It's a Purple. Wait another 8 minutes for the Brown I need. 13 minute wait. According to the schedule, Brown line trains are supposed to come every 4-7 minutes. It hasn't been snowing for hours. There's no legitimate excuse for delays. There are trains that run in the mountains amidst 20 feet of snow there is no reason besides managerial incompetence that the L can't operate on schedule many hours after a blizzard is over.
* Arrived at my final station in the Loop. The stairs going down are **packed with ice** and incredibly dangerous. I am a young man and I usually run down these stairs 2 at a time, but today I was taking them sideways to get enough room to put my foot on each one amidst the packed snow and ice and afraid for my life the whole time.

How safe is Lawndale for a concert?,"My 17 year-old son wants to go with a few friends to the Lyrical Lemonade Summer Bash concert at Douglas Park in Lawndale at the end of June.

1. No driving/parking &amp; no public transpo - they have get a ride there and back from a reliable, trustworthy adult.  Found out the mom of one of his friends drove last year.  They need to arrange something like that again.
2. They have to be aware of their surroundings and help each other steer clear or walk away from any situations with people who are being aggressive.  Not the time to prove you’re not a punk.
3. Phone - leave the house at 100% and no burning battery life on stupid shit - and be responsive to a few check-ins.  
4. They need to be at a designated pick up spot 100% on time.

Posting Because People Keep Asking Me: Are you wondering if it's possible to live in/near Chicago and commute to AbbVie/Abbott on the North Shore WITHOUT driving?,"Several people reached out to me after I answered this question once so I wanted to put up a post here for reference.

Short answer: yes! Just live near a Metra UP-N stop. I have a couple friends who work at AbbVIe and live in/immediately outside of Chicago and do it daily. It's very easy and they get to work in/around an hour without having to drive.

AbbVie/Abbott campuses are way up on the North Shore and appear to be very far from the actual city of Chicago. The METRA UP-N train runs very close to all of their sites and AbbVie (and I'd imagine Abbott too) run shuttles to and from the Metra stops in the mornings and afternoons. The exact shuttle schedule I'm not sure of but I'm sure AbbVie/Abbott staff who help with relocation can provide those. I've heard that AbbVie also has their own ""Uber""-esq free car service where you can request rides between sites (and after the shuttles stop if working early/late) and I think there are also shuttles that run between the different sites.

One of my close friends lives in Ravenswood and another lives in Evanston. They both live walking distance to the Metra UP-N stops (Ravenswood and Evanston-Davis St). They both take about an hour to get to work (including the shuttle ride to their sites). My Evanston friend also drives occasionally and it takes about 50 minutes driving (he takes Route 41 N to avoid tolls).

Stops to Live Near in Chicago proper: Ogilvie (major train station/transit center, southernmost stop down in the ""heart"" of the city), Clybourn, Ravenswood, Peterson/Ridge, Rogers Park

Evanston stops (not Chicago but first city right outside of Chicago): Main (southernmost, last stop outside of Chi), Davis (best ""downtown"" part of Ev), Central

\^ Will not need a vehicle for most of these areas.

Other cities I've heard my friends mention their coworkers enjoy living: Highland Park, Waukegan, Libertyville. You'll ~~likely~~ need a car for these areas.

Please feel free to ask me questions and I can try and grab the answers from these friends who do this daily, I hope that this little post makes the idea of commuting less intimidating for those who are unfamiliar with Chicago.

"Moving to Irving Park next month, things to look out for I'm moving close to the kimball and Irving Park rd area in about a month, anything I should lookout for?","Moving to Irving Park next month, things to look out for

I'm moving close to the kimball and Irving Park rd area in about a month, just looking to see if any locals can give me a heads up regarding safety, things to do for fun etc.

I wouldn't be moving there if I thought it was unsafe, and toured an apartment on kimball about a month ago. It seemed like a nice area, people were out walking their dogs and there was a lot of morning traffic, all in all I liked it.

 I'm from Dallas so im no stranger to navigating rough parts of town. That being said, the best way to navigate them is to avoid them if possible.

I'm moving close to the kimball and Irving Park rd area in about a month, just looking to see if any locals can give me a heads up regarding safety, things to do for fun etc.

I wouldn't be moving there if I thought it was unsafe, and toured an apartment on kimball about a month ago. It seemed like a nice area, people were out walking their dogs and there was a lot of morning traffic, all in all I liked it.

 I'm from Dallas so im no stranger to navigating rough parts of town. That being said, the best way to navigate them is to avoid them if possible.

Where to meet Bucktown/Wicker single guys (unhinged/funny advice welcome)?,"I (28F) am moving to Chicago (specifically Bucktown area) August 1st. I’m single and I’d prefer to meet people in real life rather than the apps, so looking for the best spots/activities to put myself more out there. Ideally looking for 28+ men, cute would be a plus. Open to some unhinged advice or local intel as these posts get redundant, current ideas are:

•	⁠Midtown Athletic: ridiculously expensive and reviews say it’s a lot of families, but might have some guys with cash to burn because why does it cost hundreds of dollars a month??

•	⁠Bars: I hate going alone but I’ve seen some good bars recommended already. I could probably drag a friend with me, but any intel on where the cute 28-30+ year old guys go? Trying to avoid too young or old of a crowd for meeting, and ideally somewhere more social. I will throw out my worst pick up lines

•	⁠Activities: I had a trivia group in my previous city and I’ve seen more active groups like walking/run clubs are big here. Any specific recs in this area?

•	⁠Lurking: There are some grocery stores, coffee shops and parks I could post up at in the area. I like dogs, and feel more comfortable hanging alone in these locations if anyone knows where I’d have the best luck. I hear Midwest people can be easier to strike up some small talk, and dogs (I don’t have one) usually break the ice

•	⁠Hoping and praying it just happens naturally

Is foot traffic down in Chicago?,"I visited Chicago for a few days to meet a supplier. I had free time to walk around and some immediate observations were just how empty the streets felt. 

Now granted I live in New York, and a great deal of Manhattan is packed with people, stores, and art installations on every bloc. 

But I’m also very familiar with DC and San Francisco, two cities that have some of that same energy in a smaller package. 

LA/Miami are more car oriented, but with Chicago I expected something closer to NY and got something very different. 

Mind you I walked around the loop and Michigan Ave. so I didn’t get a chance to explore the South Side or Chinatown. I probably went from the Lake down past the bean on the other side of the river and went inland as far as Willis Tower. 

I was there on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. I was out both early in the morning after 9am, 3pm, and around midnight. It’s November obviously so I don’t know if that changes anything… 

But pretty much very few people even in downtown central areas. The Bean had a lot of tourists taking pictures and its plaza area felt alive, but outside of that it felt like most of the storefront areas were closed or dying. 

This isn’t an economic assessment, just the mood I got from the city. Many streets had blank storefronts with parking lots and air vents walling off the streets. The More commercial part of Magnificent Mile had some big brands but not a lot of people, and the business district around Willis Tower was completely empty. 

I get things vary neighborhood to neighborhood, but I was in the heart of downtown and it felt like a small city with tall buildings. I can’t explain the sensation but San Francisco is objectively smaller yet it made me feel like I was in New York more than Chicago. Even DC around DuPont Circle had more going on, let alone Georgetown. 

I’m not trying to bash Chicago. On the positive side I didn’t see many homeless people and it was clean compared to other places I’ve been to. But I was expecting more from a dense and walkable city. 

Downtown Miami was worse IMO, but they have always been car centric and most of the energy is by the beach. With Chicago I didn’t find that center of energy, and the streets felt kinda dead. 

And this is a bit more out there, but all the brands I found were basic big brands, I’m used to stumbling upon something cool or different when I walk around a big city and it just wasn’t there. Maybe there are clubs and rooftop bars I missed, but even the nightlife felt… missing? 

I was only there for three days so I’m not a voice of authority at all. I just wanted to know if this is a wider trend locals are aware of or is it just me? 

And outside the loop/downtown area, are there places like Greenwich Village or Georgetown? I still had fun tbh, the Carbon building was cool to see, no hate.

"New Grad Moving to Chicago (Transit, Airport, Safety, Green Spaces, etc.)","Hi everyone! Like some previous posts here, I am considering moving to Chicago soon. To focus the discussion a bit (and help you all think about recommendations), I have identified some of my must-haves and hopes and some previous research I have done.

About Me:

* Remote job, but occasionally will need to travel domestically (sometimes outside of the Chicago area)
* Mid-20s living alone

Must haves:

* Budget: One-bedroom apartment under $1500. (edit: is this reasonable or too low?)
* Public transit: CTA (bus and/or the L) is a must, Metra would be nice but not necessary.
* Decent access to airports: I will be traveling occasionally as a part of my job, including going to airports. I prefer to be closer to O'Hare because I also use that airport to fly home. Think 75 minutes to O'Hare with transit max. For Midway, I am less concerned right now.
* Safety: Generally I am hearing that other than some south neighborhoods, places are safe as long as I avoid a couple of blocks in any neighborhood. Correct me if I am wrong for the neighborhoods you are aware of.
* Groceries: Walking or transit distance - 15 minutes.
* Retail: A good number of restaurants, shops, and cafes. It does not have to be like downtown, but I would like to eat out sometimes!
* Green space: Generally I would like to have sidewalks that have green space in the residential parts of town so that I don't go crazy. Some good parks nearby are a plus!

Hopes: Access to gyms nearby

I also had some time to visit some of the neighborhoods that people mentioned on this thread or others during the day. Here are my (personal) reactions. Feel free to comment on my observations as well, as I just walked around in the following areas:

* Edgewater/Uptown: A good hub for young people and a good mix of families and elders. Having Lake Michigan is nice, quiet residential areas, and good pockets of restaurants and shops. The only con here is that going to O'Hare in particular takes more than an hour.
* Old Town: I saw more housing complexes than individual houses (just observation). There's good stuff to do in Wells Street (pretty good and lively).
* Palmer Square / Logan Square: Less red brick buildings south of Logan Square, more red brick in Palmer Square; Boulevards! Heard that these areas are on the expensive side...?
* Avondale: There are houses of various styles and colors, which I liked. Good amount of green space.
* Jefferson Park: I went south of the Metra/CTA transit center and the Jefferson Park (park) is a bit barren so I personally didn't like that. I also saw the north side has a better variety of houses than the south side (splitting by that transit center).

These following neighborhoods I did not have a chance to go to: Wicker Park / Bucktown area and Lake View.

* Edgewater/Uptown: A good hub for young people and a good mix of families and elders. Having Lake Michigan is nice, quiet residential areas, and good pockets of restaurants and shops. The only con here is that going to O'Hare in particular takes more than an hour.
* Old Town: I saw more housing complexes than individual houses (just observation). There's good stuff to do in Wells Street (pretty good and lively).
* Palmer Square / Logan Square: Less red brick buildings south of Logan Square, more red brick in Palmer Square; Boulevards! Heard that these areas are on the expensive side...?
* Avondale: There are houses of various styles and colors, which I liked. Good amount of green space.
* Jefferson Park: I went south of the Metra/CTA transit center and the Jefferson Park (park) is a bit barren so I personally didn't like that. I also saw the north side has a better variety of houses than the south side (splitting by that transit center).

These following neighborhoods I did not have a chance to go to: Wicker Park / Bucktown area and Lake View.

This is a lot of information, but hope you all have something to start your discussions. I really appreciate all your help!","['Wicker Park', 'Bucktown', 'Logan Square', 'Edgewater', 'Uptown', 'Avondale', 'Jefferson Park']","['avoid', 'alone']",2,Neutral/Concern,0.614
"As a visitor to the city, I just want to give a thank you to the quick work of your police officers last night after shots were fired near my friend's place.","Around 10:30pm we heard about 8 shots fired right outside the apartment (my friend lives in Wicker Park and was told just yesterday that there is rarely violence in the immediate vicinity of his place).  It was the first time I've heard shots fired on the street so obviously I was shaken.    

Within about a minute, sirens were screaming and we heard them coming closer.  I hopped on chicagoscanner.com and was following the scenario live.  Within about a 20 minutes your officers had multiple people in custody after they found ditched cars and weapons nearby.  I was shocked how fast they got the situation under control.  No one was injured thankfully.

New to the city: Woman commuting at 5.45am -- is this a good idea?,"Hi Chicago! I have another ""should I live in this neighborhood"" question you guys love to answer -- sorry! I'm going to be working by Willis/Sears Tower for a few months (January - April) and I wanted to ask about two areas in regard to early morning safety. I'm a late 20s woman and I've found a sub-lease at N Clybourn &amp; Webster. I know Lincoln Park is generally considered safe, but I need to be at the office by 6.30am and I'm a little concerned. I've been to Chicago a few times on holiday (freaking love the city and hope to move permanently one day), but I'm not super familiar with the area and the public transportation is kind of lacking in the immediate vicinity. 

Google Maps tells me I have three options, all leaving between 5.45a-6am, total commute time 32-42 minutes:

1). Walk ~20 minutes to Armitage &amp; Sheffield and take the Brown Line to Quincy &amp; Adams. There's a Starbucks that will be open on Armitage, which makes me feel better, but there's not a whole lot of stuff between the apartment and it.

2). Walk ~6 minutes across the bridge to Ashland &amp; Webster and hop on the 9 bus. Change at Harrison &amp; Ashland (5 minute wait), drops me off right outside the office. The street view looks a bit sketchy/empty around Ashland, especically where the bus stop is. 

3). Walk ~6 to Fullerton &amp; Greenview for the 74 bus. Change at Fullerton &amp; Sheffield (5 minute wait) for the 37 bus, drops me off ~4 minutes away from the office. Fullerton &amp; Greenview has a lot more businesses, but they won't be open at that time. 

Any thoughts on which option I should take?  Will the cold weather deter a lot of potential threats? I hate running, and I really hate running when there's ice. Am I completely overthinking it? OR should I look somewhere near DePaul/Fullerton/Diversey in LP and hop on the Brown Line from there? I used to live in San Francisco with similar early hours, but I knew that city really well and which streets to avoid, etc. I've been living in ridiculously safe cities for the past few years and feel like I've lost a bit of my street-smart intuition. Any insight to soothe my neurotic and over-prepared personality is greatly appreciated. :) 

Thanks!

How bad is the red line really?,"I live in andersonville and just recently got a job in river north, and I will have to take the red line alone to get to work every day.

Help with Itinerary? Plus mini rant,"Hi guys! I'mma be in Chicago from August 15 to 18 and I'm pretty excited. I've never been so I'm trying to plan my visit. So far I have:

8/15:

Arrive in Chicago around 2PM. Maybe have dinner at John Hancock tower after check in at the hotel (downtown area) and settling in.

8/16:

Breakfast (was recced Yolk South Loop) and then Field Museum from about 10 AM - 2 PM. Have Lunch somewhere around the museum. Visit Lincoln Park. And maybe go to the Cubs game at 7 PM.

8/17:

Breakfast (undecided) then Millenium Park in the morning. Was recced Oasis cafe for lunch. Do the magnificent mile + riverwalk. And I booked the Architecture River Cruise at 7:30 PM.

8/18:

Having breakfast with a friend (undecided where) and then going to the airport.

Alright, now for the mini rant. I'm currently living in LA. I'm very excited for this trip because Chicago is a city that I've been considering moving to in a couple of years, after I finish my degree here and am able to apply for better jobs. Soooo many LA people keep fearmongering me about the dangers of Chicago and how violent it is. Some are even trying to talk me out of the trip. 

I understand that, but from what I've seen I'm not going to visit any particularly dangerous part of Chicago. Also... I'm from Brazil lol. I've spent half of my life living in Rio, a city where there's no real such thing as a ""safe"" neighborhood. I lived in a neighborhood that had FOUR favelas. I know how to operate in dangerous places. I know to not use my phone in public, be aware of my surroundings, trust my gut, not wear jewelry, stay in crowded areas, wear any bags across the chest etc. Also, LA has plenty of unsafe areas too. I've never had a problem navigating them. When I mentioned my trip to my manager she just gave me a side-eye and said ""be careful."" Another girl keeps telling me I'm gonna get murdered every time I mention my trip. I'd be lying if I said it didn't bum me out because I'm excited but there's few people to share the excitement with.

Also, last thing. I love thrift shopping so if anyone has any thrift shop recommendations around the downtown area lemme know. Thanks!

Living in Albany Park,"Moving to Albany Park?

Hi folks,  my SO and I are moving to Chicago in about a month. After lots and lots of research, I think we’ve settled on Albany Park as our destination. We like it because it seems fairly safe, has lots of food options, is close to other cool neighborhoods, and most importantly is relatively affordable.  

Wondering what your thoughts are on living in this neighborhood?  Does it feel pretty safe?  We are considering a couple of apartments in the following areas:

-N. Mozart by the NW corner of Horner Park—a little worried that this is too far from the closest L stop, for when my SO needs to make the walk alone at night

Hi, I'm a bot. Thankfully, I'm not AutoModerator. My job is just to gather some of the best posts from our neighbors. The intention is to create awareness of the speciality subs that relate to r/Chicago. If you have a suggestion about what other subreddits that I should check out, send me a message via my creator: /u/MargretTatchersParty.","['Rogers Park', 'Portage Park']","['attacked', 'mugged']",2,Neutral/Concern,0.546
"Going to start working the overnight shift in the loop, live in Bucktown. Do I need a car?","I survived my first year here without a car just fine. Groceries and random chores were a pain, as was getting around the city to meet friends. I spent a ton on Uber. Also, my significant other lives in Milwuakee so getting there via amtrak and a combination of ubers would cost about 50-80 bucks round trip (alternate weekend visits).

I commuted to work using the blue line (a 15 min walk from my place, followed by another 10 min walk in the loop) or the 56 bus (which won't be running during overnight). I also bike to work currently because its the fastest way to get there. 

**The reasons I am considering getting a car:**

* Safety at night, avoid walking to blue line at midnight. Instead I would have a 10 min drive to the loop with free parking there until 8 AM (Which is when I could get out of work)

* Save money on potential ubers to work (when its bad weather/too cold, I would probably uber to work rather than walk to blue line $10 each ride)

* I live in a neighborhood with plenty of street parking

* Save money on bi-weekly commute to Milwaukee (50-80 bucks)

* Huge time spent on shopping/running chores (groceries, dry cleaning, random purchases)

* I can afford it without adjusting my lifestyle choices too much (In fact it could save me a lot of money)

**Reasons why I am not completely convinced:**

* I could get around groceries/goods by ordering them on amazon/instacart

* Leasing/Financing/Insuring/Maintaining a car would potentially cost me 300-400 a month plus some down-payment

* Not entirely sure of my future location (which is why I am leaning towards leasing)

* I could bike at night to work for the time being, until winter.

Thanks!

**TL:DR:**
Switching to Overnight Shift. Work in loop live in bucktown. Also go visit SO in Milwaukee. Should I get a car?

I also want to play golf more and go to the driving range. This is nearly impossible without a car or friends with one.

"You guys have been great, so I want to know your opinions on Bronzeville.","I know it a higher crime area, and it's not very racially diverse (somewhere around 80% black) but the real estate is affordable, and we could have easy access to public transportation and downtown. Should I really be worried about crime rates and school quality? 
 
Also, as my wife and I are decidedly *not* black, should we expect to be welcomed as part of the community? Would we be making ourselves targets for harassment or muggings? 
 
I don't mean to sound naive, but I just think these neighborhoods will never improve if educated, friendly, hard working people refuse to live there. And it would be nice to live in a low-cost decent sized place near downtown.

Neighborhoods to Move to Chicago?,"Hello! I’m thinking of moving to Chicago either this winter or next and need help figuring out which neighborhood would be the best fit!

I spent all of August there and completely fell in love with the city. I stayed in the West Loop, but also spent time up north in Logan Square/Avondale, Bucktown/Wicker Park, Roscoe Village, Lakeview East/Lincoln Park, Andersonville, and even the suburbs lol.

West Loop and the surrounding areas were cool, but I definitely prefer the neighborhoods further north in terms of architecture and things to do. West Loop feels a bit too sterile for me, and it’s also way outside my price range.

For context: I’m 24F, an artist, social, and physically active. I’m born and raised in NYC, so I understand city dynamics and that no neighborhood is 100% perfect in terms of safety. I’m looking for a fun but generally safe area for a woman in her mid-twenties living alone.

Ideally, I want a neighborhood that’s a bit slower-paced and more residential, but still has essential and social spots (grocers, bars, gyms, cafés, restaurants, etc.) and fun things to do within walking distance. Basically something similar to neighborhoods in Queens or Brooklyn.

I’d also love to avoid the newer, cookie-cutter white box apartments. I’m drawn to something more vintage or pre-war with craftsmanship and character. I know those buildings tend to be up north, but I’m having a hard time figuring out exactly which areas have the most of them based on listings online.

Public transportation and bikeability are really important to me, too. I only used Divvy while I was there, and since I’m coming from NYC (spoiled by the MTA lol), I’m not totally sure how CTA compares—but I figure I’ll learn.

Diversity is also important to me, and I know that’s more limited in some of the northern neighborhoods. Right now I’m looking between Logan Square and Lakeview East, Pilsen, and some of the closer-to-downtown areas. My budget is $1550–$1600 (including utilities). I’m currently job-hunting, so I’m not sure if I should pick a neighborhood based on work yet, but I don’t mind commuting.

I know this is a long list of criteria and might be a lot to ask for, but if I’m moving halfway across the country, I want it to be as close to perfect as possible! Any advice or general insights would be super appreciated.

Questions about which neighborhoods to consider in moving to in Chicago.,"Hello,

I first off want to apologize for how basic and common this post is, but I feel like my priorities are unique enough to warrant a post. I'm planning on moving to Chicago in September, and I'd figure I'd ask for input on which specific neighborhoods to look at when I visit to find housing:

What im looking for (im no particular order):
1.) Reasonably safe. I'm moving from a bad part of New Orleans where ive been for nine years, and am originally from Cleveland, so I'm well aware that cities are not vanilla suburbs, nor do i have the expectation of 100% safety. I work nights, so I guess I want to feel OK walking my dog at 1am. I'm not scared of the unhoused or addicts, but ideally just not an area of high violent crime.

2.) Ease of getting around the city via public transportation and car. I work in hospitality, and most likely will end up working in the loop, where I will most likely not live, so ease of getting around is important.

3.) Cool shops/restaurants/stuff. I'm 40 and in recovery, so nightlife/partying isn't what I'm looking for, but I love theatre/movies/live shows/eating out/ethnic cuisine/etc. 

4.) Affordability. I'm looking to spend $1200-$1550 on rent, for a 1 bedroom. I have a 40lb non-dangerous breed dog as well. I don't need a lot of space, but I do have a car, and would rather not have to spend hundreds on parking. 

Thank you for all of your help, I know this is an annoying question you must all get bombarded with regularly. So far I've been looking at Portage Park near the Blue Line L station, but would love to expand my search.",AskChicago,21,1683749311.0,47,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/13e1pj6/questions_about_which_neighborhoods_to_consider/,"Questions about which neighborhoods to consider in moving to in Chicago.

"What is Edgewater like? Or, other neighbourhood suggestions.","Today I am going to Apartment Finders to check out some places. I told the gentleman on the phone my price range, and he said that we'd focus our search on Edgewater. I've lived in Wicker Park, Lincoln Park, Roscoe Village, and Lincoln Square. These are all great areas, but I think out of my price range now.(Recently quit job to go back to school, living on savings and eating ramen.) I am almost completely ignorant on what kind of neighbourhood Edgewater is, and honestly most other neighbourhoods. I've lived in Chicago most of my life, but I am still pretty young and haven't paid much attention to other areas. How would you describe Edgewater? Is it nice? i.e. low crime, no hoodlums hanging around on corners, low amount of graffiti, etc. Is it crowded? Do they have a lot of street festivals in summer? Are there lots of cute little shops or is it mostly residential?

Alternatively can you suggest another area that I should look? I would prefer to stay on the north side, since my school and most of my friends are up here. My main focus is cheap and ""a low crime area"". I want to be able to come home after dark and not worry(too much) about being mugged, but still have the lowest rent possible. I am willing to sacrifice on size, a dishwasher, in-building laundry, parking(I actually don't own a car)- pretty much everything else in exchange for these two things.

The last time I asked for a suggestion on a new neighbourhood, I was told Albany Park by many people. I took that advice, and my last apartment was tagged on a regular basis, my boyfriend's car was broken into 3 times in 2 months, and we had police on our corner at least once a week to break up fights and arrest drug dealers. I am currently staying with a friend in Lincoln Park, and he gave me til September to get off his couch, which I am eager to do.

So with this in mind, where do you suggest I look, or what can you tell me about Edgewater?

Can you please critique my itinerary/give suggestions for next time?,"My sister and I came to Chicago last Thursday and overall it was a good experience. 

First Day:
-took CTA orange line to hotel 
-Went to Nutella cafe — good since we like Nutella 
-Strolled millenium park 
-Went to the Maggie Daley park — I love the Pedestrian Bridge don’t know why lol 
-Got lunch from Chicago dawgs — loved it but it was too acidic for my sis. Didn’t realize they didn’t the poppy seed bun there 😭
-Visited the Fine arts building— just to ride the manual elevator 😅
-Visited the Chicago cultural center— I love that place!!
-Went to Palmer House hotel— great architecture
-Architecture Boat Tour with Wendella— amazing experience. We booked 7:30 so we were able to get the sunset plus city lights at night time 
-Grabbed dinner from Wilma’s famous BBQ— we were tired and hungry after the tour and randomly chose this but it wasn’t good… 
-Ubered and walked to get around

Second Day: 
-Took the water taxi to Chinatown 
-Strolled Ping Tom Memorial Park 
-went to the Chinese American museum 
-got lunch from the Richland center — can’t remember where; was ok I think I picked wrong 
-Walked all over Chinatown square 
-Walked the area where the Pui Tak Center is, got food etc.
-We picked up dinner from Go 4 Food and it was sooo good! Their duck was delicious 
-We took the bus to go back to our hotel 
-We went to the Starbucks Reserve at nighttime 

Third Day:
-Got breakfast from Medici on 57th 
-Walked all over the university of Chicago campus, saw the Rockfeller memorial etc
-Went to ISAC
-Went to Midway Plaisance Park and we got to talk to some locals who were having a huge “HS reunion” type stuff 
-Went to 57th street beach 
-Had a late lunch at 14 Parish — the jibarito was good!
-Went to Jackson park, Japanese garden etc
-Walked Museum Campus a little bit 
This was the hardest day cause we kept getting lost… we walked so much! And then we got a taxi (not uber this time) when we wanted to go from 14 Paris to Jackson park and we ended up telling him to just drop us off wherever. We got into his vehicle and he didn’t follow the route then when we mapped it ourselves and realized we were too far from where he wanted to drop us off at, and when we told him he said that we entered the wrong address on purpose to it could be cheaper. We were like ok cool thanks we’d rather walk than deal with this 
-Later that night we went to LH Rooftop. Didn’t even get drinks but the view was everything!!! 

Fourth Day:
-Walked the RiverWalk — very scenic 
-Walked to Grant park to see the fountain etc. 
-Didn’t have time to visit the Art Institute but I went to the gardens 
-Then I got on the bus to go back towards La Salle… and ended up on 24th and Balbo street cause I got on the bus going in the opposite direction. The bus driver told me to get off, cross the sreet and get on the next bus. I must admit that I was a bit scared cause I didn’t see much activity around and idk the area. 
-The we got Lou Malnatis pizza - it was very disappointing lol I know better based on reviews but my sis wanted it 
-Then we transferred over to Lincoln park and went to the Zoo and conservatory 
-We went to Art Effect on Armitage 
-We went to several shops in Lincoln Square 
-We had dinner at Ciccio Mio and it was the best meal I’ve had during my stay 

Last Day: 
-Did a little shopping on Mag Mile
-Transferred over to Armitage (again) because I really wanted to visit the little quirky shops there 
-Then we did WNDR museum — super underwhelming but my sister wanted to 

I wish I had planned out the food better but I was more interested in seeing and doing things. 

All the horror stories I heard abt Chicagoans being rude turned out to be false. People were so nice and helpful. Not everyone was super smily but they were nice and they even say hi when passing you on the streets. 

Overall I think Chicago is a great city to visit and I can’t wait to be back!

Loop clean up after this weekend’s events,"UPDATE 8:40 am 6/2: Good morning all, unfortunately I have not had much success hearing back from the wards. However it is not surprising due to everything that is happening around our neighborhoods and suburbs. I will continue tracking and updating this post as I come across any new information. If you have anything that can be useful for all of us, please DM so I can include it in the post. Below are some of the organizations that I could locate online. One word of wisdom: PLEASE BE CAREFUL OF POTENTIAL SCAMS, BE AWARE THAT IN THESE UNFORTUNATE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS THERE ARE THOSE WHO TRY TO OBTAIN FINANCIAL GAIN BY CHEATING AND MISREPRESENTING THEMSELVES. PLEASE DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE PRIOR TO PROVIDING ANY SORT OF FINANCIAL HELP.

UPDATE as of 7:30 am 6/1: First of all, thank you for your patience while myself and a few others have been trying to figure out how we can help. 




1. As we have all seen over the past couple of days, our neighborhoods got destroys. So please take a look around your neighborhood first. See where you can give a hand. I heard about some members of this post are going over to Walgreens in Wicker Park located on Milwaukee and Armirage. So if you are in the area, they will appreciate a hand.

Location: 1750 E. 71st, Chicago (meet in the parking lot)
Call for more information: 773-609-3007

3. Please check FB to see if there are any other established organizations that are looking for volunteers. 

4. I emailed the Alderman to see where we are needed the most. 

5. Lastly if anyone has any additional information and would like to have it posted here for everyone to see, please DM me and I will update this post. 


Thank You all for your continued support of our city, communities and your patience. 

Please be safe out there and do not forget your PPE! Every single one of us matters and can make a difference! 


—-:—-:—-:———:——-:——:—-:——:—-:—-:——:—-


Would anyone be interested in joining up to help clean up the Loop after this protest? 

IMO, it won’t benefit any of us if our beautiful city remains in the current condition

—:—-:—-:——:—-:——:——:——:——:——:——:—-

UPDATE As of 6:30 this evening, I have not been able to get any information as to the best way to proceed. I will continue trying tomorrow. All I know is that with everything that’s going on, and CTA being closed, let’s see what tomorrow brings. Please be safe and don’t put yourself in compromising situations. Unfortunately our help will have to be POSTPONED again. As usual, if anyone hears anything to the contrary, please post it here or DM me. Thank you all! 

HELLO ALL, I just called the City Hall as well as Mayor’s Office and could not reach anyone regarding if we can go tomorrow or not. I was told by the City Hall Officer that an entire city is blocked off. I also tried reaching out to the Mayor via Next Door, but it looks like direct messages are blocked. If anyone knows other ways to reach either the Mayor or the Governor, I would appreciate your help. I also tried 311 and CPD. To figure out what to do we need someone with the authority. 
Lastly: my question to them was: can a number of volunteers go into the areas between 6-10 to clean up. 

Thank you for your help




UPDATE 4:41 pm: Since I don’t know if we will be able to access the areas that need our help, I will continue updating as I find out more. If anyone hears anything, please continue sharing in this post or DM me. 


UPDATE as of 3:48 pm: Someone has just informed me of the following: “The police are already trying to focus on more protesting. Over the police scanner you would have to be a resident of the area to go in it”. “Not until closures are lifted, looting was still going on this morning early afternoon.

Would anyone be interested in joining up to help clean up the Loop after this protest? 

IMO, it won’t benefit any of us if our beautiful city remains in the current condition

—:—-:—-:——:—-:——:——:——:——:——:——:—-

UPDATE As of 6:30 this evening, I have not been able to get any information as to the best way to proceed. I will continue trying tomorrow. All I know is that with everything that’s going on, and CTA being closed, let’s see what tomorrow brings. Please be safe and don’t put yourself in compromising situations. Unfortunately our help will have to be POSTPONED again. As usual, if anyone hears anything to the contrary, please post it here or DM me. Thank you all! 

HELLO ALL, I just called the City Hall as well as Mayor’s Office and could not reach anyone regarding if we can go tomorrow or not. I was told by the City Hall Officer that an entire city is blocked off. I also tried reaching out to the Mayor via Next Door, but it looks like direct messages are blocked. If anyone knows other ways to reach either the Mayor or the Governor, I would appreciate your help. I also tried 311 and CPD. To figure out what to do we need someone with the authority. 
Lastly: my question to them was: can a number of volunteers go into the areas between 6-10 to clean up. 

Thank you for your help




UPDATE 4:41 pm: Since I don’t know if we will be able to access the areas that need our help, I will continue updating as I find out more. If anyone hears anything, please continue sharing in this post or DM me. 


UPDATE as of 3:48 pm: Someone has just informed me of the following: “The police are already trying to focus on more protesting. Over the police scanner you would have to be a resident of the area to go in it”. “Not until closures are lifted, looting was still going on this morning early afternoon. The wood was removed and more damage was done at a Walgreens, at adams and Michigan”

Has anyone else heard about it? I would appreciate the confirmation.

* Are there any crime concerns I should be aware of? Is it generally a peaceful area, or are there specific precautions I should take?

Airbnbs in Chicago,"I’m getting close to wit’s end on this.
I moved to Chicago (Ukrainian Village to be exact) into an apartment building with commercial properties on the first floor. I didn’t realize that the building next to us which is a mirrored version of my building was used for Airbnbs.

Every other weekend there are guests that stay in those apartments, but regularly stay up late, well past midnight in some instances. Our walls are pretty thin, so we can hear everything.

Last Monday, folks were hanging out in the alley between our buildings smoking and talking and laughing at 11:30 at night until 1am. I asked them to keep it down and they apologized, but continued on. I had to turn on white noise and use ear plugs to fall asleep.

I’ve contacted our property manager and they connected me to the company that manages their Airbnbs. They sent me $50 for my trouble and I’ve tried to deal with it and ignore.

Again, last night at 2am, an argument broke out amongst the guests after they had gone out for one of the guests birthdays (yes, I could hear everything!!!) I had to go out several times between 2 and 3am to ask them to quiet down. I also emailed the Airbnb manager with videos. I ultimately decided to stop going out since it almost felt like I was escalating and worried it could go violent at some points. Two cars were speeding in and out of the alley with people yelling out the windows.

My questions are: 
- is there anything I can do further with the property manager or Airbnb company? Can I file a formal complaint? I know Chicago has been great for tenants’ rights, but is there anything specific towards short term rentals I should look out for?
- obviously will be more thorough in vetting places I live, but can I ask apartments about Airbnbs in the building? Not sure if I’m even allowed to ask for that info.
- what can I do outside of calling the police for what’s ultimately a noise complaint to try and tamper these instances from happening? I prefer not to call police especially with their known history of being less than useful.

We’ve also had some issues of packages being opening/stolen, a car break-in, nd a break-in on the first floor while my neighbor was at home. I’m really saddened by this as the neighborhood itself seemed really family oriented and safe. I understand crime can happen anywhere and I’m lucky that these are relatively minor offenses.

FWIW, I’ve lived in Dorchester in Boston and Miami so it’s not that I’m not used to areas that are less than savory.

Every other weekend there are guests that stay in those apartments, but regularly stay up late, well past midnight in some instances. Our walls are pretty thin, so we can hear everything.

First time trip to Chicago. Is the sky deck/360 Chicago a must do?,"I have 3 days (Sept 13th-16th) booked for a solo birthday trip and I’m staying at the Freehand. It’ll be tight but I had ChatGPT plan out a trip for me. I had been excited about people’s (old) Reddit recommendations for the Hancock building “free” views until I realized it closed. So I was wondering if the sky deck or 360 Chicago was even worth it to try and fit in this schedule? Also what do yall think about my itinerary?

⸻

📅 Saturday, Sept 13 — Arrival + Downtown Highlights
	
•	12:30 pm — Land, grab your bags, check in to hotel (assuming downtown area).
	
•	2:00 pm — Head to Millennium Park to see Cloud Gate (“The Bean”) and stroll around the park’s gardens and fountains.
	
•	3:30 pm — Walk to the Art Institute of Chicago (closes at 5 pm) — focus on the Impressionist collection, American Gothic, and modern wing.
	
•	5:15 pm — Quick freshen up at hotel.
	
•	6:30 pm — Dinner at Lou Malnati’s (I’d book ahead for a downtown location to avoid the line).
	
•	Evening option — If you’re still energized, walk the Chicago Riverwalk for nighttime city views.

⸻

📅 Sunday, Sept 14 — Wrigleyville + Pilsen Option
	
•	Morning — Breakfast near your hotel, then head to Wrigley Field early to explore the neighborhood.
	
•	Cubs game — Depending on game time (likely early afternoon), soak up the atmosphere — grab a ballpark snack or Old Style beer.
	
•	Post-game — If you have time/energy, hop over to Pilsen for murals, galleries, and Mexican food/snacks (it’s a 25–30 min train ride from Wrigley).
	
•	Dinner — Either eat in Pilsen or head back downtown for something lighter after the big lunch at the park.

⸻

📅 Monday, Sept 15 — Riverboat + Museum of Science and Industry
	
•	9:30 am — Arrive for your 10 am Architecture Riverboat Tour (plan to be there early for boarding).
	
•	11:30 am — Grab a quick lunch downtown or near the museum.
	
•	Afternoon — Head to the Museum of Science and Industry (huge museum — highlights include the U-505 submarine, coal mine, and the science storms exhibit).
	
•	Evening — Dinner in Hyde Park or return downtown; possible last stroll by Navy Pier or Buckingham Fountain for night skyline views.

⸻

📅 Tuesday, Sept 16 — Departure
	
•	Early — Depending on your hotel and time, maybe a quick coffee and pastry before heading to the airport.
	
•	10:30 am — Flight out.

⸻

If you want, I can also give you transit tips and walking routes so you can efficiently connect all these spots without wasting time. That’ll make the plan airtight.

Now, first thing I want to tackle is finding an apartment. I'll say i have been super overwhelmed by all the neighborhoods that are in the city! I am going to be living alone, have two cats and a car. Looking for a 1bd with Washer/Dryer in-unit or in-building, and a little updated appliances. I think modern apartment is a want not a need so I can compromise on that. I definitely want a safe neighborhood as I love walking outside!

Can you please let me know some neighborhoods I should be looking at? My budget for an apartment is $2000-$2200.",['Fulton Market'],['alone'],1,Positive/Reassuring,0.896
Chicago with a reactive dog - is it possible?,"Hello!

I have long considered moving to the area. I recently quit my job so it’s looking like relocation is in my near future. As I’m considering options, I need some advice about life with my reactive Australian Cattle Dog as I’m pretty skeptical about Chicago being a good fit. 

My dog is a rescue, he came to the shelter as a stray so nothing is known about his past life except that he already had a back leg amputated. He was very unhappy at the shelter and exhibited a lot of barrier aggression and some resource guarding which we pretty much worked through for the most part. However, it was very clear immediately that he likely lost his leg in a car accident because he wants to run head first at them! He’s come a long way, but still has slip ups and does get stressed in very busy areas. 

Another issues is his fear of strangers and other dogs, very close passing is not doable. Especially with other dogs. We do walk around occasionally in busy areas like parks with a muzzle and he does okay. And honestly when people see the muzzle they usually give us space :) 

Given our situation, I’d prefer to live further away. I we stayed a few days in Berwyn and were able to manage fine on walks and even went to the park (but it was soooo cold so that likely made it much quieter than usual) BUT my partner wants to live in the city. 

He says we can find a place that meets our needs, but I have walked a friends dog in Pilsen and West Town and we constantly pass dogs and people in close proximity. I am also the person who does most of the walking and all of the training … so I am a lot more nervous about being to give our guy a good quality of life and keep everyone happy and safe. I would just hate to make his reactivity worse with repeated exposure that’s over his threshold. 

Minimally we would need just a block or two that is quiet. At the very least I need to be able to quickly cross the street or pull off the sidewalk to make space for people to pass. Ideally, we’d have a small yard where he can play with his herding ball. He has a lot of energy, but is just fine with a few daily slow pace walks and tons of indoor enrichment and playing though. I’m sure a yard is a pipe dream lol. 

So… does such a place exist anywhere in Chicago? Any recommendations on which neighborhoods to check out next time we come through? If anyone specifically has experience with reactive dogs in a city I would much appreciate your input. TIA!!!!

"How viable is moving to ""downtown"" Chicago on a $40k salary?","Basically the title, from both a rent-specific and cost-of-living perspective. I'm looking to move to Chicago later this summer, wondering if I can make this work or if I should look at other cities.

Reverse Commute to Hoffman Estates?,"I recently accepted a job offer in Hoffman Estates and will be moving to Chicago from Ohio in the next month or so. I'm set on living in the city as I want to experience that lifestyle and thats where the majority of my Chicago friends are. I am currently apartment hunting, was just in town to tour some spots, and wanted to get some more insight from y'all on how the neighborhood I choose might impact my reverse commute.

So heres my situation. I toured a great unit in Wicker/Bucktown 5 minutes from an I-90 on ramp. It's checking almost all the boxes for my situation, but long story short, I talked to the landlord and there were a few applications that rolled in before mine and it seems like someone else is most likely going to get the unit. The only other places I toured that would work for me are in Lake View and Uptown, but I understand that would make my commute longer. So now I'm torn between scheduling some virtual tours in Wicker/Bucktown or just going with one of the units in Lake View/Uptown.

I wouldn't have to be in Chicago until late Jan, but I would love to be moved in by the end of 2025. With that being said, I don't really want to extend my search and/or risk one of these units that I like in Lake View/Uptown getting snatched. But if living in those areas is going to add significant time to my commute, I would be willing to keep looking.

**Does anyone have any insight on how much time living in Uptown/Lake View would add to my commute vs. living around Wicker? I don't really know anyone who is making this long of a commute, so if you are in a similar boat as me, I would love to hear your experience as well. Appreciate any insight!**

Some additional context is my job is hybrid (T-TH in office) and the company is looking to relocate the office into the city in 2026, so would only have to thug it out for a year at most.

(New to Chicago!) Safest neighborhoods w/ good management for &lt;30-min non-driving commute to Fulton Market?,"Hi everyone,

My spouse and I are moving to Chicago and I'll be working at 400 N Aberdeen St in Fulton Market. We're looking for a 1-2 bedroom apartment where our top priorities are safety and good management.

We've already toured a few buildings, but after speaking with current residents, we were advised against them due to issues with the management. So, finding a place with a responsive management company and respectful neighbors is now at the top of our list.

We are set on not driving to work. My car got sideswiped on our second day here, and I'd rather avoid dealing with the traffic and the... creative driving maneuvers people do in the city. We're looking for neighborhoods with a maximum \~30-minute commute (during peak office hours like Tuesday 8:30 am) by walking, biking, or public transit

My spouse and I are moving to Chicago and I'll be working at 400 N Aberdeen St in Fulton Market. We're looking for a 1-2 bedroom apartment where our top priorities are safety and good management.

We've already toured a few buildings, but after speaking with current residents, we were advised against them due to issues with the management. So, finding a place with a responsive management company and respectful neighbors is now at the top of our list.

We are set on not driving to work. My car got sideswiped on our second day here, and I'd rather avoid dealing with the traffic and the... creative driving maneuvers people do in the city. We're looking for neighborhoods with a maximum \~30-minute commute (during peak office hours like Tuesday 8:30 am) by walking, biking, or public transit

Thoughts on needing a car in the city,"Hello r/AskChicago

I’m looking for some advice and wisdom about my current dilemma: my car is old and on its last leg, and I’ve been planning on getting a new one before making the move out there. But I’m starting to reconsider if that’s even necessary. 

I’m planning on moving out to the city in about a month.  I’m from out of state but my partner is local (kinda, she’s in west burbs right now). We’re going to be living in the Logan square / Humboldt park area. I know the area isn’t the safest, but also not particularly dangerous. I’m pretty street smart and I don’t make problems for myself, but I do respect that Chicago is a big city and things can happen.

We wouldn’t have any parking access besides street parking, which I’ve been told is pretty standard for the area we’re moving into, it’s not abundant but not a nightmare. I’ll be fully work from home remote, so I wouldn’t have a commute. I don’t typically drive very often and like to walk or take public transportation as often as possible. And my partner has an old car too, so we would be able to share hers in a pinch. But I am unsure if I’d be able to utilize the metra and other bus options well and safe enough to justify not having a car. 


So Please, let me know what your thoughts on my situation are.

Re: Am I going to freeze to death visiting this weekend?,"Hey all! Wanted to follow up and say thanks to all those who helped me plan and warn us about our first trip to Chicago despite the cold weather. Wanted to post what we did and how we managed:

Friday: leggings/tights and jeans on bottom with a sweater and puffer and beanie on top. We planned to most of our walking today. 

Walked to do rite for breakfast and grabbed a breakfast sammie and their seasonal donuts (gingerbread and peppermint). You need to get the gingerbread ASAP.

Walked Mag Mile from the roastery down to Millennium Park and just walked around some blocks and hotels before our reservation at Cindy's. Got the burger, so good. Then did some ice skating and did the Christmas market. Got some gingerbread cookies and got coco and walked back to the hotel to decompress and power nap before we went to the zoo lights but didn't end up going because we were pooped. Stayed in and walked by Eataly for a quick bite

Saturday: leggings/tights under joggers with our waterproof/hiking pants on, added a balaclava on top.

Yeah it's getting cold. Balaclavas all day. 

Walked to Beatrix for breakfast and yeah, totally rocks. Wife did the avo toast and we shared the lemon pancakes. Walked the top 1/3 of mag mile, checked out the Lego store and the malls to warm up. Walked back downtown for our walking tour at the trade building. Did an interior design walking tour with Tours with Mike and it was awesome. Everything was Christmas'ed out! 

After the tour we took the red line to Portillo's in River North. We're from SW Ohio so chilli dogs are our thing and it was so good (despite having beans on it) and the cake shake is otherworldly. Went back to the hotel for a couple hours to relax. Went to Pequod's for dinner (yumm!) and ended the night at the Music Box Theatre for their Christmas sing a long and It's a Wonderful Life. Walking around this area back to the bus was definitely the coldest portion of the trip at like midnight. Wife broke out the hand warmers. Took the L back to the hotel and passed out at 1am.

Sunday: Door dashed Ann Sathers (so good!) to the hotel, packed up, stopped by MSI for the Christmas tree exhibit and headed home. 

We had a great trip and despite the cold manged to get a couple miles in! I'd never taken public transit before so that was cool. The busses and the red line was super nice and clean. The most hazardous part of the trip was the Indiana highway. Not the snow. Just their roads 😅

Did I pick the wrong weekend to visit?,"So I planned an impromptu mom/teenage son overnight trip for this weekend, having never been to Chicago.

EDIT: I'm staying in Lincoln Park for my trip. I am not opposed to traveling for a day-trip. But of course there's so much to see in only 7ish days.

Sorry if there's an FAQ, I can't find it on mobile.

Part of the fun is going there completely blind... but I also know that there's more than I even am aware exists in Chicago. I'm looking for recommendations for night life music. Recommendations for when I go see Lake Michigan (I know it's literally at Chicago, but specific waterfronts?)

I was told I HAVE to take the architecture tour, do you agree?

I love small venue music (jazz, experimental, electronic, anything really) especially at a bar. If there are any symphony or wind ensemble performances, I love those too. I'm easy going, I like fun, but I'm not very much of a partier per se, any shows going on that I can check out?

I love transit and urbanism, and I like cycling recreationally and commuting, but I am not an athlete cyclist. What advice do you have in exploring without a car (I don't plan to rent a car if I don't need to) I have a relatively good walking endurance level and I enjoy it.

I'm of course wanting to try restaurants, but I'm not loaded with cash, so reasonable restaurant prices. (I'll leave that interpretation to you)

I love coffee (original I know) best coffee place that serves 'for here'?

I really would love to see what Chicago is like for the local, grocery stores, book stores, gameshops (card/board games, vidja games, etc.)

I’m moving to Chicago in April. What part of the city should I be looking at?,"
Title. Moving from STL. I lived in Chicago when I was in the military, loved it but I realize it was different living on base and going into the city than living there. That said, I’ve lived in some terrible parts of STL and want to live in a major metro that isn’t awful, in a part of the city with a lot of things to do.

My budget is ~1500/month, and I’ll have a car but be working remote with frequent air travel (2-4 trips per month). I don’t need a huge space (fine with a studio in fact, I have no furniture so less is more!), I’m just looking for something where I can walk or take the train 80% of the time to go do things. I’m fine with longer walks as I already do this for work trips in cities that allow it or require it for a week or so at a time. 

Where do you guys recommend? I’ve been looking at streeterville and the Gold Coast.

I don’t go out for night life a ton, but it is convenient living in those areas for when I do.

I don’t need a huge space (fine with a studio in fact, I have no furniture so less is more!), I’m just looking for something where I can walk or take the train 80% of the time to go do things. I’m fine with longer walks as I already do this for work trips in cities that allow it or require it for a week or so at a time. 

Where do you guys recommend? I’ve been looking at streeterville and the Gold Coast.

I don’t go out for night life a ton, but it is convenient living in those areas for when I do. Mainly looking for somewhere where criminal shenanigans isn’t heavy on a weeknight basis (dealt with/dealing with that in STL, not scared but would rather just not have the nuisance)","['Gold Coast', 'Streeterville']",['scared'],1,Neutral/Concern,0.464

Is it safe to get the train from O'Hare International Airport?,"Context: I am an Australian, living in Sydney. My sister and her family moved to Chicago last year. The company my dad works for has offices in Chicago, so he gets to visit her every now and again. Sadly I am yet to visit.

My dad just flew in to Chicago to visit my sister (she lives in the northern suburbs near Wrigley Field; they often walk to events at the stadium). When he is there for work the company sends him a taxi, but this time her is there purely to visit the family. He was instructed by my brother in law that under no circumstances to get the train from O'Hare. He mentioned violent crime and homeless people soliciting for funds. He then suggested a taxi from the Airport to their place as (his claim) it is difficult to drive to the airport and arrange a pick up. I was very confused by this suggestion. *""2pm is peak hour"".*

My plan for when I eventually visit was to get the train from O'Hare to Irving Park, then the bus to her place, or purely to tick off a part of my adventure, to get the train into town, then change for the red line and head north. I am of the belief that one of the best ways to get to know a city is via its public transport network.

Seeing as O'Hare is one of the busiest airports in the world, I would have expected a large amount of people travelling to and from the airport every day, meaning a lot of eyes, thus less danger. My brother in law also mentioned that one was required to get a tram from the international terminal to the railway station.

**What are the facts on the ground?**

* Is crime actually an issue on the train? Crime is something I have honestly never throught of when on a train.
* Is there decent frequency to the Airport?
* Are there many homeless people on the trains soliciting for funds?
* Is my BIL just not wanting to pick up dad from the airport?

For context and comparison, at Sydney Kingsford-Smith (SYD) airport, there are two train stations, *Domestic* and *International* respectively. There are 8tph (trains per hour) during most time periods, with 4tph in the late night. It is 10 minutes from Central to Domestic, and 12 minutes to International. The new airport, Western Sydney Nancy-Bird Walton International Airport (WSI) will open in 2027. They are advertising 6tph frequencies on the new trainline under construction, but a requirement to interchange at St Marys to get to Central (51 minutes to Central, 8tph peak, 4tph off peak).",AskChicago,0,1744593671.0,71,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1jyn6yn/is_it_safe_to_get_the_train_from_ohare/,"Is it safe to get the train from O'Hare International Airport?

Living Recommendations for Chicago?,"Hello all,

I (30 M) am moving to Chicago from Boston for work, and would love to hear some recommendations on neighborhoods or areas to live in. I have it narrowed down to a few areas, but would love the community’s opinion, additional recommendations, or thoughts on the vibe of the neighborhoods I’ve shortlisted from my own research. Below are some logistical information and qualities that I value, and am hoping that I can find a place to live that aligns with that. TIA for your help, feel free to DM with recommendations or if you need more details and let me know if there’s another sub I should be putting this in or flairs I should add to garner attention (First time posting on Reddit ever)!



***DETAILS***

**Working Area:** Financial district, hybrid working (Tues-Thurs in office)

**Short list of areas I’ve liked:** Streeterville, West Loop, Lincoln Park, and Wicker Park. One thing I wasn’t sure of was the overall “vibe” of these neighborhoods, so I’d like some insight on that if possible. The activities portion below might help the community with that. Safety of the neighborhoods is high on my priority list as well, though I think all of these are going to be fine.

**Type of space:** 1 bedroom or studio, plan on living alone. More bedrooms is okay if it falls in budget

**Length of stay:** Ideally 2-3 years

**Living budget:** $3000 maximum for rent and utilities total, though less is also acceptable. Parking is not going to be an issue, for the reasons below. May get a bike, but that depends on what I hear from the sub.

**Travel and logistics:** I plan on leaving my car with my parents as the one they have is old and ready to die at any minute. Because of this, I highly value having things within walking distance (like 5-6 blocks or less). Obviously it wouldn’t be possible to have every one of my needs in walking distance but at least having a grocery store and a gym (if the building doesn’t have one) within walking distance is a must. I’d also like a couple of restaurants or bars/breweries in walking distance, but I can be flexible on that through public transport, ride shares, and biking.

**Activities and interests (AKA need to make friends):** I’m a massive nerd of all things (Warhammer, D&amp;D, anime, video games, board games, you name it) and I’d like to get into intramural or beer league sports (I love volleyball, though only beach or sandy volleyball) and dance once I move. These activities I’m willing to take public transport or Uber too, though walking distance would be preferable. Other than that, I also love all the standard things people love (food of all cultures, great cocktails, pets). I’m also single and would love a neighborhood where I can meet people to start a relationship with, though that’s what I hope the activities will help with.

What's the best Chinese delivery around Andersonville?,"I almost never get delivery. I don't use postmates or DoorDash or grubhub, so I don't even know where to start.

Anyone make the move to Chicago from Austin? How has it been?,"Please don't hate me for adding another ""moving to chicago"" type post to the sub.

I've lived in Austin for 8 years and Texas for all my life. After a recent break up with my partner of 7 years, I think it's finally about time I get out of here. I'm looking to live somewhere more urban, walkable, and as a queer person more LGBTQ+ friendly.

Has anyone here had experience moving from Austin to Chicago? I'm curious to hear your pros/cons between the two cities -- especially around cost of living, weather, and meeting new people. I would be moving alone. Is Chicago a difficult place to make community as a 30 year old? I know some cities like Seattle have a reputation for being difficult to break into social circles.

And yes, I know it will be cold! Austin summers make me depressed so I'm (perhaps naively) expecting the Chicago weather to be a welcome change of pace.

Thanks!

What are some ideas/suggestions for a Chicago staycation?,"Hi everyone,

I have some expiring PTO (5 days) that I need to use by the end of July. I was thinking about going in a solo vacation to LA, and while that completely isn’t off the table I am working on a tight budget and know deep down that I should avoid it despite wanting to explore (never really traveled much growing up). Another thing is that I would most likely be solo since my friends are either busy/not interested. With that being said, I am open to suggestions on what to do during this time off.

A little about myself is that I have grown up in the south suburbs my entire life. I’ve been to Chicago many times, shit I’m there 5 days a week bc of work. I haven’t really explored a whole lot tho. I’ve done the basic stuff growing up (Sears Tower, Navy Pier, Museums, etc). Now that I am older, I am thinking about visiting different neighborhoods and areas outside of the loop. 

I enjoy sports, but don’t necessarily want to go to Wrigley or see the White Sox play (I’ve done that plenty of times). I really want to try new restaurants and cafes (nothing upscale, but restaurants that are “heavily” acclaimed for a reasonable price (i.e. Au Cheval)). I like music and nightlife, but at the same time I am more introverted and feel a little intimidated going to bars by myself when others are typically in groups. The beaches are nice but we are having a company outing to the beach next week. Lastly, I enjoy history but don’t want to spend much money doing so museums might be out of the question (unless if some are free or are fairly cheap). 

With all that being said, what are some suggestions you would recommend? Anything works, could be restaurants, events, or even traveling out of state and visiting cities such as Milwaukee.

"Any advice on where to live in January for grad school that is in the loop, if it’s only 1 year?","Hi!
I am relocating in January, but I won’t be able to visit until December for only a few days, so I am trying to do research on areas in advance to maximize my short time there.
I am relocating for grad school, and it’s a 1-year program that I need to be close to the Loop for. I don’t want to be IN the Loop, so I’ve been looking at Streeterville.
My partner and I don’t drink or party, so River North seemed a bit too wild. Since I’m coming in January and it’s going to be a quick and brutal adjustment to the cold, I figured staying close to the train and just accepting the Uber ride at night if I have to would be best.
We wouldn’t bring a car, so that works out fine.
Since we have a cat, I would like to avoid radiator heating or electric heating instead. I’m not sure and just based on my research, that’s what I’m gathering. We are looking at $2,400-2,700 for rent, which I feel is obtainable in January based on what I see currently in the market.
I’m not sold on Streeterville, but the proximity to school for a year might just win out.

Repatriating After 15 Years Abroad- With Korean Husband - Where and How to Start?,"Hi All,

Thanks for your advice and opinions on my lengthy post. VERY LONG LONG LONG POST AHEAD.

I’m American, previously lived in Midtown Atlanta in my 20s before moving to Seoul 15 years ago. My husband and I (married 1.5 years, together 8) are getting his spouse visa approved now and will be done and moving end of March 2026. I’m 41, he’s 34.

We have chosen your fine city after a lot of research and comparison shopping haha. My husband wants us to go somewhere totally new for both of us and start off on equal footing in a new place together. 

We love the cold weather (so does our Shiba), like the idea of living in the gayborhood (Lake View or Lake View East). My husband doesn’t drive so there’s excellent transit, close to the lake for our dog, and nightlife. 

We plan to visit in October this year to scope out some neighborhoods. 

Based on our research - it seems that Lakeview, Andersonville, and Wicker Park are the best areas overall for us? We def like to have nightlife options around. Don’t wannna be totally quiet. 

We live in Gangnam here now, and we don’t need the high rises and office crowds lol enough of that here.

The rental process - it seems that in Lakeview, most apartments are smaller low rise buildings run by property management companies. Any of them particularly good? I’ve done a search and seen the ones to avoid haha.

We will have cash ready for one year or slightly less rent up front - and I have credit hovering around 800.

Jobs for ME - I have a marketing background, but that was 15 years ago. I did create three of my business here, though. 

REAL ESTATE AGENTS - I’m considering doing my studies now so I can take the test when I arrive and have a skill ready to roll. Anyone here have any advice about that job market??

Any local job sites to recommend? I’m so far out of that loop lol. Able to start now that our interview is coming for sure. I’m planning on looking for service jobs as well for immediate cash and I can still teach online.

***Has anyone else been in our shoes? Big move and immigration to Chicago?***

I know this post seems kind of general, but just ready to get the ball rolling and start putting feelers out and hopefully connect with some of you!

Tips for wife + 2 yr old exploring Chicago?,"Hey everyone, European here. I’ll be in Chicago next week for business, and my wife and our 2 yr old daughter are coming along. While I’m working, they’ll be out exploring the city, so I wanted to ask for some tips. We’ll stay at the Marriott Mag Mile, so I imagine there’s plenty of shopping and dining around. A few questions:

Are there any areas they should avoid for safety? They’ll only be out during the day.

Is subway safe and stroller-friendly?

They’ve already planned to visit the Riverwalk, Navy Pier, Aquarium, and Millennium / Maggie Daley Park. Any other recommendations?

Any other tips, especially from parents who’ve done Chicago with a toddler?

I know I’m asking a lot about safety, but this will be their first time exploring a new city without me, so just want to make sure they have a smooth experience.

Where to live for young family: South Loop or Hyde Park?,"Hello,

I am moving to Chicago with my wife and nearly.4 year old son. We are Canadian. My wife and I are medical trainees and will both be working at UChicago Medical Center for 2 years.

\-I was wondering what would be the safest area to live in. I keep hearing that you need to avoid the South end of Chicago. Where is that exactly?

\-We were interested in Hyde Park because it's close to the hospital and it looks nice, almost suburban, and the rent is cheaper. But we have heard some anecdotes that it's close to some shady areas.

\-South Loop seems to be a popular area for medical residents, but it is expensive and somewhat urban looking. However, we did find a nice school there for our son and some nice apartments/townhouses.

We are probably leaning toward South Loop because it seems safer, which is really our priority, but I was just hoping to have some insight from locals.

Thank you.

EDIT: Thank you all for your input. Hyde Park sounds like the winner for young families. The only problem is that we've been having trouble finding a school that can readily accept him there.

"Coming to Chicago, have some questions","Hi people of Chicago,

I posted this in the regular Chicago subreddit but i guess it's more suitable here.

I'm coming to visit your town in November for a conference (KubeCon) and i have been doing some research on what to see and do while there. Have found a few interesting sites and such but i hope you could provide some more hints and tips for me :-)

I will be mostly in central Chicago since the conference is at McCormick Place and my hotel is in the South Loop area. I have around 3 days for doing touristy stuff.

* What sights and places should i not miss ? I plan to see the area around DuSable Bridge and the parks south of Randolph St. Willis Tower is probably something i will go up in and the Museum of Science and Industry is on the list. Maybe the Art Institute as well. Anything else ?
* Since i like sports i managed to get a ticket to see the Blackhawks play New Jersey Devils in United Center. How far in advance is recommended to be at the arena ? What's there to see around United Center ? What's the best way of getting there and back ? I would assume the traffic situation could could be problematic when everyone leaves the arena...
* I have also planned to do some shopping. Mostly clothes probably so any recommended places in the central parts ? If there are any great places further away there's always Uber and such. I prefer outlets if possible since the exchange rate for dollars right now isn't in my favor at all.... In my previous visits to the US i have always liked Ross and i know there is one on W Randolph Street.
* Any good restaurants i should visit ? Or bars that serve craft beer (locally brewed)?
* Any particular areas and similar to avoid other than being generally cautious ?

Planning Exploratory Visit,"My wife and I visited last February for a weekend and we loved the city, now of course we are considering moving there if things work out job wise.  

In the next few weeks we want to visit for 3-4 days and really try to scope out the neighborhoods, as opposed to hitting up the more touristy areas. Basically we want to see the city and what the day-to-day pace is like. We plan to ride the L during rush hour to get an idea of how long it takes to get places and what the crowds are like, scope out area grocery stores, parks, etc. All things that would be good to know for moving to a neighborhood.

At the moment we are looking at areas where we could score a 1B for under $1300, cheaper the better of course. We would consider studio if it was a good size, but we have two cats so a tiny studio won't work for us. 

On our last visit and likely for this one as well we are staying in Wicker Park, which for better or worse seems to be the hipster capital of the city. We want to explorer Wicker Park/Logan Square and the sounding areas. While a bit hipstery we like it as a good starting point for living in Chicago, not super expensive, close to lots of food and drink, on the Blue Line, etc.  

It looks like the farther west you go from Wicker/Logan Square the seedier the area gets, is there any specific cutoff where we should not consider areas past X street? Any tips for areas within those neighborhoods that are good/bad?

Rogers Park and Edgewater seem promising from what I've read here, but we didn't get that far north on our last visit. Any recommended starting places for exploring up that way?

I've also heard Oak Park is nice, how does that compare to the Logan Square / Wicker Park area? Is it more suburb like or still pretty urban? 


Lastly are there any areas we should avoid all together as two out of town people wandering through neighborhoods? Obviously we shouldn't Stroll through Austin in the middle of the night, but are there any specific areas that we are better off keeping away from?

Questions About Ukrainian Village,"Hey everyone,

My fiancé and I just moved from the suburbs into Ukrainian Village. We're by cross streets Western and Chicago, and we love our block/apartment. We haven't really ventured out into the neighborhood and started to explore yet, other than getting some gelato at Black Dog. This is my first time living in a big city (having spent the last 5 years in undergrad in a small college town) and I'm loving Chicago so far. 

Anyway, I was just wondering if any locals in the neighborhood had any tips about the area or advice, and/or could recommend any places nearby that are worth visiting whether they are bars/stores/restaurants etc. On the flip side, what places should I avoid? We are both in our mid twenties.

We also have a dog, can anyone recommend any pet-friendly places nearby, as well as a veterinarian? 

And finally, as someone new to the city of Chicago, can you offer any tips other than the usual tips people offer in the other ""new to the city"" threads?

This is my first time living in a big city (having spent the last 5 years in undergrad in a small college town) and I'm loving Chicago so far. 

Anyway, I was just wondering if any locals in the neighborhood had any tips about the area or advice, and/or could recommend any places nearby that are worth visiting whether they are bars/stores/restaurants etc. On the flip side, what places should I avoid? We are both in our mid twenties.

We also have a dog, can anyone recommend any pet-friendly places nearby, as well as a veterinarian? 

And finally, as someone new to the city of Chicago, can you offer any tips other than the usual tips people offer in the other ""new to the city"" threads?

Bars with no cover on NYE?,"Hi guys,

This year for NYE I was thinking to avoid the formal NYE parties that cost like $100 pp. Instead I'm planning to meet up with some friends at an apartment for the countdown &amp; pre-game and then head out to a bar like normal afterwards. 

So my question is this - do you all know any bars that will be open on NYE but not doing any traditional party? Preferably in the west loop, south loop, river north, Logan square, and wicker park neighborhoods.

In between Medical District and Near West Side/United Center?,"Hello /r/chicago,

I'm going to be moving into the city sometime this summer with some friends and we were looking at apartments and found a view good deals in some areas I was wondering if anyone on here could give me some insight on.

The area is best described as being sandwiched in between Near West Side and the Medical District, along the blue line. I also know to stay East of Western. I was looking at some apartments right north of Eisenhower, somewhere between Oakley and Loomis, on VanBuren.

Just wanted to see how people would weigh in on the area, since I'm finding it hard to judge since it's smack dab between two locales.

Also, before you say it, I understand crime is everywhere and that if you use common sense you can avoid it.

Question about how Chicagoans view UChicago,"Hey /r/Chicago,

I'm a high school senior from the east coast who will be attending the University of Chicago in the fall. Since being admitted in winter, I've casually come to this sub to see what goes on in my future home. 

I visited Chicago for the first time this past week and was absolutely blown away by everything. I love Hyde Park's suburban feel, along with its proximity to the Loop. Chicago feels like a great city for young people. Probably my favorite so far.

Something I wondered when I was away from UChicago's campus and around the loop area was how actually Chicagoans perceive the University and its students.

Do you guys think we are a bunch of pretentious snobs?

How many of the young people living around the loop went to Uchicago? (rough estimates of course)

Do Chicagoans who have never been associated with the University take pride in having a prestigious university with the city's name in it? 

Do you guys even care about the University at all?

Basically anything you have to say about the University's relations with city folk I want to hear!

All the best. 

Edit: One last question I had when I was driving through the rougher neighborhood W of campus: How do the inner city people in southside feel about having this university nearby. A fine university that almost no kids from the rough neighborhoods near it will attend. And a general request - do you have any suggestions of books/movies/tv shows to consume to better understand the rougher parts of S Side life/inner city in general. I know the University is its own secluded world and not very dangerous at all, but I want to learn more just out of pure interest and lack of current knowledge.

Moving to Chicago from out of state: HELP!,"Hey guys, 

I am moving to Chicago from Arizona (I know, I know...) here in the next couple weeks for a new job in River North. Since I have never lived in a big city like this, I am a little nervous and have a ton of questions about moving, living, costs, safety, cars, etc...

-----------------------------------------------
**Information:**

I am 24 years old, wife is 26. We have a young puppy (1 year and 1 month) who needs a lot of exercise (Jack Russell - so possibly looking at areas near a park). As far as what we are looking for kind of varies. We are not huge into partying, but we do like going and checking out different events whether they are drinking related (beer festivals), farmers markets, museums, concerts, etc... We really like a lot of the local restaurants in our area currently (think high review semi-cheap places on Yelp). We currently are living in a 1Br1Ba apartment and are perfectly content with finding something similar in Chicago. 

We are looking for some sort of neighborhood that matches all of these things as much as possible (with decent ability to get to public transportation)

----------------------------------------------------

**Living:**

Based on our information, do you guys have any recommendations for neighborhoods? Which neighborhoods match us and for what reasons? 

We are planning on renting an Airbnb for the first 2ish weeks to get a lay of the land. Any locations we should avoid or check out immediately?

------------------------------------------------------

**Costs:**

What should we watch out for? Currently we are paying about 20% for rent, but will most likely be paying 25-30% for rent here in Chicago. Will this have a huge impact on standard of living, or is this just kind of offset in other areas?

------------------------------------------------------

**Car:**

The wife and I are planning on bringing a car (paid off) however most places we look warn against it. The primary use for the car would be travelling out of state to visit nearby areas for vacations here and there. What do you guys think about this? Is parking something that is pricy everywhere in Chicago or just downtown?

------------------------------------------------------

**Safety:** 

I know this section is probably controversial, because we hear about it all on the news. I know it's not as bad as it is made out to be but what are areas we should avoid looking for housing due to safety reasons?

First time apartment hunting. Where to start?,"My fiance and I would like to move to Chicago. We both love the city and it's kind of close to home.

I also am very familiar with Chicago's neighborhoods and my only conditions are that is has to be close to a bus (if not in walking distance from work), in a nice and safe area, and not far from downtown for when we do transfer to community college. My favorite area is lincoln park and I am definitely trying to avoid the south, way north and west. Thanks so much!",['Lincoln Park'],['avoid'],1,Neutral/Concern,0.457

How dangerous is the Wilson stop? ,"I currently live in Rogers Park (north of Loyola, east of Sheridan) and have lived here or in north Edgewater for about 10 years. My boyfriend and I have been looking at apartments elsewhere recently, and found one that we love about a block east of the Wilson red line stop (it's on Kenmore about half a block north of Wilson.) There is secured underground parking at the building, and most of the time I drive, but my only concern with moving here is walking to and from the Wilson stop, especially at night, by myself. Also, I have a dog, so walking him at night by myself would also be a concern, although the area where the apartment is seems drastically more residential than a block over on Broadway. 

I'm not unfamiliar with the area, I just don't have the familiarity that comes with living there, obviously. Any insight, especially from other females, would be helpful!

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the helpful responses. Someone else beat us to the apartment application so for the moment, it's a moot point.

About Chicago's climate change lawsuit against the oil companies...,"TLDR at the top cause this is gonna be a bit in depth:

1. Climate change costs Chicago a ton of money.

2. Corporations use emotionally charged issues, like ""the CTA sucks,"" to make attacks against them ""controversial."" 

3. And by the way, Chicago would have more money to spend on the CTA if it wasn't spending so much on the side effects of climate change.

Now the long bit:

Back in 1995, I was confused by the sudden appearance of parked white tractor trailers on my way to work every morning.

Turned out they were full of bodies. The morgue couldn't process them fast enough.

[739 people died *in 5 days* from a heatwave.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Chicago_heat_wave) (Yes, climate change was already happening in 1995. This was the first time on record the dew point was high when the heat was.)

So climate change in Chicago is kind of a personal issue for me.

Here's the thing:

Climate change costs the city big bucks. Floods, polar vortexes, heatwaves, etc. [all break shit. Lots of it.](https://studentorgs.kentlaw.iit.edu/ckjeel/2022/10/01/chicago-is-losing-its-duel-with-climate-change/) Expensive infrastructure that needs repairing. 

[Lake Michigan is predicted to be 17"" higher by 2050.](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/great-lakes-water-levels-could-increase-average-75-17-inches-next-few) It's gonna cost a ton to protect the city from that.

Buildings in the loop [are *sinking*.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-silent-hazard-is-sinking-buildings-and-it-will-only-get-worse/) That's an expensive fix.

On a human scale, heatwaves cause [more violence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2023/07/06/heres-why-warm-weather-causes-more-violent-crimes-from-mass-shootings-to-aggravated-assault/). More migrants [(or as Shell Oil called them *in the 1991* ""greenhouse refugees."")](https://youtu.be/0VOWi8oVXmo?feature=shared&amp;t=662) More need for heat-smoke-cold shelters.

This all costs money. 

Which leaves *less* for fixing stuff like the CTA.

One thing struck me about yesterday's post and the way it was instantly diverted to a discussion of the CTA: that jujitsu move of making the issue controversial by changing what it's about. It's an old tobacco industry tactic.

Use emotionally charged issues as diversionary tools to make laws and lawsuits controversial.

So when an office indoor smoking ban is proposed, you lean into a  [polarizing class war about rank](https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=kzlw0051) between the higher ups with private offices (who could presumably smoke) against the grunts in open air cubicles. *(see page 2)*

The ban on smoking in bars becomes an overreach that will put [""the mom and pop"" bar owner out of business](https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=skdj0053) (we all know how that one went, business got better than ever).

And last, but not least, smoking bans in public places become about [""MY FREEDOM.""](https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=xlcg0128)

That's a discussion of oil companies and financial damage from climate change is transformed into a rant about how bad the CTA is and how the mayor's priorities are all screwed up, so everyone agrees the lawsuit is stupid.

So next time someone tries to head fake you into connecting poor CTA service to a new lawsuit or law the city is pursuing:

"Yesterday while walking home from work in the Loop I saw something pretty horrible. A man straight up punched his kid, and the cops did nothing.","So yesterday I left work a little early to take care of something at home. I always walk the few blocks when its decent out. Except this time I saw something pretty disgusting. About a block ahead of me was a family. Mom, dad, and their kid who looked to be about 7 or 8 years old. At first I saw the dad violently shake the kid by the arm. He could barely stand and keep his feet on the ground while the dad whipped him about. This sent all sorts of WTF signals off in my brain. I got smacked as a kid and generally think its not the worst thing in the world, but not great either. This was way, way beyond that. 

So I started following them. About two or three blocks later at Dearborn/Van Buren, the father actually punched him. I called 911 right away and described what was happening. They asked for a description of the dad and kid, where they were at, what direction they were heading, and my name. After giving them the info they said thanks and hung up. I wanted to make sure the cops found them so I continued following them about a block behind. 

After turning the corner and no cops in sight, I called 911 again to let them know where they were. Again the operator gave me the feeling that they really didn't give a shit, but at least this time the family entered a restaurant and would be staying put for the time being. Enough time for the cops to find them. This time, the 911 operator at least took my FULL name and my phone number so they could get ahold of me if need be (although I guess they have callerID so..). 

I waited awhile, probably about 20-30 minutes before a cop showed up. I flagged him down and told him what happened. He also looked like he didn't give a shit and didn't want to be there at all. The cop said he would go in and talk to them. Five minutes later he comes out and heads back to his car. I flag him down again, and again he looks annoyed like he is sick of me. I ask him what happens now and he says ""I talked to them, the kid says he's fine"". The officer got in his car and left.

I've never been more disappointed with society in the 5 or 6 years living in the city. A kid is very clearly abused and the cops do nothing. When you ask a kid who is being abused, of course he's going to say he's fine. He's probably scared shitless that if he says otherwise he'll get the crap beat out of him.

And its not like the kid was a mouthy brat either. He kept his head down and his mouth shut the whole time his dad was nearly beating the shit out of him. If his dad is willing to do that to him walking down the street surrounded by tons of people in rush hour, it just makes me wonder whats happening to him at home.

Thanks to the shitty Chicago police for their excellent services.

edit: No where did I call for them to arrest him out of nowhere. By ""they did nothing"" I mean they didn't even bother to write their contact information down for the report. I can't be certain, but I don't think a report was even written. When I talked to the officer afterward, he said nothing would be done purely because the kid said he ""was ok"".",chicago,13,1333636072.0,28,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/run3s/yesterday_while_walking_home_from_work_in_the/,"Yesterday while walking home from work in the Loop I saw something pretty horrible.

Uptown: violent harasser at Lawrence and Broadway,"[edit: I have been asked to remove a picture of a violent person because it is ""unofficial."" You should be on the lookout for a red-faced leprechaun who will harass you and try to beat you. I'm so glad no one can see his face to call him out about it though.]


On Sunday at about 3:30pm, my partner and I were coming back from the Red Line when we were first harassed, then assaulted by this guy. We were waiting at the light for it to change when this man kept trying to get my attention. After several times, he started yelling homophobic things at us and as the light changed, started to follow us across the street (when this picture was taken). At that point, I told him to go away a few times. After turning around, he picked up a 2x4 from the gutter and came after us. My partner called 911 and was on the phone with the dispatcher. We attempted to duck into the restaurant on the corner, but it was closed. Feeling stuck, I turned around and started yelling at him to get the attention of people around us. He threw the 2x4 at me and scraped my wrist and ran after I continued to yell that he had assaulted me. He ran south to Wilson via the alley.  

An older man flagged down a cop car that happened to pass. They were able to take my statement and file a report, but I predictably haven't heard that he's been arrested. The guy seems like he's a local, if not a corner regular. He's easily prone to violence and seems to really like harassing women.

Need Chicago Apartment Subleasing Advice/Tips,"Just a couple days ago I got an internship in downtown Chicago, river north to be specific, and i'm looking to sublet/rent a place for about 6 weeks starting in mid june.

So i'm wondering what neighborhoods are best, which ones to avoid, and where i might find the safest place for the best price (by safe, I mean the lowest amount of crime in the area). Any general advice for moving to Chicago will be greatly appreciated!

About me: 22 year old male, college graduate, working in advertising. I'm very social and enjoy meeting new people. I definitely enjoy a drink so some nice bars nearby would be fantastic but not necessary. I'd like to live in a neighborhood that has lots of young professionals/older college students. Kind people with a 'neighborly' feel would also be a huge plus. Ideally I would be spending ~$700 for the rent, utilities &amp; parking, but there is some room there if I really like the place.",chicago,0,1401739022.0,7,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/275053/need_chicago_apartment_subleasing_advicetips/,"Need Chicago Apartment Subleasing Advice/Tips Just a couple days ago I got an internship in downtown Chicago, river north to be specific, and i'm looking to sublet/rent a place for about 6 weeks starting in mid june.

Please voice your support for Riot Fest.,"Riot Fest is in danger of leaving Humboldt Park. Alderman Maldonado has stated his position to oppose the festival using the park grounds, while not even mentioning other similar festivals such as the Puerto Rican Fest. This is a blatant attempt to pander to the anti-gentrification element in Humboldt Park, despite the many economic and cultural benefits the festival brings to our neighborhood. I encourage everyone who wants Riot Fest to continue its successful run to write to Alderman Maldonado, the Mayor's office, and local news outlets to help keep this successful event in our neighborhood.

Some ramblings about the CTA after having visited Toronto,"I just spent a week in Toronto and got around entirely on public transportation. I figure Toronto is a good system to compare with the CTA given that the cities in general have a lot in common and are of comparable sizes.

To preface, this isn't just another one of those ""THE CTA SUCKS!!!"" posts, it's me trying to genuinely and in good faith perform a comparison with another similar city. Also this is my impression from one week mainly traveling to tourist destinations in Toronto, not what the average person would be experiencing if they lived there.

* Coverage: The L wins in coverage - the Toronto Subway currently has four lines, and two of them are very short (similar to the Purple and Yellow Lines). 48 route-miles and 75 stations in Toronto vs. 103 route-miles and 145 stations on the L. They are opening Line 5 in Toronto fairly soon which will add another east-west corridor, but the L will still offer significantly better coverage.
* Frequency: Lines 1 and 2 (the main ones) in Toronto both operate with very high frequencies, as frequent as every 2-3 minutes during rush hour, and even during off-peak hours every 5 minutes or so. Even ignoring the current staffing issues, most L lines aren't scheduled to run that frequently, especially not during off-peak hours.
* Layout: The Toronto Subway is similarly hub-and-spoke as the L is. While there isn't a singular focal point analogous to the Loop, there is a circuit bounded by Line 2 between St. George and Yonge and Line 1 making a U shape between those two stations, and four legs branching out from that circuit. They are opening a new east-west light rail line further north relatively soon, which will allow easier travel around the city not via downtown, and I guess the closest analogue to that would be opening an L line along Western or Kedzie or something like that (which I would absolutely love to see happen sometime).
* Elevated vs. underground: The Toronto Subway is almost entirely underground. I imagine this is very nice in the winter, and the heat lamps on the L only help so much (not to mention the wind). It also cuts down on noise from the surface and people living near the tracks (though you can definitely still hear trains from the street). On the other hand, the L being mostly elevated helps you get your bearings for where you are while you travel so you have a better idea of where you are, and of course offers a more interesting ride.
* Cleanliness: Take this with a grain of salt since I was mostly in the downtown area that they probably do more to maintain and probably have some ""grass is greener"" bias here, but the Toronto Subway felt cleaner both on trains in stations. I saw minimal trash out and generally the platforms and trains felt well-maintained. I do hope the CTA ups its game with regards to keeping stations and trains clean.
* Safety: I never rode in Toronto at late nights, and really have never felt unsafe on the L during the day. However there was one case where my train stopped and then bypassed a stop due to a ""security incident"" at Bloor-Yonge.
* Train design: Lines 1 and 4 operate open-gangway trains which are really nice since you can more easily find a less-crowded part of the train. The railcars are also a lot longer and wider than the L cars (75x10 ft in Toronto vs. 48x9 ft in Chicago). I would love to see open-gangway trains in Chicago someday, but I know operating wider/longer railcars isn't really possible due to the platform width and the sharp curves.
* Buses: The TTC bus system (in my *very* limited experience on it in Toronto) felt pretty similar to the CTA buses, but of course I wasn't really relying on it.
* Streetcars: There was a post here a while back lamenting the loss of Chicago's once-large streetcar network. I took the Toronto streetcars a number of times, and other than the ones that operate in reserved medians they are unbelievably slow, probably slower than buses. They also don't have particularly good acceleration, especially uphill. They have more space but are really slow. Also there were some diversions due to construction, and the track layout offers a lot less flexibility in rerouting than it would with a bus. In general I think most of the former streetcar lines are better off as buses, and if we ever do add any new ones they would only work on very high-traffic corridors and need to be in a reserved median with traffic signal priority.
* Airport access: Toronto wins this one by a lot. They have the Union-Pearson Express which for  about CA$10 is able to get me from downtown to the airport 14 miles away (comparable to the distance from downtown Chicago to O'Hare) in 25 minutes, compared to 45-60 on the Blue Line. It mostly runs along GO Transit (commuter rail) tracks, with a spur for the airport and a special platform at Union Station. It would be awesome if we could run some equivalent service to O'Hare via the NCS tracks since the Metra station is now on the ATS, but I know that track is owned by a freight company who doesn't really want more Metra trains running there.
* Commuter rail: Their GO Transit system in general has more frequent service than Metra, and collects fares off-board using a proof-of-payment system (tap your card before boarding and after getting off, and they do random fare inspections). This allows boarding all cars at all stations which is really nice. Toronto Union Station is also a through station, so a lot of inbound trains will just make a brief stop at Union Station and then continue running outbound along another line. The big difference is Toronto is part of the Golden Horseshoe with a number of fairly large cities, while Chicago is (relatively) isolated, so most traffic in Chicago is headed from the suburbs to the city, while in Toronto I would imagine there is a good amount of traffic to places like Mississauga.

UPDATE: Electrified sidewalk in Lincoln Park/Lakeview — NOT resolved!! Need help,"LOCATION: The concrete sidewalk in front of Matisse Tavern and Half Shell, across from Trader Joe’s. Corner of Diversey and Orchard.

TLDR: dogs are still at risk of being electrocuted by the sidewalk on this corner, but the Alderman’s office refuses to block off the sidewalk or investigate any further until another injury occurs. New snow just fell that could cause the sidewalk to begin conducting again, leaving all dogs at risk walking by. Contact 44th alderman to let them know this should be investigated until it’s solved. 


Making this new post because my last one lost engagement and this is very much still a massive issue. The problem remains, so do not walk your dogs there. There’s a previous post on this sub from a couple days ago if you don’t know about this issue already. 

I’ve weirdly put myself in the middle of this because I’m so disappointed by how this has been handled. I’m frustrated to say the least, mostly at the Alderman’s office for their unwillingness to continue investigating.

I’ve been in contact with a lot of people in the last 24 hours (news stations, workers at the Alderman’s office, utility personnel, etc.) to get a resolution here so we can all feel safe on that corner again, especially with our dogs. 

Here’s where we’re at. The Alderman’s office has had 4 different electricians come out to look at the sidewalk. They’ve found nothing wrong, so the Alderman’s office considers the problem “resolved” and has no plans to investigate further… even though they never identified an issue. Apparently electrical problems magically solve themselves now! I can’t wrap my head about a problem being “resolved” without ever doing anything to fix it or identifying anything causing it in the first place. That literally doesn’t make sense. Let’s remember that at least 5 dogs have been electrocuted (excuse me— they’ve been shocked. Some awesome intellectuals in the comments care more about my word choice than the issue at hand.). 

I’ve done extensive research on this to make sense of what happened. From what I can tell, in these fairly common scenarios, there can be issues with frayed wires underground (possibly wires from old infrastructure that no longer exists, although the wires remain live) that usually aren’t an issue - until the sidewalk becomes wet and salty (salt makes water more conductive). So when the electricians were checking it out, I believe the sidewalk was not electrified because the ground was more dry, and they may have missed the problem. 

The sidewalk is completely open and there are no warning signs that this could still be an issue. Nothing stopping this from happening again. I believe there is very much still an issue, it may just be dormant right now. Although a fresh layer of snow just fell, so it could start conducting electricity again. 

I’ve been in contact with the Alderman’s office and they refuse to block the sidewalk or pursue any other action - until there’s another injury. With snow falling tonight and salt reappearing on the sidewalks soon, I think it’s only a matter of time before another dog is electrocuted. (Shocked) 

Someone also said on my last post that this happened to their dog LAST WINTER on this SAME CORNER. This issue is not going anywhere until we know why it’s happening. 

Here’s what we need:
- Contact the alderman’s office. PLEASE. 44th ward. So far they’re only willing to help when a news station is involved. Alderman Tunney said on a news broadcast last night that they would be out there until they got to the bottom of it. As soon as the cameras packed up, they did too! And now his office refuses to investigate further. Let them know that this is a public safety hazard until a cause is identified. Until then, the sidewalk should be blocked to protect our pets and neighbors. Email: ward44@cityofchicago.org and Phone: 773-525-6034
- Alert other dog owners. Seriously, even if you just see dog owners around that area on the street, tell them not to walk their dog there! Trust me, you don’t want this happening again. It’s worth approaching a stranger to give them a heads up. 
- In general, try to use pet friendly ice melt! It doesn’t hurt dog’s paws and it also does not act as a conductor the same way regular rock salt does!! So if issues like this happen anywhere else, it’s less likely to cause serious damage to the dog. 
- If you ever see a dog in extreme distress on sidewalk conditions like these, drag them away from the area. We weren’t sure what was happening at the time, so we kept the dog there on the sidewalk, not knowing the sidewalk was shocking her. This needs to be a more well known issue! 

Please help us to get this resolved and protect our neighborhood pets. I really don’t want to be afraid of seeing a dog electrocuted every time I have to go to Trader Joe’s. I truly cannot believe the Alderman is wiping his hands clean of this without identifying a cause.",chicago,535,1642213223.0,194,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/s49c30/update_electrified_sidewalk_in_lincoln/,"UPDATE: Electrified sidewalk in Lincoln Park/Lakeview — NOT resolved!!

Please help us to get this resolved and protect our neighborhood pets. I really don’t want to be afraid of seeing a dog electrocuted every time I have to go to Trader Joe’s. I truly cannot believe the Alderman is wiping his hands clean of this without identifying a cause.","['Lincoln Park', 'Lakeview']",['afraid'],1,Negative/Fear,0.81
I didn’t think I’d live to 18,"I grew up on the southwest side of Chicago.  When people ask where I come from, I mention the one landmark that immediately comes to mind: the statue of an Indian on the corner of Pulaski and 63rd St. You can see the Indian statue in the movie ‘Wayne’s World’ when Wayne, Garth, and the boys go out on the town, which I always thought was weird since Wayne lived in Aurora (were Wayne and Garth guilty of stolen Chicago valor?).  I also tell people I grew up just outside Marquette Park, which I guess is somewhat famous as Dr. Martin Luther King once led a march through the park and was met with violent opposition.  I also heard that they used to hang black people from the trees in that park, but I was never able to confirm if that was true or not.

I grew up in the 90s and what used to be a neighborhood full of Irish and Italians was almost entirely Mexican. My parents came to the United States from Mexico and though it seems like several lifetimes ago, Spanish was my first language.  I learned to speak English mostly from television (and if we are going to be even more specific, mostly from The Simpsons – a show that still holds a very special place in my heart) as no one in my household spoke a lick of English.  My father provided for my family the best he could working construction and I had a pretty wonderful childhood.  I’d constantly go to the movies with my dad, loved to surf the early web on the family computer, and all-in-all lived a pretty normal life as a kid. 

Outside the home, however, things weren’t so nice.  Gangs were inescapable. Gangbangers have no problem picking on kids walking to school and fights were a regular occurrence.  In their defense, I remember most of those fights being relatively “clean.”  I don’t remember knives, or bats, or guns ever being used during one-on-one fights.  There’d be a violent clash, spectators formed a circle around the combatants, one guy got the better of another, and sometimes the bloody, beaten guy offered his hand, the two shook, and the fight was over.  That was nice, in its own way.  The way men would resolve issues.  There was a primitive decorum that I found respectable.

But it didn’t always end like that.  Not by a long shot.

It was a scorching hot summer day in the break between 7th and 8th grade.  All I really remember about the day itself is that I was enjoying a delicious Sonic the Hedgehog ice cream bar – the kind with gumballs for eyes – and I remember the sun was so oppressive, the heat so all-consuming that poor Sonic was halfway melted a minute after I unwrapped him.  I remember how delicious that blue ice cream tasted, how refreshing the cool ice cream felt as I sat on my front steps.  It was a simpler time when I didn’t need to drink, didn’t need to smoke, didn’t need anything else to keep me content other than that ice cream bar.  That moment encapsulates my innocence.  That would be the day I lost a bit of that innocence.

The sun was beginning to set that day, and as the shadow of night began to envelop the neighborhood, there was an electricity in the air.  It was palpable.  I could almost taste it as well as I tasted that ice cream.  But I didn’t know what was causing it; no one in my family did. But we could all feel it.  We walked from our backyard to the front, and we saw people walking toward my school, which was just a few blocks behind our house.  It was as though something pulled us, and I imagine this is what the rats would feel behind the Pied Piper. So, we followed.

My school was enormous.  It taught children from kindergarten to 8th grade and spanned an entire city block.  It can best be described as a prison mixed with a castle.  We saw the tall, gray walls of my prison come as we drew near and saw that people went to the left side of the building. That side was where the younger kids usually lined up.  It was summer, of course, and even if it wasn’t there wouldn’t be any kids there as it was later in the evening.  No one, really, should have been there at that time of day and that time of year.

We arrived at the corner of the school and we saw one or two police cars.  As I drew near, my eyes scanned all over for what the commotion was about.  The scene was quiet and, at the risk of sounding trite, too quiet.  Then I saw it: at the feet of the police officers was a bicycle that was half-covered with a blanket and by the powers of inference, I knew exactly what was being covered up.  I was pretty close, we all were, and what struck me was how casual the police officers were acting.  Just another day at the office.  Cool as cucumbers, they were.  All things considered, everyone there was acting pretty calm and collected. For a bit.

A car parks on the other side of the street and a man and women came out of the car.  At the time, they looked older but that was from the perception of a kid.  Now that I think of it, those people couldn’t have been more than 40 to 45.  The officers took the couple to the body and lifted the cover.  And then I heard it.  A sound that has stayed with me for 30 years.  The wails of a woman who is looking at her son who was shot dead in the street.  There was a pain in her voice that I felt.  It is a pain that I still feel today.  The father cried too, and I can still hear his echoes, but it is the mother’s cries that cleaved themselves and left an imprint in my mind. 

And then the brother showed up.  He must have been in high school, and he was pretty obviously a banger.  He wasn’t a banger in the shaved head kind of way but in the hair slicked back style, but he had that same aura of bangers that I knew only all too well.  His sorrow erupted but where his parent’s pain was pure sadness and grief, the brother’s was an unrelenting anger, a bloodlust he bellowed out in a growl.  He slammed his fists against the police vehicle and dropped his head.  In any other circumstance, the officers would have reprimanded him for hitting the cruiser, but the calm and collected officers knew better that day.  The dent the kid caused on the cruiser paled in comparison to what this family was going through.

And here we were, the crowd spectators, gawking as if this had anything to do with us.  The show was over, so to speak, and we went back home.  The funny thing is I was there my mom, my dad, my sister, but I don’t remember there being any kind of speech, any kind of lesson to be taken from what we just saw.  What would the lesson be?  Don’t ride your bike around the neighborhood?  Be bulletproof?  I think we just kind of acted as if we saw a play and decided it was best to just move along with our lives.",chicago,769,1737211292.0,75,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1i48xhr/i_didnt_think_id_live_to_18/,"I didn’t think I’d live to 18 I grew up on the southwest side of Chicago.

To the guys watching the woman being assaulted last night,"When somebody yells at you to call the cops, CALL THE COPS.

My friend was assaulted and robbed in the loop (Van Buren near Michigan) last night by a group of black teenagers, both boys and girls. They kept asking her, ""What are you going to do about it?"" while hitting her in the face and head trying to take her backpack.

Fortunately, she thought she could do something about it, because there were two men across the street and she called out to them for help and to call the cops.

Unfortunately, they stood there and did nothing.

I know the psychology behind asking for help in a crowd is disappointing, but if you see something stop being a mindless pedestrian and do something about it. You don't have to be a hero, but calling the cops can help.

Edit: Friend is shook up with bruises and bumps, but ok. Thanks for asking. I'm sure she'll read this post and appreciate your concerns.

Trying to move to Chicago from out of state in May/June - where in Lakeview would be a good spot for me?,"I’m sorry, I know there’s a lot of these posts. My girlfriend and I are moving to IL from out of state. We visited last year, fell in love with it and have some family ties nearby. 

After a lot of thinking on the right neighborhood, we settled on Lakeview East. We can’t visit extensively right now, but heard it’s a really safe/solid choice to spend your first few year in the city, and has basically everything you need. Sold!

I guess now the question is determining where. Honestly, I don’t want to be in the heart of the chaos, (like in the more fratty areas near Wrigleyville - although I love the Cubs!). I’m close to 30 and really value a quiet home life, but within proximity of a vet, restaurants, public transit, etc. I’m not a huge drinker but I like trying new foods, I’d like to be by the lake where there’s more greenery and places to hang out with my dog. I think safety is sort of number one, and just being near a good CTA stop and some good lightning at night. 

I don’t know if that’s a lot to go off of. I work from home and am about $80k ish per year. My girlfriend is a bit more extroverted, it’ll be her first time living in a city. She wants opportunities to make friends and she’ll need transit for work. She’s also expressed a desire to be near some greenery, but also wants to be close by to bars and restaurants. And like I mentioned, we have a small dog so any areas very close by where he can walk around and hang out is good. I think being around people like us is ideal….sort of in between college grads and parents, I guess. 

I know how annoying I must sound here. I guess I’m just struggling. I’m trying to find and avoid the right property managers (Beal), I’m trying to find maybe the best parts of Lakeview for my personality (I think we both value quiet evenings indoors but being in proximity to fun stuff, although we know being in the city = more noise overall, which is fine - mostly just trying to avoid the young 20s party scene). 

Does anyone maybe have any suggestions on parts of the neighborhood that may be good? Streets, realtors, property groups, anything? Honestly any help is appreciated I’ve been going through a lot the past few months and I’ve tried to do as much research as I can, but actually being able to get some more suggestions from people there would be so so helpful

Where can I park in Rogers Park without being towed?,"Help needed--parking around Rogers Park

UPDATE: I went to a currency exchange and got my parking stickers. So easy! Thanks all for your help. 

TLDR I have a car and I need to park it on the street as near to Loyola Ave as possible without getting towed or playing musical cars every 2-4 hours parking and reparking, or paying exorbitant structure fees. I am unwilling to sell my car--long story but an absolute dealbreaker.

Context: 

Hello all, I've just moved to the Loyola area. I love it, I can walk to the lake (!), but parking is such a pain--seems like it's all a tow zone at random hours so you can never be safe. 😂 It was $119 to stay in a structure for 7 days but that's not sustainable.

I've applied for my parking sticker and should hear back within 10 days, but it's the gov so I expect they'll draw out the process for weeks. That's how it is in Michigan, maybe it's better here. In the meantime, is there an area you know of that's safe to park in either all the time or in longer blocks than 2-4 hours? Maybe a side street in a suburbanish area (bearing in mind I'm a petite woman who would be walking alone very late at night at times so can't go too far out of radius). I've heard Devon and Sheridan but from everything I've seen on foot, Sheridan is just as bad as anywhere else. I'll go hunting on Devon later today, but any help would be appreciated.

commute from ogilvie to north chicago?,"I've scoped out the Metra train and it looks like it would be 1 hour 45 minutes total if I'm walking to the station and from the station to my destination. 1 hour 20 minutes if I am riding my bike. 

I do have a car and considered this as well but have heard horror stories about the rush hour traffic. Google says between 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes by car in the morning, 50 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes in the evening. It gets better the closer to 6pm I get. 

  
Which would you do? Are there any alternate routes that avoid traffic coming from west loop to North Chicago?

The Metra sounds nice but looking at videos of the inside it doesn't seem like the greatest place to sit for 1.5 hours. If they had outlets I could plug into that's obviously a game changer because then I could do stuff on my computer to kill time. Alternatively driving has the potential to be a shorter ride (if google maps estimation is correct) but far more boring and will feel longer because I'm driving versus getting work done or reading a book or playing a game. 

  
If I were to drive in the middle of the night to North Chicago, it'd be a 40 minute drive. Zero traffic, I can't make it a shorter commute than that. If I can get my commute close to this guaranteed, that'd be ideal. 

Let me know what y'alls thoughts are on riding the Metra, especially for that long - in comparison to driving instead. Particularly if you know any side streets I could take that would avoid a lot of traffic.

I've scoped out the Metra train and it looks like it would be 1 hour 45 minutes total if I'm walking to the station and from the station to my destination. 1 hour 20 minutes if I am riding my bike. 

I do have a car and considered this as well but have heard horror stories about the rush hour traffic. Google says between 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes by car in the morning, 50 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes in the evening. It gets better the closer to 6pm I get. 

  
Which would you do? Are there any alternate routes that avoid traffic coming from west loop to North Chicago?

Honest thoughts about Bronzeville concerning safety (specifically for women)?,"Edit #1 9/8/25: I added that I read posts in this subreddit from 3-5 ish years ago with similar questions and am wondering if anything has changed since then. I read the neighborhood notes from the subreddit. I am also in a group on Facebook for women based in Chicago and so far a few women said they have enjoyed living there and feel safe. 

Edit #2 9/8/25: Corrected statement about Hyde Park being a 10 minute walk from the house. It is actually a 32 minute walk and a 7 minute car ride and 16 minutes away by public transit. 

Hi! My boyfriend and I are looking to move to buy a house in Bronzeville. The house is about a 7-minute drive to Hyde Park. I’ve read older posts dated a few years ago similar to this one regarding the safety of Bronzeville, and was wondering what your thoughts are and if anything has changed since I read those older posts. 

We have done a little bit of research on the area to evaluate what kind of crime may be present. I would be likely living there by myself to settle in for a few months while my boyfriend moves everything from a different state entirely. I’m wanting to know how safe it is for women to walk around by themselves (while of course following basic safety tips such as not looking completely clueless and not walking around late at night). 

I read that the Green line is alright during the day but that it can get dicey at night. 

Please give your honest feedback about the area. I am new to Chicago aside from having visited a handful of times, and while I do have some general understandings of what areas to avoid, I am especially curious about Bronzeville. My understanding is that Bronzeville has a significant history within Chicago. 

Thank you!

"What time does the L become ""unsafe""? If at all?","Hey everyone - 

  
Traveling to Chicago in June for my bachelor weekend, and was planning on utilizing the L quite a bit. 

We are staying in the Pilsen neighborhood, so the Pink line is going to be our main transport. I have used the L (specifically Pink line) a lot when I travel in for Riot Fest, but have never used it during just a normal weekend. 

So the question is, is there a certain time of night we should consider getting an uber? Or is the L generally safe throughout the night?

My friend just posted again on Facebook about her stolen mini-van, and I just thought I wanted to let the Chicago reddit community know. Not necessarily to be on the lookout (let's face it, it's like a needle in a haystack at this point), but just in case if anyone is curious.

My friend and her daughter went to the carnival tonight at St. Barbara's Church. Her daughter drove with her car and they were parked at the intersection on Lyman &amp; Farrell (one of the small neighborhood streets in Bridgeport near St. Barb's and Palmisano Park). While they were getting into her car, they literally saw her van drive by and pass them up on Lyman. They quickly called 911 and chased after them. I guess they lost track of the van in an alley at 37th and Hermitage.

Good news is that they saw who was driving the van. It was a Hispanic man and Hispanic woman. They got a decent look at their facial features so they reported all of that new information to the police. Again, here are the details from before...

* Stolen between 8pm last night and 11am this morning (June 17) at the intersection between 35th street and Marshfield in the McKinley Park neighborhood
* 2002 Chrysler Town and Country License plate # R499050 light blue almost silver in color, some minor dents and rust.
* It has a soccer ball decal in the back window
* If you see it, please call the police and PM me. She has her phone number on Facebook and the Bridgeport Chicago IL Facebook page, but not sure if she wants me to put it on reddit.

Thinking of moving to Wicker Park and relying on the Blue Line for commuting. Am I nuts?,"34M here, work downtown near Millenium Park (Randolph and Michigan) and currently live in the South Loop.

I am looking at potentially buying a home in Wicker Park near the Divison Blue Line stop. I like the neighborhood for its good and bad aspects, but am hesitant to put in an offer just yet, in part due to all the horror stories I've heard about the Blue Line during rush hour (i.e. the top post in this thread: [Why is the blue line so comically bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/am3chs/why_is_the_blue_line_so_comically_bad/))

On the plus side, my job *is* flexible enough so that I could commute early, like 6-7 AM, and leave work around 3 PM. Would this avoid the worst of the rush?

How fucked is the Divison stop in the morning around ~7AM? I realize this stop might probably be one of the worst, since people don't really start getting off until Chicago, Grand and finally the mass exodus at Clark/Lake.

And coming home at around 3 PM or 4 tops -- would getting on at Washington or even heading down to Monroe be doable?

How much worse is the crowding in the winter vs. the summer at the above mentioned stops?

As a last resort, I could drive if needed; but that seems a bit wasteful. I can also work from home on occasion, like if the Blue Line is just completely down/delayed as I know happens sometimes.

Can we discuss Down-zoning?,"So I live in the Avondale neighborhood right by where the raucous [Alderman Rosa meeting occurred last week] (). My problem is that after reading a variety of articles, and going through some of Rosa's [Community Driven Zoning and Development](http://www.aldermancarlosrosa.org/cdzd)  (it's kinda long),  I can't really get a handle on if if I think Down-zoning is a good idea or a bad one. I'll list the pros and cons as I can see them, though I know I'm missing key parts of the debate (I'll update as more info comes in):

**Pros**

* Lot by lot control of new construction creates opportunity for building better integrated (services and population) neighborhoods

* Possibly protects against over-development and gentrification 

* Preserves quasi-historic aspects of a neighborhood particularly small businesses

* Allows the alderman to cherry pick projects that appeal to their base


**Cons**

* Property owners lose control of how to sell or develop their property (I think this might affect both large developers like Fishman as well as individual property owners ready to ""cash-out""

* Assumes that property rates will continue to increase and development money will always be there

* Assumes the 'character' of the street or neighborhood is worth preserving (the [stretch of Milwaukee in question] (https://chicago.curbed.com/2017/10/12/16464692/milwaukee-avenue-development-downzoning-avondale) is a dump, IMO)

* Assumes that gentrification can be curbed or stopped

* Allows the alderman to cherry pick projects that appeal to their base

* Increases political power of an elected official with little oversight

* Seems to view the problems of the future through the lens of the past.


**Some questions**

* Is gentrification and cultural identity actually the biggest issue we need to worry about? For example, should we be building for better sustainability or specific types of businesses?

* What are the future prospects of the neighborhood or Chicago writ large?

*What types of migration can we expect to see over the next 10-20 years (i.e. more young professionals? more immigrants? more internal migration?)

* What can the tax base support? What are we losing if we don't open the neighborhood up to larger developments?
 


Please, avoid emotionally-charged political rhetoric, I'd like to actually understand the issues. If you have a stake in one side or the other, I think that's important, but not a reason to assume your opinion is morally superior. Be charitable and assume that people have valid, rational opinions that they have thought about. Thanks.

We Have Exactly One Week to Fix the Trump Tower Chicago Fish-Kill Settlement,"After over a decade of knowingly decimating fish in the Chicago River, the Trump Organization has managed to negotiate a surprisingly deficient settlement that benefits itself. But if we push for some simple changes during the public comment period, it could much better serve wildlife and Chicagoans.  
**About me:** I've worked or volunteered for several ecology-focused nonprofits, including one of the two involved in this litigation, but what I'm writing doesn't necessarily reflect the views of any organizations I've been with, even if it very much reflects the views of a whole lot of people within those organizations. I'm not affiliated with LVEJO, which I mention below.

**Background:** When Trump Tower was built 17 years ago, it included an air conditioning system that pulls in water from the Chicago River to help cool the building. Those systems can be ok, but Trump's cut corners in both design and operation. The water it releases is far too hot, but more importantly, the system has been trapping and killing a ridiculous amount of fish and other wildlife ever since it was installed. Seven years ago, the Sierra Club conducted a permit review and then sued the Trump Organization for operating this giant fish-killing machine without a permit. Then last year, a judge finally ruled that the Trump Organization was violating environmental laws. 

Chicago environmental circles expected a settlement where the Trump Organization pays $5 to10 million into an Illinois state trust fund, with the Illinois EPA issuing grants from that fund to improve the health of the Chicago River. But in the proposed settlement that's currently open for public comment, the Trump Org agrees to pay only $4.8 million, with $3 million going to ""restoring the Chicago River habitat for fish and aquatic life."" And 100% of that $3 million is dedicated to projects improving and beautifying the small stretch of downtown river closest to Trump Tower. Many other projects--projects that don't have the funding options that downtown already had--would much better benefit both Chicago River wildlife and the public.

**Problems with the settlement:**

1. It's not enough money.
2. The money could be spent more efficiently to benefit the Chicago River's ecology and Chicagoans--not just the mainstem of the river where Trump Tower is located. 

**What's in the current proposal:** Costs have to be reported to the Illinois EPA, but there isn't much oversight or specificity for what ""restoring the Chicago River habitat for fish and aquatic life"" must look like. It's anticipated that it will be a bunch of bundles of floating logs for turtles to bask on, and submerged structures that hope to attract and provide habitat for fish and other wildlife. There are some questions around whether that type of project is the most beneficial, and big questions around why a project of that type would require all $3 million. But the biggest issue with the project is actually the location. 

**Why the location matters:** At first it may make sense that this money would focus on the part of the Chicago River closest to Trump Tower, since that's where the violations took place. But the first thing to understand is that the Chicago-Calumet River System is a heavily integrated system with few barriers. Once you make it past the electric barriers near Lemont, you are in a system of over 150 miles of heavily connected canals, streams, and rivers without a bunch of significant barriers, like large waterfalls. Fish can, and do, move freely throughout this system during their lifetimes. This was generally understood for a long time, but in the last few years scientists at the Shedd Aquarium have repeatedly confirmed it. Their fish-tracking studies have shown that Chicago River fish frequently make long multi-mile trips along the river system, and sometimes even between the lake and the river. Because of this, improving the habitat for fish in one area can benefit their numbers throughout the system. **In these situations, the most cost-effective improvements are generally ""worst-first,"" meaning the dirtiest areas where toxins are actively leaching out and harming wildlife should be first priority.** 

* The small stretch of river near Trump Tower is less than 1% of the river system, and it's possibly the cleanest stretch of the river already, due to the constant influx of clean lake water into the area. In many other areas of the Chicago River, remediation could have a huge benefit: taking an area that's too toxic for most wildlife due to an industrial past, and transforming it into welcoming productive habitat. You'll never see that kind of improvement in the mainstem, since it's already so clean. 
* This may also be the absolute worst place to put these types of structures in the whole of the Chicago-Calumet River System, due to the risk of future fish entrainment and impingement (the thing Trump Tower is doing now). That's because this downtown stretch of the river is filled with other large buildings with similar air conditioning systems using river water. While none are as dangerous as Trump Tower's has been, they all pose some risk to fish, especially smaller, younger fish. Encouraging fish to spend more time and probably nest/spawn specifically near these baby-fish-killing-machines may not be the best idea, and it'd be better to build these structures literally anywhere else in the river system. 

**What's a better idea?** $3 million could fundamentally improve parts of the Chicago River and those nearby communities. And $3 million could fund multiple projects in different areas that need attention. 

It's hard to say what part of the Chicago River System is in the worst condition right now. At certain points it could have been the area around Goose Island or Bubbly Creek, with their manufactured gas plants and stockyards. But remediation of those places is being actively pursued already, for example by forcing Peoples Gas to fund remediation of their old sites and designating several areas superfund sites. 

In my opinion, the area most in need of remediation is the heavily polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon polluted spur of the river that pokes into the Little Village neighborhood, officially called Collateral Channel. The Little Village Environmental Justice Organization (LVEJO) has been trying for well over a decade to get Collateral Channel remediated. They tried to get MWRD to fix it, since they originally dug the channel. But so far, all LVEJO has been able to do is get some fencing up to protect the neighborhood kids from playing near the toxic waters. LVEJO has a proven track record of spearheading major lasting improvements to the built environment in Little Village, including their recent work at La Villita Park immediately north of Collateral Channel. La Villita Park is great, but in the summer the smell from Collateral Channel drifts over it. 

**To get a sense of what this amount of money can do:** Just $1.5 million would probably be enough to fund clay cap remediation of the Collateral Channel, leaving plenty of money for the kind of biopark and community boat launch they've been trying to get funded for the past decade: [https://www.facebook.com/share/1AiEbxpdzF/](https://www.facebook.com/share/1AiEbxpdzF/) 

**How to fix this settlement proposal:** You can read the proposed settlement and make a comment during the next 7 days here: [https://epa.illinois.gov/public-notices/npdes-settlement-notices.html](https://epa.illinois.gov/public-notices/npdes-settlement-notices.html) We the people are represented by the Illinois Attorney General's office in this case. The AG is required to consider our comments and can withdraw from the settlement and request changes if our comments show this settlement would be ""inappropriate, improper, or inadequate."" If you contact other elected officials or media, it could help put pressure on Kwame Raoul's AG office to change the settlement.

**What should we ask for:** Negotiating a higher payout at this point in the process would be a big ask. Improving how that money is allocated is more likely. Here's what I propose we ask for, and notes on why it matters:

* That the $3 million dollars go to an independent grantmaker like the Illinois EPA or the City of Chicago's River Ecology and Governance Task Force, and that the funds could then be awarded to the project or projects most likely to improve the ecology of the Chicago River System as a whole. 
* The current settlement designating all the money for the mainstem downtown doesn't make any sense from an ecological perspective, and it's especially insulting given that the area already has plenty of options to fund these kinds of projects. For example: Just after Trump Tower was built, $100 million federal loan was all spent improving the riverwalk in the mainstem area around the tower, and that was on top of massive other public and private investments to that small section of the river. Other neighborhoods along our river, like Little Village, don't have those same funding options.
* The Trump family has a long history of repeatedly using money intended to benefit the public or charities on Trump's own properties. Given that context, it's all the more upsetting that this proposed settlement would devote all remediation funding to the areas near Trump Tower. 

Thanks for reading this far, and for caring about Chicago rivers and communities.",chicago,105,1749908196.0,13,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1lb8vuh/we_have_exactly_one_week_to_fix_the_trump_tower/,"We Have Exactly One Week to Fix the Trump Tower Chicago Fish-Kill Settlement After over a decade of knowingly decimating fish in the Chicago River, the Trump Organization has managed to negotiate a surprisingly deficient settlement that benefits itself. But if we push for some simple changes during the public comment period, it could much better serve wildlife and Chicagoans.  
**About me:** I've worked or volunteered for several ecology-focused nonprofits, including one of the two involved in this litigation, but what I'm writing doesn't necessarily reflect the views of any organizations I've been with, even if it very much reflects the views of a whole lot of people within those organizations. I'm not affiliated with LVEJO, which I mention below.

**Background:** When Trump Tower was built 17 years ago, it included an air conditioning system that pulls in water from the Chicago River to help cool the building. Those systems can be ok, but Trump's cut corners in both design and operation. The water it releases is far too hot, but more importantly, the system has been trapping and killing a ridiculous amount of fish and other wildlife ever since it was installed. Seven years ago, the Sierra Club conducted a permit review and then sued the Trump Organization for operating this giant fish-killing machine without a permit. Then last year, a judge finally ruled that the Trump Organization was violating environmental laws. 

Chicago environmental circles expected a settlement where the Trump Organization pays $5 to10 million into an Illinois state trust fund, with the Illinois EPA issuing grants from that fund to improve the health of the Chicago River. But in the proposed settlement that's currently open for public comment, the Trump Org agrees to pay only $4.8 million, with $3 million going to ""restoring the Chicago River habitat for fish and aquatic life."" And 100% of that $3 million is dedicated to projects improving and beautifying the small stretch of downtown river closest to Trump Tower. Many other projects--projects that don't have the funding options that downtown already had--would much better benefit both Chicago River wildlife and the public.

**Problems with the settlement:**

1. It's not enough money.
2. The money could be spent more efficiently to benefit the Chicago River's ecology and Chicagoans--not just the mainstem of the river where Trump Tower is located. 

**What's in the current proposal:** Costs have to be reported to the Illinois EPA, but there isn't much oversight or specificity for what ""restoring the Chicago River habitat for fish and aquatic life"" must look like. It's anticipated that it will be a bunch of bundles of floating logs for turtles to bask on, and submerged structures that hope to attract and provide habitat for fish and other wildlife. There are some questions around whether that type of project is the most beneficial, and big questions around why a project of that type would require all $3 million. But the biggest issue with the project is actually the location. 

**Why the location matters:** At first it may make sense that this money would focus on the part of the Chicago River closest to Trump Tower, since that's where the violations took place. But the first thing to understand is that the Chicago-Calumet River System is a heavily integrated system with few barriers. Once you make it past the electric barriers near Lemont, you are in a system of over 150 miles of heavily connected canals, streams, and rivers without a bunch of significant barriers, like large waterfalls. Fish can, and do, move freely throughout this system during their lifetimes. This was generally understood for a long time, but in the last few years scientists at the Shedd Aquarium have repeatedly confirmed it. Their fish-tracking studies have shown that Chicago River fish frequently make long multi-mile trips along the river system, and sometimes even between the lake and the river. Because of this, improving the habitat for fish in one area can benefit their numbers throughout the system. **In these situations, the most cost-effective improvements are generally ""worst-first,"" meaning the dirtiest areas where toxins are actively leaching out and harming wildlife should be first priority.** 

* The small stretch of river near Trump Tower is less than 1% of the river system, and it's possibly the cleanest stretch of the river already, due to the constant influx of clean lake water into the area. In many other areas of the Chicago River, remediation could have a huge benefit: taking an area that's too toxic for most wildlife due to an industrial past, and transforming it into welcoming productive habitat. You'll never see that kind of improvement in the mainstem, since it's already so clean. 
* This may also be the absolute worst place to put these types of structures in the whole of the Chicago-Calumet River System, due to the risk of future fish entrainment and impingement (the thing Trump Tower is doing now). That's because this downtown stretch of the river is filled with other large buildings with similar air conditioning systems using river water. While none are as dangerous as Trump Tower's has been, they all pose some risk to fish, especially smaller, younger fish. Encouraging fish to spend more time and probably nest/spawn specifically near these baby-fish-killing-machines may not be the best idea, and it'd be better to build these structures literally anywhere else in the river system. 

**What's a better idea?** $3 million could fundamentally improve parts of the Chicago River and those nearby communities. And $3 million could fund multiple projects in different areas that need attention. 

It's hard to say what part of the Chicago River System is in the worst condition right now. At certain points it could have been the area around Goose Island or Bubbly Creek, with their manufactured gas plants and stockyards. But remediation of those places is being actively pursued already, for example by forcing Peoples Gas to fund remediation of their old sites and designating several areas superfund sites. 

In my opinion, the area most in need of remediation is the heavily polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon polluted spur of the river that pokes into the Little Village neighborhood, officially called Collateral Channel. The Little Village Environmental Justice Organization (LVEJO) has been trying for well over a decade to get Collateral Channel remediated. They tried to get MWRD to fix it, since they originally dug the channel. But so far, all LVEJO has been able to do is get some fencing up to protect the neighborhood kids from playing near the toxic waters. LVEJO has a proven track record of spearheading major lasting improvements to the built environment in Little Village, including their recent work at La Villita Park immediately north of Collateral Channel. La Villita Park is great, but in the summer the smell from Collateral Channel drifts over it. 

**To get a sense of what this amount of money can do:** Just $1.5 million would probably be enough to fund clay cap remediation of the Collateral Channel, leaving plenty of money for the kind of biopark and community boat launch they've been trying to get funded for the past decade: [https://www.facebook.com/share/1AiEbxpdzF/](https://www.facebook.com/share/1AiEbxpdzF/)

"Which Chicago neighborhoods would be best for a safe, walkable lifestyle with a great social and dating scene?","Hi!

I'm 27F, remote software engineer moving to Chicago from next year! I’d love some advice on the best neighborhoods to match my lifestyle!

Here's what I'm looking for:

* **Budget**: Up to $2,500/month for rent for a luxury 1 bedroom. I could go to up $2700 too.
* **Lifestyle**: I’d love to live in a high-rise with nice amenities and a professional crowd
* **Social Life**: I don't drink or smoke but would love to meet folks through meetup groups. I wanna explore my interest in writing so maybe I'd join some writing clubs, book clubs, or become a member at a museum. I am extroverted but usually lead a low-key life. Love to eat out and explore coffee shops or any events/markets that opened up for the season. I meditate and workout a lot too so could join groups for those.
* **Dating Scene**: I'm single and would actually love to start dating. Would love to meet guys off the apps (ideally) who are in their late 20s or early to mid 30s
* **Gym**: I'd love proximity to a top tier bodybuilding gym
* **Daily Essentials**: I'm coming from Arlington, VA where I didn't have a car. I can get a car but would ideally like to avoid dealing with maintaining a car in Chicago so walking proximity is essential. Would like to be within 5-10 mins walking distance from grocery stores.

Please let me know what the best month to move is too! Would it be Feb so I can possibly get a better deal on the rent?

I've been considering **Streeterville**, **Gold Coast**, **South Loop**, **Old Town**, and **River North** (with some concerns about the nightlife there). For those who know these areas, would they suit what I’m looking for, or is there another neighborhood I should be considering?

Is auburn Gresham a safe neighborhood?,My mother in law is considering closing on a house in Auburn Gresham. She said it's safe and wants us to come visit. We have 2 kids (2 mo and 2 yo) and based on my findings I would feel troubled bringing them to grandma's house if that is where she chooses to live. Should we try to talk her out of it?

"Asking for advice from Chicago parents, teachers or those who attended Chicago public schools recently (please see comment for details)?","My family is relocating to Chicago within the next two months and we have a 9 year old son who will be going into fourth grade. 

When we’re looking at places to rent and the schools they are zoned for, I’m confused why a neighborhood that is considered “safe” and “good” will have a rating of 2 or 3. And then neighborhoods that are considered “less safe” or “less desirable” have schools rated 6,7,8 etc. (Getting the ratings mostly off of great schools or similar sites). 

Example: a school in Logan Square (a neighborhood that seems to be rated highly) will zone for a 1/10 school where as a neighborhood like Kenwood which we haven’t seen as many high ratings on will have like a 7/10 school. 

So my question is how much do school ratings really mean? Does your kid go to a “low rated” school and learn a lot and have great experiences? Does your kid go to a “highly rated” school and you don’t notice much of a difference vs. other schools? Are these metrics based on safety, test scores, what? 

I promise I am not trying to be offensive and I understand that a lot of what I’m saying is generalizations and no area is completely good or bad and just because an area is “unsafe” doesn’t mean the students don’t do well etc. 

But I’m just confused because when we’re finding a rental we like that is in an area we like and has good space, etc. the school zone usually is lacking. 

For context, we currently live in Florida which usually is considered to not have great schools. Previously my son went to a 4/10 school and it was terrible, lots of classroom issues and he didn’t learn much the entire year (maybe it was just his teacher?). We then moved him to an 8/10 school and he learned a ton, went on a bunch of field trips, etc. I don’t know if that’s a coincidence or if the ratings really make that much of a difference. I also don’t know if northern schools are just better overall so maybe a Chicago 3 is a Florida 10 type of thing.

I really mean no offense to anyone who lives in any part of the city or attends any type of school, just looking to be in a place we enjoy while making sure my son has a great school experience.

"Can we be grownups: Will I be ""safe"" in these neighborhoods?","Hi folks!

I've never been to your lovely city, but it's being recommended to me, at least as a lovely summer get-away from my west-coast desert home.

I need honest yet respectful answers. You can answer a simple Yes or No, if you'd like. Here's what I need to know:

The following neighborhoods have been recommended to me, based on my interests, lifestyle, and age (mid 50s, Gen-X).

**Lincoln Park:** Sophisticated / Mature

**Andersonville:** Neighborly / Arts

**Hyde Park:** Intellectual / Lakefront

**Ravenswood**

Here's my concern: I'm a black woman. I know there are traditional 'black' neighborhoods, but I'm looking at an overall lifestyle fit. I'm a creative artist, I'm introverted, and I like the arts/culture scene, great food, farmer's markets, community events -- this type of thing.

I ask because I keep hearing that Chicago is notoriously segregated, and I want to make sure that I will be safe if I move into these areas, or any.

For context: I'm originally from an east coast city, so I understand not being welcomed in certain neighborhoods. There were/are certain neighborhoods I just knew to stay away from. I didn't hang out in them, I didn't shop or eat there. I just avoided these areas and did my thing in more ... integrated areas, let's just say.

Walking to School Horror Story from this Morning,"Two months ago I moved to Chicago  from the west coast. Coming from the quiet suburbs of San Francisco, I've always been a little wary while walking outside in Chicago. I've heard stories of violence, perpetrated out in the open against innocent and unassuming pedestrians; the fact that crime has always been sequestered within the inner city back in SF has only heightened my anxiety of encountering criminals. Anyways, I live in East Pilsen, which has been deemed a relatively safe neighborhood by reddit's consensus. However, after my morning commute to school, I would beg to differ because I was assaulted. On the sidewalk, A woman and I were walking in convergent directions. She was short in stature, and so were the two dogs she was walking. Upon first glance, she seemed to cast off any suspicion of being a criminal, unfortunately her seemingly unassuming visage would betray her malicious disposition. As the distance between us drew closer, one of her dogs began to bark and then it bit me. It stung, and since the dog was on one of those leashes that slackens and extends when the leash is pulled, I couldn't evade the attack. So it's about one full second before I am able to pull my leg away by walking two steps in the direction of my normal commute. I don't dare say a word to the woman because I am late for school, and also she is hispanic and I know that there is gang activity in Pilsen and I worry that if I tell her off, a gang member may see me encroaching upon their territory. You could say that I'm kind of in a tricky situation right now. Here is a link to the picture of the dog bite. Luckily, I was wearing jeans and long underwear.

Public Transit - From what I’ve read, you could live in DC without a car and get around using their transit system. However, I’ve also read that it’s worse than the CTA. Would you say that’s the case?

Big City Feel - I love the fact that I live such a big city, every time I see the skyline I get a little smile on my face. How is the transition from a smaller city like DC? 

Social Scene/East Coast People - I’ve never had a problem striking up a conversation at a bar here in Chicago and the majority of people I’ve met here are cool. Is it easy to make friends in DC, is it like any other larger city?

Weather - I’ve been getting mixed signals on the weather in DC, some say it’s only better because of Chicago winters, but I actually don’t mind them too much. I’m pretty worried about the summers, I am not a fan of humidity, but is it comparable to Chicago summers?

Crime - Every neighborhood in the city has seen a rise in crime this year (muggings and carjackings), so we have definitely been more aware of our surroundings just walking around our hood. Is it more or less the same DC area?

These were the big ones I had questions on, but if you had any other input it would be great! Probably the other thing would be cost of living but salary wise we would be making way more and be able to live just as comfortably.

Potentially making the move, and wondering how the two cities compare. I moved to Chicago 4 years ago and absolutely fell in love with the city. I saw myself living here at least throughout my 30s (25 now), but as the old story goes, I met a girl.

She has a pretty amazing career opportunity with an old colleague in the DC metro area that would require us to move there in 2018 and we are trying to weigh the pros and cons of the two cities. I would be able to work remotely with my current company and would be able to find something similar in that area if need be (I’ve also thought about pivoting career wise by getting an MBA and Georgetown would be easier to get into over Northwestern or Booth).

What Chicago neighborhoods have good apartments under $2k for a teacher ?,"Hi everyone. I am a teacher planning a move to Chicago this summer and starting my apartment search. My estimated gross salary with my experience and education is around $80,000, and my goal is to keep rent under $2,000 if possible.

I am flexible on neighborhoods since I am not fully sure where I will be working yet. I am mainly looking for recommendations on neighborhoods that are safe, well maintained, and realistic for a teacher budget. Easy access to public transportation is a big plus.

Ideally I am looking for a one bedroom, but I am open to a two bedroom with a roommate if it makes sense. I could stretch up to about $2,200 for the first year only if needed, but I would strongly prefer to stay in the $1,500 to $1,900 range.

If you have neighborhood suggestions, apartment buildings to check out or avoid, or tips for searching in this price range, I would really appreciate the help. Thank you in advance. 😊

What area should I stay in if I’m going to a concert at Soldier Field?,"My friends and I (4 of us total) will be in Chicago for the first time in August for a concert. We’ll be flying into O’Hare and won’t have a car. I’m trying to get an idea of where we should stay and the best ways to get around.

Here are the two options I’m considering so far:

\-Option 1: Stay in a hotel near Soldier Field. We may have a little bit of a walk or have to Uber to the pedestrian bridge, but that shouldn’t be too big of a problem. My only concerns with this option are that we won’t have a shuttle to our hotel from the airport, so an Uber could get pricey, and the hotels in this area seem to cost about twice as much as hotels near the airport.

\-Option 2: Stay in a hotel near O’Hare (with a free airport shuttle) and then Uber or take public transit to get to Soldier Field. My concerns with this option are navigating public transit (I’m from a small town that doesn’t even have bus service) or Ubering from so far away. We are also going to the concert two nights in a row, so that would be a lot of back-and-forth.

There may also be some other options that I’m not even considering. So what would you all do? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Got hexed twice by the same homeless woman. Who else has this happened to??,"So, three years ago (October 19, 2012 according to Facebook) my boyfriend and I were walking in Lakeview when a homeless woman approached us to ask for money. We said no, and as we walked away she yelled after us ""I hope yo' baby dies!""... which was such a specific and bizarre thing to say under the circumstances (we don't have a baby; I wasn't pregnant or pregnant-looking at the time) that we never forgot it. For years I have joked about how this person put a hex on my firstborn, fairytale-style.

Fast forward to last Friday night: we're walking to dinner after work in River North, and a woman walks up to us across the street from the rock &amp; roll McDonald's.

""You've gotta help me out... those people wouldn't, and I'm just looking for a little help. I just need to go in there [gestures to McDonald's] and get three fish sandwiches--"" to which we were like ""THREE?""

Anyway she asked us for money, we said no, we continued walking, and then suddenly...

*""I hope you both die, I hope yo' baby dies.""*

Reverse Commute From City to Skokie 3x/week. Is This Tolerable Without a Car?,"Hi, I’m potentially moving to Chicago for my first post-grad job and would love some local insight.

I’m in the final stages for a hybrid job based in Skokie, near the Skokie Courthouse/Westfield Old Orchard area. The role would be in-office 3 days/week and ideally, I’d want to live in the city (initially looking at Lincoln Park, Lakeview East, Uptown, Edgewater, or Rogers Park).

My question: is a reverse commute from those neighborhoods to Skokie tolerable via public transportation? I’d likely be taking the L and a bus. I’d prefer not to bring a car because driving in the city feels stressful and parking is expensive, and I’d rather rely on transit if possible.

If that commute sounds miserable/unrealistic, are there any recommendations for neighborhoods/towns closer to Skokie that still feel good for someone in their early 20s or areas that are relatively safe, transit-accessible, and somewhat social?

I initially wanted to live in the city for the social aspect but I’m trying to be realistic about commute and quality of life. Appreciate any advice or firsthand experiences

Edit: Oh my god, I did not expect to receive this many comments LOL but I truly appreciate everyone’s opinions and pieces of advice!

How safe is Avondale?,"I have searched this sub and other forums for info, but most comments are a few years old so I figured it's safe if I ask again. Apologies if I missed a recent post about this topic!

My boyfriend and I are seriously considering moving to Avondale from Lincoln Park. We're drawn to the neighborhood because we'll be getting waaaay more bang for our buck, public transportation seems accessible, and many of our favorite restaurants are nearby.

The main ""question mark"" in my mind is the safety of the area. I am a 26 y/o woman who will be walking about .4 mi to the Belmont blue line stop to commute downtown.

Details on the location: South of Barry; East of Central Cark/Milwaukee ave intersection; North of Diversey.

When we toured the place, it seemed to be a quiet residential street, with families on either side. Detached garage parking for my boyfriend's car and a fenced in yard for our dog are big selling points to us. The unit is on the first floor so any tips on home security systems are also welcome.

I have searched this sub and other forums for info, but most comments are a few years old so I figured it's safe if I ask again. Apologies if I missed a recent post about this topic!

My boyfriend and I are seriously considering moving to Avondale from Lincoln Park. We're drawn to the neighborhood because we'll be getting waaaay more bang for our buck, public transportation seems accessible, and many of our favorite restaurants are nearby.

The main ""question mark"" in my mind is the safety of the area. I am a 26 y/o woman who will be walking about .4 mi to the Belmont blue line stop to commute downtown.

Details on the location: South of Barry; East of Central Cark/Milwaukee ave intersection; North of Diversey.

When we toured the place, it seemed to be a quiet residential street, with families on either side. Detached garage parking for my boyfriend's car and a fenced in yard for our dog are big selling points to us. The unit is on the first floor so any tips on home security systems are also welcome.

"Found severely matted stray dog — need emergency grooming help? (she gets vaccinated Tuesday, I can pay $100)?","Hey everyone,
Last night I found a stray dog in the South Shore neighborhood and brought her in last night until the shelter opened up. I took her to Chicago Animal Care and Control (CACC) on Western, and a woman from PAWS Chicago told me she can get her vaccinated and checked (including an x-ray for her leg) this upcoming Tuesday.

The thing is — this poor girl is in rough shape. She’s severely matted, covered in dried poop, and smells awful. I bathed her five times last night, managed to free up her legs so she can finally poop normally, but the matting is still horrible. She cries when I try to clip her and will bite if I go too far, so I’ve done all I safely can.

I can pay for grooming $100 — that’s not the issue. The issue is that every groomer I’ve called requires proof of rabies vaccination, and since she’s a stray, I obviously don’t have that yet. I just need someone who’s experienced and kind enough to help clean her up asap, even if that means working around her a bit or using a muzzle.

If you’re a groomer, vet tech, rescue volunteer, or know someone who can help, please DM me. I’ll handle payment and transportation. I just want to make her comfortable and safe until her vet appointment.

Thank you so much, Chicago ❤️

Chicago Review. First time visit. Unbiased opinion attempt,"I am from Washington State (not a WA native though. but lived here for ~~12 years now) in the north Seattle Area (about 15 miles north of the space needle to give a reference point)

I just landed back home yesterday after a weekend trip to Chicago.

I unfortunately did not have as much time as i wanted there. and couldnt do everything that was on my list. I also had to rush alot of things because I was running out of time.

lastly, i mostly were in the (i hope i dont get the areas wrong. referencing google maps) Mag Mile, South Loop, West loop area. so my review will primarily be based on those places. so in general, it might not be a representation of chicago.

I dont go down to Seattle often, so my comparison might be incorrect. and again, this is based on the areas i was staying at while in Chicago. so PLEASE point out anything for me that may make my observations different. (either for chicago, or seattle)

So first of all, the location and area.

Domestically, this is my first time going any past the West Coast. The vibe around here is so very chill but also very obviously different compared to Seattle. My only understanding of Chicago is whats portrayed in the movies and TV. But my time there, i only saw 1 homeless person. The area and streets were very clean. and all throughout the day and night, there were alot of activity but still fairly quiet!

The vibe was amazing. I saw so many people wearing really nice clothes. Both men and women. but especially women. Alot of them had very nice looking dresses. it was as if they were going to the Gala, or a formal/semi formal dinner. Even when i was walking around W ohio st &amp; N wells st. There were so many people dressed nicely.

I RARELY see that in Seattle (if ever actually).

Also while walking around, there were so many nice looking restaurants that were also bustling. the atmosphere and vibe also looked and appeared great! many outdoor seating. dim lighting, great mood, etc.

Food

this is one of my regrets. I didnt have enough time to try out as much as i can. I also cant eat as much as I used to be able to when i was younger. The places I visited were

* Au Cheval

* Small Cheval

* Al's Beef for Chicago Dog and Italian Beef (Dry with the gravy on the side)

* Street Stand Chicago Hot Dog

some other stuff that wasnt Chicago Related. But had no choice due to x y z factors (it was late, no time, etc)

but overall, I only ate at around 8 spots total. (including the ""non chicago related"" spots).

some other spots and/or foods I wanted to try were

* Pequods

* Lous

* Deepdish &amp; Tavern style pizza

* Haralds chicken Shack

* Jims original

* Kasama

* Portillo's (to compare)

I dont quite recall how much each food was. But it definitely felt cheaper than in Seattle. Except for any kind of street stand areas (I ate a chicago dog at the vendor after visiting the shedd aquarium. that one was small and like $6. Doesnt come with fries)

Everything I was able to eat was a 10/10.

Au Cheval is something I highly recommend. I got the single Ch burger with Egg and bacon (of course) it comes out to ~~$36 with 20% tip. 

The burger itself is $17. an Egg is $3 and bacon is $7.

This part might be controversial and contradictory. Its worth it, but its also not worth it. If i ever go back to chicago, will I be getting it again? yes 100%. Although a bit over salted, its also definitely 1 of the top burgers I ever had. the egg and bacon add on surcharge is expensive. but its good and you HAVE to get it with the burger. Their egg is made delicately. sunny side up. the Bacon is very special and was similar to a maple smoked hickory peppered Bacon that were also thick. even if you dont get the bacon and egg, get it with the combo ATLEAST once. The burger is worth trying at least once.
The restaurant was also really amazing! its much smaller than it looks. but very well run.

and lastly, the land..... coming from Seattle, the flat lands were a freaken welcome and a gift... out of EVERYTHING, thats probably what i enjoyed the most. i stayed in chicago for 3 days/4 nights. and I was outside for majority of my time there. My god is it easy to travel around.... not to mention, public transport there is tier 1 (atleast in comparison to WA...)

Hey /r/Chicago - visiting Chicago the weekend of 8/25 and curious about a Donut shop!,"Hey /r/Chicago! A group of us are visiting Chicago from Aug. 25th-29th. Certainly not my first time (it is for some of my group), and definitely not my last. We all want to explore areas of the city other than the Loop/River North (where I've always spent most of my time in the city on prior trips), night life, restaurants, breweries, etc. I've already looked at ""What to do in Chicago"" in the sidebar for some ideas and definitely appreciate all the comments there!

We heard about this donut shop in the south side that apparently has some of the best (and biggest) donuts in the city. It's called Dat Old Fashioned Donut, in Chatham. I've also heard not so many good things about the neighborhood. We won't have a car (taking Megabus into Chicago, staying at a hotel in the loop) and will be relying on cabs/public transit (CTA 3-day pass).

I've done some research and it looks like it is possible to get there via public transit, but it's a bit of a cruise! Also, while I'm trying not to be ""too"" concerned about safety (we'll be going there after a trip to Hyde Park and the Museum of Science and Industry, and there are 4 of us in the group) it is certainly a concern from what I've heard about the area.

Basically, is it worth it? What is the best route? Google Maps says to get there from the Museum of Science and Industry to take the #55 Bus Westbound to #4 Bus Southbound. Back to our hotel, take #4 Bus Northbound to the Green Line at 63rd/Cottage Grove to get us back to the Loop.

If it's not worth the hype, definitely let me know! Would there be any other donut shops that are worth visiting instead?

Thank you all! Looking forward to (once again) visiting your fair city!

Where do actual women hang out in Chicago (that isn’t just Bumble IRL)?,"Hey Chicago,

41M here. Gainfully employed, emotionally literate, owns a dog, walks for miles, reads actual books. Also Indian (the born-in-India kind, not the spiritual-tourist kind), though I do cook Indian food a lot.

I’ve accepted that dating apps might be the Costco of romance, i.e. convenient, crowded, and somehow always out of the one thing you came for. So! Where do people (especially women) actually go to meet other humans in the wild these days?

I’m open to anything: bookstores, panels, trivia nights, weird indie film clubs, even bars with decent lighting and tolerable volume. Yes, I’m sober, but no, I’m not a monk or allergic to fun.

I’m into deep convos, running, long lakeside walks, and wondering why there are 400 breweries in Logan Square but no bookstore where people make eye contact.

Looking for places where people might truly talk. No judgment if the answer is “nowhere, stay on Hinge,” but I figured I’d ask before giving up and marrying my dog.

Thanks in advance — and don’t worry, I won’t pitch you a startup. 😉

No drinks = no hospitality ,"So so sick of this happening and wondering if this happens to anyone else / if anyone has suggestions on how to make the situation better. Me and my girlfriend (25&amp;26) love going out to restaurants but we tend to get really awful service and it’s like they follow the same script every time. Waiter will come over happy and as friendly as can be and ask “can I start you off with any drinks?” often when going out for dinner we don’t also have drinks but as soon as I say we are going to stick with waters you can see the waiters face completely change. 

Example 1. Very nice pizza place. We were sat and the waiter came up and asked if we wanted drinks and I said we are going to stick to water (as it was 845 on a Wednesday night) and immediately said “k. I’ll be back later” and then disappeared for almost a half hour before we could order food and when taking our food order he pushed drinks 5 times…. Didn’t fill up our waters the entire meal and had to flag down a different waiter to get a box and check. 

Example 2. River north semi casual place. Went in for dinner with a couple friends after walking the city the entire day and we were all dead tired and just really wanted water. Waiter came up super nice asked about drinks and when we said no got super annoyed at us. Can back with a water pitcher and slammed it down on the table. Came back for orders and said “what do you want?” We ended up ordering apps entrée and dessert but he would just very clearly upsetly throw our plates down. 

I get that if we don’t get drinks the tip in theory will be less but what… if we get a round of drinks for $36 x .20 = $7.20tip. Like if we get awful service you are going to lose a lot more than 7 bucks in tips so if it mattered that much why not be nice! 

Guess this is more of a rant but it’s the one thing I don’t like about living here. 7/10 times we get HORRIBLE service all because don’t get drinks. The places that are still nice we visit really often. Also I’m partially assuming no drinks combined with the fact we look young is an issue. It’s just disheartening when you can see the look on the waiters face change :(

Edit: I am so glad to hear we are an outlier here. I think there are many factors related to us and exterior factors and we just (wrongly) assumed it was due to drinks bc we definitely had that happen once or twice before. Also where we end up choosing to go seems to have a lot to do with it.

Pro tip for folks using Uber in the loop from an Uber driver,"if you are getting an Uber pickup in the loop, PLEASE type in the address rather than using your location on your phone. GPS and phone location in the loop are wildly inaccurate due to the tall buildings. Typically 1 out of three pick ups I get in the loop is off by anywhere from 1 to 4 blocks because people used their location on their phone. This affects navigation as well: much of the loop completely negates GPS satellites and our position on the map either wanders through buildings or the screen will just spin continuously. As a result, if you are watching our location you can see us all over the place in a matter of moments. 

Just a tip to make the whole process easier. Last night I get a pickup at 111 Wacker, wait 5 minutes and the woman calls me saying shes at Adams and Franklin. She gets mad that in traffic it takes me 5 minutes of one way streets to get her and cancels when Im almost there.

Moving next month - west loop? Safety as a single female? Beach scene? How’s old town?,"Moving from Manhattan to Chicago next month, and will be out there next week to find a place. 

After tons of research I narrowed down my target neighborhoods to Lakeview East, Lincoln Park, and West Loop. Working downtown, I realized I don’t want to commute 30 (+) mins daily, especially starting a new job and familiarizing myself with the city. (But in general I don’t want to spend so much of my day in the car if I can help it.) So I eliminated Lakeview and Lincoln Park.

I love to go for evening walks which I know is much better by the lake but I saw there are parks in West Loop and going for walks on city streets is fine for me. I was a little concerned West Loop may a little less safe than say east of 90-94. But it seems pretty alright. Do you think it’s pretty much nearly as safe, need not worry? (Yes, yes, be aware of your surroundings, etc.)

How big is the beach scene there? I don’t picture myself going in the water and I’m guessing it’s 3-4 months of the year. I know it’s bit of a trek from west loop. 

Garage waitlists in West Loop can be 30ppl long and the neighboring garage is quite pricey. Assuming it’s still helpful a car though right? Especially in super cold weather to get groceries, etc? 

Lastly, someone just recommended I check out Old Town. The commute isn’t bad and I get the proximity to the lake. Let me know what you think. 

Fyi. Moving on my own (so don’t need to think about kids and schools). Also, love ppl of all ages but would prefer not to be limited to predominately 20 something year old party-ers and a new transplant finding her way. But don’t want a sleepy neighborhood either. 

I’d appreciate any thoughts (or if I missed a beat on something, e.g., traffic): 
• west loop target
• west loop walkability. Trails.
• other neighborhoods, old town? Ideally 20 mins or less to the office 
• safety, safety, safety

What are some inexpensive places to visit that a 9 year old girl will enjoy?,"I'm visiting Chicago from the UK next month, my daughter is 9 and really wanted to come to America, but specifically didn't want to go to New York. I've visited Chicago a couple of times and really enjoyed just being there, so I suggested a visit to Chicago, and she's really looking forward to it.

She saw a YouTube short about some sort of slime place, and is most insistent that we do that, and that's going to cost me 60 bucks for probably an hour's fun. She wants to eat a hot dog and some pizza, and she loved the Garrett's popcorn that I brough back so wants to go there too.

So you see, everything is costing me.

I'm arriving on a Sunday night, got Monday and Tuesday all day (with a visit to the slime place Tues morning), and we're leaving to go back to O'Hare on Wednesday at about 4pm. 

I reckon she'd enjoy spending a bit of time on Navy Pier, and I know that'll end up costing me too. Not sure about the zoo, I'd rather spend time doing something I can't do at home. 

I'm just wondering what else she might find interesting, and most importantly that will keep her out of American Girl! Doesn't have to be free, but I'd rather not spend a thousand bucks on this trip.

We're staying near Grand on the Red Line. Happy to use the L or walk about a bit to get to places.

Aside from finding pizza, a hot dog, and for me an Italian beef, are there any other spots where we could eat? If I can have a nice beer at the same time even better.

One night (tonight) and one day with 2 little girls…,"
My 3 and 5 year old and I are in Chicago for the next 24 hours…. Silly story but getting into Chicago at 5pm, staying at the Drake Hotel (my dad insisted/paid for it because we are picking up my brother tomorrow at 5pm from O’Hare).

So looking for easy with kids dinner and lunch recs… as well as things to do. My plan was Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum but idk if other spots might be more fun. My 5yo is obsessed with Ancient Egypt and Greece. They love art and animals and dinosaurs and princesses, etc but we live in Houston and have great museums (childrens museums and a Color Factory) as well. 

I personally like fun/funky/interactive art installations (they did Meow Wolf over Spring Break and crushed). Its gonna be hot but didnt bring swimsuits so dont want to do beach/splash pads.

Food-wise they love pizza (more thin crust gals than deep dish but open to spots bonus points if near the Drake and quick-ish), Mexican food, typical American kid crap (burgers, shakes, fries, tendies, etc), and they LOVE breakfast. Diners, pancakes/eggs, etc.

What you got?!

EDIT: thank yall so much for all the recs!!!

Hyde Park with Young Children ,"I'm sorry if this question has been asked before (I used the search tool and couldn't find what I was looking for).

My husband, three young children, and I are relocating to Chicago. We are strongly considering Hyde Park, due to convenience to my husband's new job at UC; however our realtor recommended Lakewood/Lincoln Park area instead. My husband said he doesn't mind the commute, as he is only expected to be on the campus 3 days per week; but I am wondering if Hyde Park could be a good fit for our family, given the convenience and excellent price point. 

We love city living, and convenience to 'stuff/amenities', lots of people, etc. However we also have young kids and want a safe, walkable neighborhood, where I can take my kids out to ride scooters/run around after dinner without safety issues. 

Also to note, we have been to Chicago to visit probably a dozen times, and absolutely loved it; however we only explored the Gold Coast/Lincoln Park area in the past, so I have no knowledge of any other areas.

Any information you could provide would be appreciated. Thanks so much.

Help Find This Hidden Chicago Airbnb Studio from 2019/Early 2020 – Want to Recreate Magic Moment?,"Hey Chicago Redditors (or Airbnb pros!),
This might be a total long shot and probably a lost cause, but I’m desperately trying to track down an Airbnb I stayed in with my boyfriend back in late 2019 or very early 2020. It was our first big trip together, and the place was so quirky and memorable that we’d do anything to find it again to celebrate over 6 years together. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to old receipts, emails, or my old Airbnb account anymore After scouring the site myself, I don’t think it’s listed these days. If anyone remembers hosting something like this, or stayed in a similar spot, or even knows how to dig deeper into Airbnb archives, please help a girl out!
Here’s everything I can remember about the place:
•  Location: About 15-20 minutes from downtown Chicago (by car or L train).It was in an unmarked building accessed through an alley—super hidden gem vibe. Outside was either brick or cement block. Right down the street was a CVS or Walgreens in a strip mall/plaza. High security and there was another place with ATMS located right inside 2 glass doors. 
•  Layout: It was a studio-style apartment, no separate bedrooms. Everything was open: a small couch right next to the bunk beds, a nice kitchen table for meals, and the bathroom was the first thing you saw when you walked in the front door (right at the entrance).
•  Sleeping Setup: King or queen-sized bunk beds built right against a full wall of windows overlooking the downtown skyline—waking up to those city lights was unreal! There was a small TV mounted on or near the bottom bunk for lazy viewing.
•  Bathroom Details: Fancy wall-mounted soap dispenser in the shower (like hotel-style, not the usual pump bottles).
We ate at Nico Osteria (1015 N Rush St in Gold Coast) one night, which was about 15-20 minutes away—
If this rings any bells, or you have tips on how to search old listings (without account access), I’d be eternally grateful. We’re planning a surprise trip back to Chicago to relive it all—fingers crossed this isn’t impossible! Thanks in advance for any leads or ideas. ❤️

Is Kimball Ave a recommended area to stay in?,"
Hi, I know Chicagoans hate when people ask if places are safe but I searched the internet for answers and got mixed results/no results. I’m a black female (18) and this will be my first ever solo trip. I’m from a city that is generally safe and small, safe enough to where I can walk around the town at night with my headphones on lol. 

That being said I reserved an apartment that has no reviews due to it being new to the site, but I decided to give it a chance because it looked nice and is relatively cheap. Took me awhile to get to my question sorry but I’m just wondering if Kimball ave (cross street is W Wabansia Ave..) is a safe area? I did a little street view peek and it did look a little rough but, I don’t wanna judge a book by its cover and I’m just wondering if any locals know anything about it. It’s also nearby Humboldt park (see mix reviews on that), and Logan Square?.. I don’t know man. Thank you if you respond !



(Also a little extra excerpt if you care, I don’t drive yet and this place is about a 2 hour walk away from millennium park and all the Chicago goodies (and I do like a good walk), and about 50 minutes on a ride taking 2 different buses. Thinking I should maybe get over my germaphobia and stay at a hostel nearby 🤷‍♀️)",AskChicago,0,1740005838.0,35,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1itjabi/is_kimball_ave_a_recommended_area_to_stay_in/,"Is Kimball Ave a recommended area to stay in?

Apartments for young working professionals?,"hi everyone! i'm a 23 year old girl, and may be moving to chicago relatively soon for work. unfortunately, i dont know anyone in the city as i'm moving from california- and was just wondering which areas would be best to meet new people (im single, idk if that matters), mingle with likeminded professionals, and overall build a good network of friends outside of work. 

i will not be bringing my car, and am specifically looking within the river north/west loop areas (but im open to anything!). my office is located in west loop- and the reason i want to be near there, is because i would like to walk to work (or take the train if i absolutely have to) if possible. i'm looking for a 1 bed 1 bath apartment (not studio preferably). my budget is around $2k - i'm not sure if this is completely unrealistic, but of course i'd be willing to go higher if absolutely necessary. 

not sure if this is relevant, but might give you an idea about me/what i enjoy doing with friends in my free time i like: 

\- taking walks with friends + coffee/matcha runs

\- trying new workout classes

\- grabbing a drink in a nice outdoor area

\- finding new brunch spots

\- rooftop bars! and i love a good night out

\- essentially, would love to try new things! i'm completely open and spontaneous :)

In town for a few days. What jazz clubs and lesser known attractions should I consider?,"Arriving tomorrow and leaving Saturday most likely. Two of us in our mid-30’s here to see Oasis and have a good time. Going to cut to the chase:

1) I know Green Mill is very popular and gets packed quickly. We are staying in the River North Area and we’ll be getting to town around 7 PM. We need to check in, unload, and then hit the road. Is 8-8:30 on a Wednesday night too late at having a shot for a seat for a couple? If it is, we’ll go elsewhere. 

2) I see Andy’s offers late night jam sessions. It’s closer and they take reservations. This might be easier to manage. How is Andys and the jam session in particular? Should I catch a late show at Jazz Showcase instead?

3) We may try to fit another jazz club or blues club in on Friday. Any recommendations? I heard Kingston Mines mentioned multiple times. We’re not big dancers, but we’re cool with vibing at a table and having drinks while others dance or just watch music. 

4) We’ve done all the big tourist things. Last big one for us to do is the Field Museum. How long should we budget for a visit?

Places to Visit in Chicago for the First Time on a Budget?,"Hi Everyone! I am visiting the Windy City for the first time this Friday night to see my long distance girlfriend for the first time. I’ll be staying at her place until early Tuesday morning, so my main expenses will be airfare, public transportation/rideshares, and food/activities. 

I’m a college student on a tight budget (around $300 for the trip, though I have a credit card for backup). I want to explore the city with her but don’t have a solid plan yet. Here’s what I’m considering:

1. Walk the Magnificent Mile and visit stores along the way (edit 2: You can tell i’m not a native… Did not realize that Michigan Ave was the Magnificent Mile..)
2. See Buckingham Fountain and the Wrigley Building
3. See the Art Institute of Chicago
4. See the Chicago Tribune building
5. Do the Hancock Tower tilt experience
6. See Sears Tower
7. Try classic Chicago food (Portillo’s Hot Dogs, Velvet Taco, (edit 3: I mentioned Velvet Taco because my gf said it was really good and went back to back, so wanted to see if it was good myself. Thought it was a Chicago staple, but looks like they’re everywhere, lol.) or some good Chicago Pizza since I’ve never had it before.)
8. Find an affordable but good spot for a nice date with my lady. (edit 1: took fine dining out because that isn’t a dealbreaker for me. As long as the vibe is nice, that’s fine with me).

Any advice or tips? Are there any must-try restaurants/must-see places that are unique but budget friendly? Also, would love any suggestions for cool, cheap, or free things to do! If there’s free events or free things to do around the city this weekend, that would be great!

8. Find an affordable but good spot for a nice date with my lady. (edit 1: took fine dining out because that isn’t a dealbreaker for me. As long as the vibe is nice, that’s fine with me).

Any advice or tips? Are there any must-try restaurants/must-see places that are unique but budget friendly? Also, would love any suggestions for cool, cheap, or free things to do! If there’s free events or free things to do around the city this weekend, that would be great!

We want a place where we can walk to places like parks, cafes, nice restaurants and that is relatively safe. ( I know crime could happen anywhere!)

What is a good bar/lounge to meet and chat with people midweek?,"I'm overnighting in Chicago on Wednesday and am hoping to find a new (to me) bar or lounge with a chatty, social vibe. My usual spot when I'm in town is Monk's, but I'm looking for a vibe that's a little more cocktail-y, slightly dressy, etc. I'm in my late 30s, so not interested in a scene that's dominated by the &lt;25 crowd. Staying on Mag Mile, so the ideal place is between Old Town and the South Loop. Bonus points for live music that's enough to fill the gaps in conversation but not so much you can't talk without being rude or shouting.

Finding a bar with a good vibe and temporarily connecting with a stranger is one of my favorite things to do when I'm on the road. I think it's good practice for being human :) Some memorable nights include:

* Meeting two ATCs in the skinniest bar in OKC and hearing all about their work
* Walking back to the hotel from Rosh Hashanah services in Seattle, happening upon a dive bar that was doing karaoke, and laying down a couple bangers with the pals I made
* Discovering (at Monk's!) a guy who had attended to the same college at the same time as me. We discovered that we knew some people in common but had never heard of each other.
* Hearing about all eight grandchildren from a woman whose train was delayed at Union Station
* Connecting with a geologist in Stovepipe Wells (Death Valley) as she was meandering across the country with her Aussie Shepherd

Where can I meet the next interesting person? Is the Zebra Lounge a good spot for me? Thanks in advance for the recs!

What the suburbs have to offer for families that the city does not?,"Family here, four kids ages 1 through 9. Moving to Chicago from FL. We’re debating whether to move to Naperville/Plainfield/Bolingbrook burbs that go to the 204 SD. Decided one day to look for homes closer to the city and found a great option that we really liked in the Jefferson Park neighborhood. House checks all the boxes, of course less backyard and land than what we would get in the burbs, but we literally have everything we would want within 4-10min drive or 10-20min walking distance, and the assigned schools, while not Naperville schools, are rated just fine, kids can walk to it and I know they would love to do that. Our only concern is: crime rate, and I know this is a controversial topic. In our research we have found that this neighborhood is relatively safe, but this based on online databases or maps, nothing from real world experience from people living in the area. We love the idea of having so many parks, libraries, museums, restaurants, Metra, expressways, just around the corner. And having lived in suburbs our entire adult life, we feel this is a great opportunity to move to such a large city as Chicago.

On the other hand, we want what’s best for the kids. Suburbs would offer peace of mind due to how safe they are, potentially more long lasting friendships as most people own rather than rent, and all schools are highly rated.

Relocating to Chicago soon — what should I know about living in South Loop / Printers Row?,"Hey everyone,

I’m **relocating to Chicago this spring** and am considering the **South Loop / Printers Row area**. I’ve toured a few buildings and really like the combination of walkability, transit access, and the proximity to the loop and the lake. However, I’d love to hear from people who actually live there.

**A bit about me:**

\- I’m a young professional **working remotely** in tech/security.

\- Male POC.

\- I prioritize a quiet-but-not-dead neighborhood with access to groceries, gyms, cafés, etc.

\- I’m coming from **out of state**, so I’m looking to get a realistic sense of what day-to-day life is like in this part of the city.

\- **Have a car** and am considering taking it, but have heard it might not be necessary

**What I’m hoping to learn:**

\- How safe do you feel in South Loop / Printers Row, especially at night or during early mornings?

\- What are the noise levels like (traffic, trains, nightlife, events at Soldier Field or Grant Park)?

\- Is it convenient to access groceries and essentials without a car?

\- How reliable is public transit (Red/Blue/Green lines, buses)?

\- What is the neighborhood vibe like on weekdays versus weekends and during different seasons?

\- What local community options are available, such as gyms, cafés, restaurants, shopping, etc.?

Possibly Moving to Chicago — Recommend Neighborhoods?,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, I’m looking at moving to Chicago (sometime this winter).  It would be me (20s male), my wife (20s), and our small dog.  I’m currently interviewing for a job out in the suburbs (Naperville) and am waiting on a decision for a job in the Loop.  These would both be hybrid positions (at least 3 days per week in office).  Household income grosses $90-100k.  

I’ve looked  at apartments and townhomes online and have been a bit overwhelmed to be honest.  We’d like to keep rent at or below $1800/month but we can go as high as $2000/month.  We’re not too concerned with the higher rent costs because we would get rid of one of our cars and pay off the other which would decrease our monthly transportation expenses by around $650 ($500/month after adjusting for CTA costs).  We’re coming from an area where you need a car to live essentially.  

What are some of your favorite north side neighborhoods that are affordable, walkable, and safe?  Family-friendly is also a plus (we’re planning on starting to try to have kids in the next 2-3 years).  Why are they your favorite neighborhoods?  Pros/cons?  Political/social leanings of neighborhoods?

Also, we’re traveling to Chicago next week to spend a week in the city and get a feel so we’ll be able to visit any areas you mention/recommend.

Solo work trip to Chicago (first time) with 2 days free to explore - what should I do/see?,"Hi everyone, 

I am travelling from Europe to Chicago for a work conference in a couple weeks and it will be my first time in the area. 

I am staying near O’Hara (Rosemont area) because it’s near the conference location but I do have 1.5-2 days of free time before hand to explore and would love to hear what you think I should do. For context, I am a woman and will be travelling solo. 

I am keen to do the river architecture trip as everyone seems to rave about it and I do love to photograph buildings. I also love visiting book shops and nice cafes with good coffee and matcha (if they have great baked goods even better). 

Because I have limited time to explore I guess my main questions are: 
- What is, in your opinion, the best/safest way to travel into the city from Rosemont? 
- I’d be quite keen to visit a specific shop which is in Wicker Park (N Damen) - what else should I do around that area?

- Anything best avoided?

"Where should I live in Chicago if I'm commuting to East Chicago, IN?","Hi! I’ll be moving from Dallas to Chicago this summer for an internship and would love some advice on the best living/commuting setup. I’ll be working in East Chicago, IN, five days a week.

I’m 21F and have visited Chicago before (early February) and absolutely loved it, so I'm excited to see what the summer has to offer. I’m really into art, theater, music, and generally want to be in an area where it’s easy to meet people and explore the city. I plan on spending a lot of time downtown and around different neighborhoods.

I’m totally fine using public transportation for getting around the city, but my job requires me to have my own car, so I won’t be able to use transit for my daily commute. Ideally, I’d like to live somewhere not too far north since I know the commute could get rough, but still relatively close to downtown. I’ve heard good things about River North and the Loop, but I’m open to other suggestions.

I regularly commute 30–45 minutes in Dallas, so traffic doesn’t scare me too much. That said, is there anything specific I should know about driving to East Chicago? Is there a big difference between taking toll roads vs avoiding them?

I’ll be receiving a housing stipend, so cost isn’t my biggest concern. Parking availability is more important, especially for days when I’m not using my car.

We’re both pretty big homebodies but do like to venture into the city from time to time.

Moving to Chicago this summer - where should I live?,"Hi all! I recently found out I will be moving to Chicago in June! I am excited, but nervous as I have never been there before. With my current schedule, I’m not sure when or if I will have time to visit and look for an apartment, so I am hoping to do a lot of the searching online.

About me:
- I’m 30, male, single, and gay
- I’ve lived in Florida my whole life (but I am FINALLY getting out!)
- I’ve never lived in a big city (only in the suburbs of one)
- I will be working in the southernmost part of Near South Side (near Chinatown)

I’m looking to find an apartment in an area that will be welcoming, fun, safe, and not overwhelming. It would be great to live near where there’s a thriving LGBT community, but idk if Boystown (Northalsted) is too far for my commute. I will have my car, but if I can use public transportation that would be great. Oh, and budget is around 2k

Initially I was looking in South Loop, but now I’m wondering if I should look north of the river for an area with more culture and where I can more easily meet people. If I do look further north and decide to drive, how is traffic typically for a north-to-south commute down Lakeshore? Doesn’t seem bad based on Google Maps but that could be deceiving.

How is living in the Loop vs River North?,"For some background, I (27M) am looking to move to Chicago from Des Moines next spring. I'm planning on talking to a leasing agent closer to my move-in date, but I'm doing some preliminary research. I work remotely, so commute isn't a factor for me. I've been to the city a couple of times, once in the Lakeview/Lincoln Park area and once around the Loop for Lollapalooza. I see Lakeview recommended often for newcomers to the city, and it's a strong contender for me (as is West Loop), but I'm really looking to compare highrise neighborhoods so I can narrow things down and decide more based on what sort of experience I want. I view Lakeview as a really good safe option, but all the highrises make my monkey brain happy, so I at least want to consider it. More practically, I think the Loop could also be a great home base because all the transit converges there. With that, I could explore other neighborhoods really easily while helping to minimize the number of transfers I have to do, which would help mitigate the recent issues I've heard about the CTA.

I'm sure this question has been asked, but the reason I'm asking now is just to see if things have changed post-COVID with so many people going to remote or hybrid work. Is the Loop still pretty much purely a business district? Would I be better off just sticking with River North if I'm looking for the highrise sort of experience? The main reason I'm moving is because I'm looking for walkability and a good social scene where I can meet people more naturally and frequently see the same people. To be totally transparent, I'd really like to have an easier time meeting single women too. I don't particularly care about bars, but cool cafes and a good hobby scene (e.g. cooking classes, running/walking/cycling clubs, coffee roasting and latte art classes, etc.) would be really nice. In some ways, the thought of it being quiet at night is actually sort of appealing since I could have a quiet place to retreat to at the end of the day, but if it's just socially barren, there's no point.

(And probably my three seconds aren't worth my attempts to assert my right of way, but people have to learn to drive correctly somehow, scaring the shit out of them is the only thing I can think of since the police clearly aren't doing a good job).

Is North Chicago Safe As A Home Base For A Birthday Celebration?,"(Modified: To clarify we will be staying in the Rogers Park neighborhood)  
Hi friends,We've been to Chicago many times and love it. Usually we drive through Schaumburg, eat at Penang (I am of Malaysian heritage) and continue onto Wisconsin where my daughter goes to school. We also love Downtown Chicago and have stayed in hotels off the Miracle Mile and went in on the whole tourist experience.

Because we and our daughter love the city so much, we decided to celebrate her 21st in Chicago this Spring. Since we're bringing 6 of her friends from semi-rural/suburbian Wisconsin we decided to get an airbnb in North Chicago. Off Clark St (The Harmony House?) not far from the Chicago Public Library. We plan to take the train from the Morse St station into the city.

We're not as familiar with that part of town and I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on whether that location is advisable for two adults and perhaps not as street smart 6 young adult women to use as a home base for our festivities. We won't know the exact address until the morning of the day of the stay. We still have a few weeks until we can cancel for a full refund.Our main concern is security and logistics and a fun experience for everyone concerned in a city where we've had nothing but the best time.Thoughts and recommendations?C",AskChicago,0,1711436696.0,33,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1bo1kdc/is_north_chicago_safe_as_a_home_base_for_a/,"Is North Chicago Safe As A Home Base For A Birthday Celebration?

"r/Chicago, are you having problems with AT&amp;T data service downtown?","**TL;DR**: AT&amp;T needs to fix their network in their home town. Help me convince them to.

Here is my story. On New Years Day, my wife and I went to Apple to upgrade our iPhone 3Gs to the 4S. We previously had no problems with our service (except for Chinatown, specifically on the Orange Line between Roosevelt and Halsted)

With my new iPhone in hand, I was hoping to continue checking out Reddit and such on my commute. I was mistaken. I work one block away from the AT&amp;T HQ. My phone shows 4 to 5 bars and 3G. Yet, all of my applications either say I am not connected to the internet or time out. Always. My phone does not start working properly until I am passed Halsted. So obviously there are issues downtown.

I talked with tech support both on the phone and in store. I got a gamut of possible problems, but no definitive answers.

""The towers in your area may be being upgraded.""

""There are a lot of buildings around.""

""There is a high amount of traffic in the area.""

""This is Apple's problem. (My favorite)""

All of these excuses are unacceptable. I am paying out the wazoo for a data plan I cannot use but for the few hours I am at home, when I would use my laptop for internet anyway?! What is that shit?

Has anyone else been dealing with these issues? I am considering sending a petition to corporate demanding these issues be fixed. I would like to have some people with similar problems backing me up.

If you are experiencing these issues, comment with the model phone you have, the neighborhood(s) you experience the problem in, how long you have had this issue, and any other info you think would be relevant.

**EDIT** If you have no issues with AT&amp;T data in the area and do NOT use an iPhone, please tell me what phone you DO have. If worse comes to worst, I want to make sure I get a new phone that will work.

**EDIT2** Looks like its a unanimous issue with iPhone 4/4S users in the Loop / West Loop / River North. As mandrsn1 said:
&gt; My personal opinion (as a former antenna/radio engineer) is that iPhones have a strong preference for a specific portion of the radio band. Thus, all iPhones are trying to use the same portion of the spectrum, making that bit very clogged. There is plenty of spectrum that the iPhone is avoiding, thus non-iPhones have unclogged frequencies on which to operate.

So it looks like we got three options:

1. Suck it up. AT&amp;T doesn't care enough to acknowledge the problem or indicate they are fixing it. (Requires AT&amp;T to do nothing, even profiting from those who pay for a service they cannot use. $$$ in AT&amp;T pockets)
2. Change to a different phone: Be it an earlier iPhone, or an Android / Blackberry. 
(Requires 2-year activation contract. $$$ in AT&amp;T pockets)
3. Change carriers. (Requires contract cancellation fee, plus two year agreement with another carrier and possibly a new phone if not unlocked. $$$ in AT&amp;T pockets)

Seems this is a very profitable issue to have.

**EDIT3** So I went to an AT&amp;T store and an Apple store. Returned my iPhone and got the new *inhale* Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket *exhale* I pull up some apps in my building and around town where my 4S was dead and IT WORKS!!

The problem with this is that ""sure you could ride your bike everywhere but your competing with cars and little bike lane support."" I will say that compared to years in the past when divvy wasn't so huge and wasn't on every corner, right now the bike network is fine. 

My proposed idea is to have a certain neighborhood (whatever that may be) be fully dedicated to bicycles to lessen congestion, improve local health and lower cost of living. Cars in areas like these shouldn't have to take up a sizeable amount of income per household to make a living or even to sustain a family.

What would you say to doubting parents about moving to Chicago?,"

We (late 20’s F) are moving to Chicago proper in the Jan-March months next year from Iowa- woohoo! 

I was raised in the suburbs, and my parents moved me out to Iowa due to the amazing school quality 20 years ago. 

Now? Iowa is not safe for LGBTQ individuals, and we are afforded so many more rights in Chicago- not to mention just the draw to live in a world class city! 

We will be moving to the northern neighborhoods, probably Rogers Park, North Park, Andersonville, or somewhere nearby. 

My mom grew up in Maywood in the 60’s-70’s, and moved out of the area in the 00’s. Times have changed, but she isnt thrilled at the idea. Says she only hears horror stories (aka media sensationalization). 

Obviously we know the areas we are moving to are safer than our current neighborhood in Iowa, but thats hard for my rural parents to wrap their head around (Note that my neighbors have been visited by SWAT, and my other neighbors have all been in violent domestic altercations. It is very common for cops to be on my block for multiple reason). We are not looking for their approval, nor do we need it, but if theres any way to calm their preconceived notions, it would help! 

What would you say to a couple of Boomers who have not been in the Chicago area for 20+ years that no, we will not be shot up in Chicago and we are going to very quaint neighborhoods in search for a better quality of life (we will be renting, so no arguments over property taxes LOL).

I’m not very familiar with the neighborhood… originally I was looking for opportunities in Lakeview/Lincoln Park… 



I field tripped there a few times (Noble Square, between Chicago and Grand/north to Fulton Market in particular). I do like the neighborhood, it seems diverse, quiet and safe - I always saw people walking their dogs or running, but just the businesses there don’t look to me blooming.



I researched a bit and some restaurants are just moving to the suburbs, some are only ""temporarily closed"" according to Google Map, not necessarily completely out of business, and most information online still suggests West Town is worth moving into/investing - any insights?

Moving to Chicago with a baby – condo + parking + transit advice?,"Hi everyone, my husband and I (30s) are considering a move to Chicago in the next year (late 2026 / early 2027) and would love some practical advice from people who actually live here.



We’re a family with a baby and are hoping to buy a 2BR condo around \~$350K. We know that budget comes with real tradeoffs, and we’re very open to evaluating them realistically (or rethinking our budget if what we’re looking for isn’t realistic).



What we’re flexible on:



* Older buildings
* Walk-ups (2nd or 3rd floor is fine)
* No fancy amenities (no pool, gym, doorman, etc.)
* Smaller buildings with fewer units. Our goal is to keep HOA fees reasonable, not pay for amenities we won’t use.





What we really need:



* In-unit washer and dryer
* Ideally \~ 1,200 sq ft; we don’t need a ton of space but I’ve seen some 2BR condos that are 800 sq ft and I think that might be too small
* Walkable neighborhood (grocery, pharmacy, park)
* Quieter, more residential feel (not nightlife-heavy) and safe
* Reasonable commute (45 mins or less) to the Loop (CTA, Metra, or bus)
* Parking for one car —  While great if parking were included, I understand that is very unlikely, so for this, we’re open to a garage/lot within 1–2 blocks that we can rent a space from (we’re trying to understand what’s realistic here)





Neighborhoods we’ve been researching so far:

North side:

* Lakeview, Lincoln Square, Edgewater
* Rogers Park, Albany Park

South side: 

* Bronzeville
* North Kenwood
* Hyde Park





A few specific questions:



1. Are there neighborhoods where condos in this price range more commonly include parking, or where nearby garage rentals are realistic? For families with one car, how do most people actually handle parking day-to-day?
2. Are there neighborhoods we should be considering that fit our overall profile but are often overlooked?





We’re not looking for perfection, just trying to understand what’s realistic before making a big move. Appreciate any insight, especially from parents or condo homeowners.

Aside from a brief story about their house partially burning down while he was a boy, I don’t know much else about his hardships growing up, or what type of reoccurring dangers Humboldt Park brought to him.  He chooses not to talk about this with his kids. If I ask my Mom about what my Dad has told her, she always tells me to “ask your Dad.”  
My Dad left Humboldt Park in 1974/75.  

Here are some general historical tidbits I know about:
The 1966 Division st Riots. 
The Latin Kings were founded in Humboldt Park. 
Humboldt Park was once a predominately Polish neighborhood until it began transitioning to a Puerto Rican neighborhood during the years my Dad grew-up there. 

People close to my Dad have told me how Humboldt Park is/ was one of Chicago’s hardest neighborhoods, but not much else. I’ve recently become fascinated with learning more about it. 

I’m hoping people who grew-up in or lived in Humboldt Park during the 1960s and 1970s will share their specific stories and/ or descriptions of this neighborhood back then.

Same with people who know someone who called Humboldt Park home during this era and is willing to share those stories.  

I’m not looking for any specific point of view.  I’m hoping to get feedback from multiple races, nationalities, and genders to help gain a broader, multidimensional understanding of this Chicago neighborhood back then.  As far as I’m concerned, there are no wrong answers and no unwelcome viewpoints — I’m hoping for raw authenticity. 

I hope many will share their unfiltered memories/ anecdotes — no matter how lovely or ugly or vulgar they may be  — which will help me better grasp where my Dad grew-up.

How to feel safe in elevated first floor unit?,"My husband and I are looking to buy a condo in Uptown or Rogers Park, and we've seen some elevated first floor units that we're really interested in (we rent in Uptown now). I have always lived in second or third floor apartments, and I'm wrestling with the pros and cons of moving to the first floor - primarily related to safety.

I like to keep the windows open as much as possible, including at night in the summer (best way to cool things down while keeping AC usage to a minimum). That said, we both like the possible energy savings of being on a lower level, as our current top-floor apartment gets hot as hell in the summer (even with all those open windows). Cutting down on the number of stairs would also be nice, as would not having to worry as much about our own noise levels because there wouldn't be neighbors below us in some of the buildings we've looked at.

Obviously, being closer to the ground with an open window heightens the chance of a break-in, and I also know that break-ins can happen to any building/floor. All that said - how big of a concern do you all think open elevated first-floor windows actually are? Are there break-in deterrents that would allow us to keep windows open a couple of inches in the bedroom at night to let in a cool breeze? I don't think I'm overly paranoid about safety stuff, but I do want to feel reasonably secure in my home, especially if I own it.

North Chicago-- which neighborhood should I live in?,"Hi there!

We need a good mix of walkability and city, but I also want to get in the car and go to the grocery store or Trader Joe's (I cook a lot). Also these dogs are killing me in an apartment and I feel like we need at least a pet relief area. One is old and won't be with us much longer, but I want her life to be awesome.

We're coming out for our first scouting trip in a few weeks and I want to prioritize some neighborhoods to look at.

The details:
Renting for the first year or so, budget &lt;$2500 for 3 bedrooms or 2 plus a space for an office. (We both work from home so need individual spaces.)
No commute to consider other than to ORD, but can use Lyft to do that.
I would prefer a townhouse/house with a small pet relief area.
Washer/Dryer in unit, dishwasher too. Does Chicago have disposals? I want one of those too...

Looking for walkability to stores, restaurants, parks, transit
Prefer to be in the city

Racial/socioeconomic diversity
Feel safe walking in the very early morning if no outdoor space (elderly dog currently needs to go out at 4AM)
We don't do the bar scene because we old. 
Tend to be civic-minded, cook a lot, like to eat out a good bit, not huge sports fans, but will probably go to a Sox or Bulls game on occasion. 
I love a good park, and have a deep, deep love for sitting by/in a pool reading in the summer.

"Long weekend in Chicago — hotels ($200–$400), steak, burrata, 420-friendly food ideas, rooftop lounge &amp; LGBTQ+ nightlife recs?","Hi Chicago!

My friend (driving in) and I (flying in) are planning a long weekend in early November. We’ll have a car, but want to spend most of our time in the city. Looking for recommendations on hotels, food, activities, and nightlife.

Hotels
• Budget: **$200–$400/night**
• Prefer near the **Riverwalk, Michigan Avenue, or Navy Pier**
• Considering the **O’Hare area + Blue Line in**, but not sure if that’s worth it for a short trip
• **Must be LGBTQ+ friendly**

Restaurants
• **Steak** (surf &amp; turf a plus)
• **420-friendly food experiences** (if anyone has recommendations that are compliant/legal in Chicago)
• **Italian** (burrata is a necessity)

Activities
• Want to do a **lounge/view in a tall building** (like Hancock or Willis)
• **Semi-touristy is fine**, but local finds are even better
• Considering things like:
	•	Architecture boat tour / Riverwalk stroll
	•	Museums or smaller galleries
	•	Hands-on classes (jewelry, metalworking, cooking)
	•	Bowling alleys or similar casual fun

After-Dinner / Nightlife
• **LGBTQ+ friendly clubs/bars** (any neighborhood recs welcome)
• Open to chill bars, lounges, or more lively clubs
• Also open to non-bar activities (bowling, late-night classes, etc.)

Specific asks:
• Hotel recs in our budget that are walkable/safe
• **Best steak + surf &amp; turf spots** locals prefer
• Italian restaurants with amazing **burrata**
• Rooftop or lounge with great views (bonus if it’s not too touristy)
• LGBTQ+ nightlife that feels welcoming

• Budget: **$200–$400/night**
• Prefer near the **Riverwalk, Michigan Avenue, or Navy Pier**
• Considering the **O’Hare area + Blue Line in**, but not sure if that’s worth it for a short trip
• **Must be LGBTQ+ friendly**

Restaurants
• **Steak** (surf &amp; turf a plus)
• **420-friendly food experiences** (if anyone has recommendations that are compliant/legal in Chicago)
• **Italian** (burrata is a necessity)

Activities
• Want to do a **lounge/view in a tall building** (like Hancock or Willis)
• **Semi-touristy is fine**, but local finds are even better
• Considering things like:
	•	Architecture boat tour / Riverwalk stroll
	•	Museums or smaller galleries
	•	Hands-on classes (jewelry, metalworking, cooking)
	•	Bowling alleys or similar casual fun

After-Dinner / Nightlife
• **LGBTQ+ friendly clubs/bars** (any neighborhood recs welcome)
• Open to chill bars, lounges, or more lively clubs
• Also open to non-bar activities (bowling, late-night classes, etc.)

Specific asks:
• Hotel recs in our budget that are walkable/safe
• **Best steak + surf &amp; turf spots** locals prefer
• Italian restaurants with amazing **burrata**
• Rooftop or lounge with great views (bonus if it’s not too touristy)
• LGBTQ+ nightlife that feels welcoming

Thanks in advance — we appreciate all the local tips! 🌈🍽️✈️",['Navy Pier'],[],0,Neutral/Concern,0.571
Thinking of moving to Chicago- how is the state of politics and safety?,"Thinking of moving to Chicago, however a lot of people I know who recently moved from there (to Miami, where I am) have been advising me to not go. A lot of anecdotal evidence of car jackings, attacks on the street etc. all in what I thought were safe neighborhoods (EX: river north, wrigleyville). The same people have been saying how there's a lot of issues with the political leaders there, people generally unhappy with the state of how things are etc. What are your thoughts on this? I can't tell if it's all anecdotal, especially since the kind of person who moves to Miami is a specific type of person, if anything the opposite vibe of someone who would enjoy Chicago.",AskChicago,0,1728567223.0,45,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1g0ixhq/thinking_of_moving_to_chicago_how_is_the_state_of/,"Thinking of moving to Chicago- how is the state of politics and safety?

Which area of the city should I move to (outdoorsy 36yo female)?,"Hi there! I'm moving from Boulder, Colorado to Chicago in May for work. I'm honestly really sad about it. I need the job, but I love it here in Boulder. It's pricey and not the most culturally diverse, but it's highly walkable/bike-able, super safe, there's endless hiking trails, lots of sunshine, and I can afford to rent a small house (with one roommate) so I have a little gardening space, which is important to me.

I guess I just don't feel like much of a ""city girl,"" (originally from small town Ohio) so I'm having a hard time figuring out which areas of the city I'd fit in the best. I'd love some input for where to begin my search for housing. Here's what matters most to me:

* Safety – I'm a single 36yo female with a cat
* Nature &amp; trees – I love hiking, running, backpacking, biking around town, playing in creeks and rivers, kayaking, etc. I feel anxious just thinking about being surrounded by high-rise buildings.
* Cost – I'll be making about $93k annually; would like rent to be $1,500-ish/month (or less)
* Culture/vibe – Again, I don't feel like a ""city girl."" Looking for neighborhoods with small-town community vibes where there's stuff to do but I can have peace and quiet at home.
* Commute – I'll need to get to my job in the Bucktown area 4 days/week
* House (vs apartment) – Probably not reasonable given my price range, but I love the idea of renting a very small house with a small backyard space for container gardening. And so I don't have to worry as much about apartment-living stuff like bedbugs, roaches, noise, etc.

Other stuff that might be helpful to know:

* I've kind of given up on dating but I am hoping to make new friends (people in their late 20s–mid-40s?)
* I have an SUV so will need parking (I more than welcome any tips for weekend excursions around nature, backpacking, camping, etc.!)
* I play the fiddle and really like bluegrass &amp; country - live music, going to picks, jams, open stages, etc.

Thanks so much for any thoughts, tips, guidance, or input!",AskChicago,0,1741467170.0,32,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1j6qol9/which_area_of_the_city_should_i_move_to_outdoorsy/,"Which area of the city should I move to (outdoorsy 36yo female)?

Potentially moving to Norwood Park? How is it overall?,"I work in Des Plaines and am trying to move closer to the city and work (currently in far west suburbs). Norwood Park seems like a good middle ground between the two. 

I’m 24, out of college for a year… is there much to do around the neighborhood?
