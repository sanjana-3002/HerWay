Why do people say the city is more dangerous than it is?,"Before I start, I'm not trying to be confrontational or dismissive. I'm genuinely confused at how people seem to overstate crime in many parts of the city. I feel like I'm missing perspective. Maybe a bit lucky. If any of this contradicts your experiences, I'm all ears.

I am not from Chicago originally, but I have lived here for over a year now. Multiple neighborhoods up and down the city. More specifically: Pilsen, Roseland, Rogers Park, Albany Park, Logan Square\*, and Belmont-Cragin, in that order. I also have worked around Norwood Park, Clearing, and Ukrainian Village. Suffice to say, I have a good feeling for what at least 90% of the city is like. Not one time did I walk the street fearing for my life. I never witnessed anything scarier than a drug deal or a loud argument (between people who already knew each other). The only time I heard gunshots was during the 4th of July when people were using them instead of fireworks. In fact, a lot of the time I walked at night, it was just me. By the way people online and offline talk, you'll think there's always a monster around the corner.

I'm not saying there isn't poverty in the city or crime is completely absent. I spent most of the last year effectively homeless and was victimized by a few white-collar scams\*\*. I also am aware of many parts of the city being working class or outright poor. The thing is, ""Chicago is scary"" isn't something exclusive to online suburbanites. The only difference is Chicagoans will get more granular and specify different neighborhoods.  Okay, fine so far, but who in the right mind is fearing Uptown? Where are the shootings going on in McKinley Park? Did anybody get mugged in Hermosa? I'm being completely serious here. Even the Loop seems to be portrayed as scary after dark. That last one in particular I can say is bullshit and a relic of how cities were in the 70s-80s.  
  
I personally have had to deal with violent, scary people, but only *once* it was somebody I didn't already know. It's of course my own personal experience, as I said I'm not here to dismiss anyone. It's just that I feel like the city has more to offer than right downtown, Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Wicker Park, and the ""civic worker suburb"" neighborhoods. The places where the claims of danger seem to be consistently backed up are some of the inner South Side (Fulton Park, Washington Park, Grand Crossing, Englewood) and West Garfield Park, plus a few small areas near them.

Am I the only one who feels like this? I hope I'm not just missing something.

\* Both the hipster and non-hipster parts.

Where do you park when the street spots are all taken where you live?,"Hey there. My bad if this question has been asked a bunch of times. I am considering moving to Chicago but quickly realizing that owning a car can be costly and having a place to put it is tricky.

(Before you suggest - no I don't wish to sell my car. I just bought a new one and I enjoy it. lol)

I visited earlier this month and was walking around some of the neighborhoods a little up north. I noticed that on the residential streets, a lot of the cars were bumper to bumper (which made me wonder what people do when they're gridlocked in and can't get out), and there were no empty spots available.

Car owners -  when the street/surrounding streets where you live have no spots left, where do you go? Do you just go block by block until you find one? I keep thinking of the scenario of coming home late when the spots on my street are all taken and having to walk multiple blocks to my apartment alone at night - I'm a woman and this generally just makes me anxious. Is this just a reality of having a car in chicago? Or are some areas less crowded as far as street parking availability goes? I understand that paid parking in a garage/alley is sometimes available, but in areas where there are a lot of mid rise apartments/walk-ups, that doesn't seem to be plentiful. Just trying to understand all of my options.

**Edit: WOW. I did not expect so many responses. I was so sure I'd get alot of sarcastic answers or people telling me not to bother coming. Thank you to everyone who provided insight, these responses are very helpful -**  even some of the snarky ones **lol. I still haven't read them all but after work I will revisit the thread and use this to fine tune what I'm looking for. It sounds like getting a paid spot is ideal, and cars are still not recommended, especially new ones. Not sure why I got downvoted when someone asked what area I was looking to live in, I was just... answering the question... but nevertheless, I appreciate yall. I think Chicago is a great city and I hope everything works out for me to relocate there!**",AskChicago,56,1730400725.0,273,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1gglzkj/where_do_you_park_when_the_street_spots_are_all/
Please help me become street-smart as a foreigner. What should I do?,"
Hello Chicagoans!

I am an international high school student from Korea who enjoys solo-travel and jazz. I am 16 and turning 17 next month. I came to Chicago alone and now pursuing my dream here. I really do love Chicago.


However, yesterday, I was outside north side of downtown around 6 pm, and was waiting for bus(22, clark &amp; elm). There was a homeless man sitting on the bench I didn't really pay attention to him.

However, out of nowhere, a man with a small knife approached to the bus stop where me and him were and pointed the knife at the homeless man's neck. My gut told me to leave, so i quickly started walking away from the bus stop. I could hear the homeless man starting to cough, and i felt something very dangerous might have happened. As soon as i realized I got pretty far away from the bus stop, i called 911 and explained everything that I saw and exact location to the operator and the call ended with her saying she sent the cops. Even after the call ended, I still felt frightened that I completely lost my sense of direction; I was wandering around the same area for 20 minutes, looking for a bus stop so I can go home.

After several hours later I started to feel okay but still now I am a bit scared of what happened that day. It was my very first time dialing 911. I am still wondering if I handled the situation correctly…

Before this happened, i used to go out alone and enjoy free jazz performances even until like 9:00 pm. But after this happened i just feel like staying at home. Im scared to go outside. 


1. Does this type of incident happen often  in Chicago?

2. What time would you guys recommend me to be home for safety, if i were your daughter?

3. Which part of Chicago should I avoid at most? Specific details would be really helpful. 

Thank you so much guys for your time.

Edit:  i never expected my post to get this much attention. First off, I want to genuinely thank all of you for your thoughtful comments. This was my first time sharing a personal experience on Reddit, and you’ve all been incredibly sweet and caring.

if any of my friends ever visit Chicago, I’ll just have them to this thread. it feels like a full guide. 

Thank you again to each and every one of you. Wishing you all a wonderful rest of 2024 !!",AskChicago,206,1735441920.0,109,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1homqcn/please_help_me_become_streetsmart_as_a_foreigner/
How bad is the red line really?,"I live in andersonville and just recently got a job in river north, and I will have to take the red line alone to get to work every day. I have been hearing absolute horror stories and how you will pretty much have someone threaten you or have something bad happen if you take the red line frequently. I asked one of my friends who is from chicago and she said as long as you don’t go on it at night I will be fine, and it’s a 9-5 job so I don’t think that will be a problem but I worry about the time change when it will be dark when I get off work. I bring my taser with me everywhere and plan on getting mace as well, but is it really that bad? I went and visited the office today and took the red line around 1 and did NOT know to not sit in the last car and did both going there and coming back, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I moved here from Alabama so I have no experience with this. If someone does try to come up to me and bother me what would be your best advice on how to handle that situation? Ignore them? Tell them to fuck off? What about if someone tries to follow me? ",AskChicago,0,1757199912.0,96,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1nadjta/how_bad_is_the_red_line_really/

"What time does the L become ""unsafe""? If at all?","Hey everyone - 

  
Traveling to Chicago in June for my bachelor weekend, and was planning on utilizing the L quite a bit. 

We are staying in the Pilsen neighborhood, so the Pink line is going to be our main transport. I have used the L (specifically Pink line) a lot when I travel in for Riot Fest, but have never used it during just a normal weekend. 

So the question is, is there a certain time of night we should consider getting an uber? Or is the L generally safe throughout the night?

Half of us live in St. Louis, so we know that a big part if just being aware of your surroundings. But, being stuck on a train is a lot different than just walking on the street.",AskChicago,0,1768252895.0,40,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1qb7np1/what_time_does_the_l_become_unsafe_if_at_all/
What's really going on in the South Loop?,"TLDR; Opinions on Sentral, The Cooper or 1000 South Clark? Also, more importantly, what's really going on at Roosevelt Station/nearby area? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. In case it isn't clear, I don't think anything of Chicago besides it's lovely and like any other major city. I just wanted to get a better understanding of what I've read on Reddit and was trying to offset the ridiculous nature of this post with humor!

UPDATE 2.0: **Final update, I promise.** I just wanted to say thanks again–y’all are really kind and reading your experiences has been very helpful. *Thanks for being my grain*s *of salt!* **If any of y’all in the South Loop (or nearby) want some new friends, DM me if you're interested in meeting up. My partner and I don't know anyone in Chicago and are starting from scratch.** Thanks again everyone!

**Background**: My partner and I are moving to Chicago (for work). With that being said, we're pretty stoked about it because we both fell in love with it when we visited a few years ago. We have lived primarily in the NE, specifically NYC (both Manhattan and the Bronx).

**Why the South Loop:** We've looked at a few areas, and we both seem pretty happy with Printer's Row/South Loop. We've read several threads, and we understand it can be a *sleepy* area, and that's fine with us. We have no issue traveling to other areas if we want to go out. We're pretty set with a few solid coffee shops and small businesses. Another reason we're set on it is the proximity to the park and the lake. Being close to green spaces is important to us, and we wanted to be within a quick walking distance.

Cool. Hopefully that answers anyone who might be asking *why* we're looking at this area. **We've found a couple of buildings that have interested us (Sentral, The Cooper, 1000 South Clark), so if you have any personal experiences, please share.**

Otherwise, my main question is this: **I've read that a lot of people love the South Loop, but it seems like even when people have nothing but good things to say... they all still mention Roosevelt station.** Now, we've ridden the NYC subway day and night, we've lived in some sketchy neighborhoods when we were broke college kids, and all of that was... fine. *Sus*, but, ultimately, fine. So, is everyone being dramatic? Have y'all never lived in another major city? Should we be looking elsewhere? Is it just the station–i.e. is it self-contained?–or is it the entire area? I don't even think we'll be taking the train often since we like walking when possible, but clue me in *please (am I going to get murdered? jk)*

I don't want to live somewhere where I'm constantly being harassed or where I'm scared to have my girlfriends/family visit. They're all already up in the air about Chicago being dangerous, and I hate being told ""I told you so."" My partner and I agree that any major city can be dangerous (uh, cue NYC), but are we walking ourselves into some kind of miserable (ahem, dangerous) trap? I seriously cannot get a clear read from everything I've read.

PS. Yes, we're going to visit in person, but visiting is very different than living. So, if you have lived experience, that's what we're hoping to read/understand.

Questions about my safety in Chicago?,"Me and my girlfriend were at a rave in Chicago on are way back to our car which was at least 10 mins away. There was a man who had stopped and was cat calling my girlfriend and she kept saying no and we kept telling him to leave us alone. We tried walking away from him and he kept following us with his car so we’re scared atp we keep telling him to leave us alone and he keeps on following us so I call the cops and we ended up coming across a group of people and that’s when he decided to finally stop following and drove off. We were in Pilsen, do things like this happen in Chicago often? You think his intentions were to kidnap my girlfriend? I told one of my family members and they said that people prey and lurk outside of parties for young kids to snatch. is Chicago really that bad to where even if your minding your own business you can still come across something scary like that ? Cuz I live in nwi which is 30-40 mins from Chicago. I always ways thought as long as you don’t associate yourself with criminal or gang activity you’d be fine am I wrong ? 

The thing I’m worried abt is what were his intentions if we hadn’t came across that group of people what would’ve happen?? That’s what’s scares the shit out of me like I got lucky that night. 

And do people really lurk outside of parties trying to prey on young adults or is that not exclusive to Chicago as well, but kind of part of every major city?",AskChicago,0,1758558192.0,46,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1nnr2kp/questions_about_my_safety_in_chicago/
Do you walk home from the bus stop/train station alone at night?,"Hello!

I’m moving to Chicago from SoCal in a few months, and I’m so excited! I love the city and can’t wait to live there full time. 

I’m not planning on bringing my car, but one of my biggest hang-ups around this is dealing with transportation at night (I’m not talking super deep into the night, just when it’s dark out). It’s not that I think that once the sun goes down, mayhem erupts, but as a newcomer to the city and a woman, I want to make sure I’m safe. 

If you’re taking public transpo at night, do you generally walk home from the station? Do you feel safe?

I’m hoping to live somewhere on the north side, and my goal is to live near transit. But in thinking about home in LA, I’d never walk alone from our red line unless my destination was literally across the street. Is this something I should prepare for??

Best lakefront neighborhood in Chicago?,"Which lakefront Chicago neighborhood would be a good fit for a single 45 year old woman moving to Chicago that doesn’t know a soul there?

*Safe to walk around by myself
*Rent budget is up to $2,000 but could be stretched to $2,500 for the perfect location. 
*A variety of good local restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, jazz clubs and/or within walking proximity to these spots
*Close to a Whole Foods and/or more grocery

Can you please critique my itinerary/give suggestions for next time?,"My sister and I came to Chicago last Thursday and overall it was a good experience. 

First Day:
-took CTA orange line to hotel 
-Went to Nutella cafe — good since we like Nutella 
-Strolled millenium park 
-Went to the Maggie Daley park — I love the Pedestrian Bridge don’t know why lol 
-Got lunch from Chicago dawgs — loved it but it was too acidic for my sis. Didn’t realize they didn’t the poppy seed bun there 😭
-Visited the Fine arts building— just to ride the manual elevator 😅
-Visited the Chicago cultural center— I love that place!!
-Went to Palmer House hotel— great architecture
-Architecture Boat Tour with Wendella— amazing experience. We booked 7:30 so we were able to get the sunset plus city lights at night time 
-Grabbed dinner from Wilma’s famous BBQ— we were tired and hungry after the tour and randomly chose this but it wasn’t good… 
-Ubered and walked to get around

Second Day: 
-Took the water taxi to Chinatown 
-Strolled Ping Tom Memorial Park 
-went to the Chinese American museum 
-got lunch from the Richland center — can’t remember where; was ok I think I picked wrong 
-Walked all over Chinatown square 
-Walked the area where the Pui Tak Center is, got food etc.
-We picked up dinner from Go 4 Food and it was sooo good! Their duck was delicious 
-We took the bus to go back to our hotel 
-We went to the Starbucks Reserve at nighttime 

Third Day:
-Got breakfast from Medici on 57th 
-Walked all over the university of Chicago campus, saw the Rockfeller memorial etc
-Went to ISAC
-Went to Midway Plaisance Park and we got to talk to some locals who were having a huge “HS reunion” type stuff 
-Went to 57th street beach 
-Had a late lunch at 14 Parish — the jibarito was good!
-Went to Jackson park, Japanese garden etc
-Walked Museum Campus a little bit 
This was the hardest day cause we kept getting lost… we walked so much! And then we got a taxi (not uber this time) when we wanted to go from 14 Paris to Jackson park and we ended up telling him to just drop us off wherever. We got into his vehicle and he didn’t follow the route then when we mapped it ourselves and realized we were too far from where he wanted to drop us off at, and when we told him he said that we entered the wrong address on purpose to it could be cheaper. We were like ok cool thanks we’d rather walk than deal with this 
-Later that night we went to LH Rooftop. Didn’t even get drinks but the view was everything!!! 

Fourth Day:
-Walked the RiverWalk — very scenic 
-Walked to Grant park to see the fountain etc. 
-Didn’t have time to visit the Art Institute but I went to the gardens 
-Then I got on the bus to go back towards La Salle… and ended up on 24th and Balbo street cause I got on the bus going in the opposite direction. The bus driver told me to get off, cross the sreet and get on the next bus. I must admit that I was a bit scared cause I didn’t see much activity around and idk the area. 
-The we got Lou Malnatis pizza - it was very disappointing lol I know better based on reviews but my sis wanted it 
-Then we transferred over to Lincoln park and went to the Zoo and conservatory 
-We went to Art Effect on Armitage 
-We went to several shops in Lincoln Square 
-We had dinner at Ciccio Mio and it was the best meal I’ve had during my stay 

Last Day: 
-Did a little shopping on Mag Mile
-Transferred over to Armitage (again) because I really wanted to visit the little quirky shops there 
-Then we did WNDR museum — super underwhelming but my sister wanted to 

I wish I had planned out the food better but I was more interested in seeing and doing things. 

All the horror stories I heard abt Chicagoans being rude turned out to be false. People were so nice and helpful. Not everyone was super smily but they were nice and they even say hi when passing you on the streets. 

Overall I think Chicago is a great city to visit and I can’t wait to be back!

Wife (26f) and I (28m)Moving are to Chicago soon! ( extremely excited ) We would love help with any and all possible advice please?,"Hi Y’all!! My wife (26f) and I (28m) are relocating to Chicago in less than 7 months and we are in desperate need for any and all advice y’all can give! She works part/full time the live theater and film industry ( lighting design, pyrotechnics, production management, touring, stage hand etc……) and also finishing college while I’m in the military and also moonlighting in live theater and film ( Stunt/Fight choreographer, director, actor/comedian etc……) as well as occasionally working private events as a private chef. We both do a whole lot of random things in our respective careers 😂😂. After active duty, we plan on staying while I finish college. Here’s what we need help with!!! (Any possible information matter how small y’all might think it is a huge stress relief) 

1. What are some areas to look to rent that within our budget ( 2800-3000 ) while also having our pets. We have cats and a dog ( under 50 lbs ).
What are the main places we should avoid? 
We’re also more than willing to live just outside the city as well.

2. What is the general cost of living and is having our cars is worth it? 

3. What are the best places to work / what are the best ideas on how to break into the theatre and music scenes ( technical theatre mainly )? Both of us are pretty set in the sheer amount of experience in our fields and in general don’t find it to difficult to get work in most areas, but it’s is always difficult to start in a new area. Especially in one like Chicago where it is heavily implied to be one of the best cities in America for live entertainment ( generally second only to NYC ). Any and all possible advice on this is especially heavily appreciated !!! 

4. What is life actually like there? I know it’s cold AF in the winter with a metric F*** ton of snow and it’s decent and warm in the summer. What should we prepare for while living there? What is general pace of the city? (Examples being; what time do most places close, how loud is the residential areas ,to walk or not to walk , and things of that nature ) 

5. What are some good local businesses to look out for? We especially would love of any local bookstores and game shops that y’all would actually recommend.

6. What is Chicago culture like!? Any specific Chicago native things we should know? What are the most fun and interesting places or things to go to/do (both tourist and non-tourists)? Also ,in general,how friendly/ not friendly are the people ? What to do/say or what not to say/do in social situations that wouldn’t be commonplace in other areas of the country? Stuff like how you shouldn’t say “Go Pats” in a NYC bar or how gettin called a “Yank” or “Yankee” is an insult in the Deep South. 
This one is pretty big for us. We generally have a harder time making friends because we’re both pretty introverted and we’re trying to fix that 😂. We don’t want it to take another 2 years for us to feel confident/comfortable enough in the area to go out and try making any friends …..again. 

7. I know y’all’s food scene is amazing! What are some of y’all’s best recommendations for eateries that wouldn’t be found by just a casual search?

8. Lastly what should we know about the city itself? Where should we avoid at night / what are the big danger areas to look out for? What are the safest areas ? What are common dilemmas? What are some big praises you have for the city? How bad is traffic ? Most importantly what are the main recommendations for grocery and general stores?

We are ridiculously nervous for this move but we are also extremely excited to be moving to what is essentially our dream city!!! 

Thank y’all’ for taking the time to read this!!! I know it is a lot but again absolutely ANY possible advice is greatly appreciated!!!



P.s I know this is a long post already but I have one more. This one is very niche, mostly for working/ former working theatre folk , but again any info is welcome and this one is nowhere near as pressing.

Any advice on which college should we focus on attending in the area ? ( Technical theatre and Acting/directing respectively ) 

We both just want to finish our degrees so we can teach full-time at the collegiate level.
We have both been burnt by attending / working in un-characteristically shitty programs. Ones that want/need, but unfortunately just don’t have, the resources for their students. Really only choosing them due to the fact they were the some of the few in the area that had the programs and that they allowed my wife to attend for free because I was an adjunct.
One of the main reasons we chose Chicago is due to the future ability, and the unfortunate self-satisfying desire from both of us, to finish our degrees . 

Due to the military, money is not a high factor in this decision . We are mostly just in debate of which one each of us should try for. 

Edit: Thank y’all so far!!! Just clarifying one thing, I am still active duty for a few years. Due to this we can afford to just live on my income alone during that time. 

Edit 2: We have not visited yet as I got my orders yesterday. As soon as we can we plan on making a trip out to visit / scope the area. We both have lived in different major cities for different periods of our lives ( NYC for 2yrs, Orlando for 4 ). We are leaving a much smaller area though with this move ( Newport, RI )",AskChicago,0,1751601753.0,32,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1lr9bio/wife_26f_and_i_28mmoving_are_to_chicago_soon/

How safe is it for me to travel alone as a girl to Chicago for a concert?,"I’m going to a concert in Chicago later in October. I am planning on going alone since I only brought one ticket.

Honest thoughts about Bronzeville concerning safety (specifically for women)?,"Edit #1 9/8/25: I added that I read posts in this subreddit from 3-5 ish years ago with similar questions and am wondering if anything has changed since then. I read the neighborhood notes from the subreddit. I am also in a group on Facebook for women based in Chicago and so far a few women said they have enjoyed living there and feel safe. 

Edit #2 9/8/25: Corrected statement about Hyde Park being a 10 minute walk from the house. It is actually a 32 minute walk and a 7 minute car ride and 16 minutes away by public transit. 

Hi! My boyfriend and I are looking to move to buy a house in Bronzeville. The house is about a 7-minute drive to Hyde Park. I’ve read older posts dated a few years ago similar to this one regarding the safety of Bronzeville, and was wondering what your thoughts are and if anything has changed since I read those older posts. 

We have done a little bit of research on the area to evaluate what kind of crime may be present. I would be likely living there by myself to settle in for a few months while my boyfriend moves everything from a different state entirely. I’m wanting to know how safe it is for women to walk around by themselves (while of course following basic safety tips such as not looking completely clueless and not walking around late at night). 

I read that the Green line is alright during the day but that it can get dicey at night. 

Please give your honest feedback about the area. I am new to Chicago aside from having visited a handful of times, and while I do have some general understandings of what areas to avoid, I am especially curious about Bronzeville. My understanding is that Bronzeville has a significant history within Chicago. 

Thank you!

How intense is Fright Fest at Great America?,"My boyfriend, sister and I are scheduled to take three 10 year olds to Great America on Saturday. The plan is to be there from 2:00-7:30 pm. We made this plan without doing much reading about Fright Fest.

I finally did some research and am a little concerned about the scare zones. Partially for the kids, but my sister and boyfriend are pretty jumpy and would not do well with jump scares or being chased.

I read that the scare zones are on the way to some of the rides. The biggest ride we’ll go on is the Demon. Otherwise it’ll be a lot of spinning rides, the Whizzer and the big ship ride. Can we do rides and avoid the scare zones? Do the No Boo necklaces really work or are they hard for the actors to see in the moment? 

Update: Adding this in case someone looking for similar info finds this. We walked around to rides for about two hours after the scary zones started. We all had no boo necklaces which seemed effective (except for an actor who rolled up on one of the kids and growled “turn it off” at her). 

What we didn’t really think about is how other people would be reacting to the actors. It was very dark and groups of people were running/jumping to get away from the actors. We had to bob and weave to get out of the way. And seeing groups of people running while screaming was jarring, especially in these times. Even though our conscious brains knew exactly what was happening, it still set off major fear reactions in the adults. 

The decorations/set dressing was awesome but you can see most of it when it’s still light out. 

I don’t know if we’ll ever go again but if we do, we’ll stick to the daytime hours. ",AskChicago,0,1761187708.0,7,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1ods43o/how_intense_is_fright_fest_at_great_america/
commute from ogilvie to north chicago?,"I've scoped out the Metra train and it looks like it would be 1 hour 45 minutes total if I'm walking to the station and from the station to my destination. 1 hour 20 minutes if I am riding my bike. 

I do have a car and considered this as well but have heard horror stories about the rush hour traffic. Google says between 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes by car in the morning, 50 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes in the evening. It gets better the closer to 6pm I get. 

  
Which would you do? Are there any alternate routes that avoid traffic coming from west loop to North Chicago?

The Metra sounds nice but looking at videos of the inside it doesn't seem like the greatest place to sit for 1.5 hours. If they had outlets I could plug into that's obviously a game changer because then I could do stuff on my computer to kill time. Alternatively driving has the potential to be a shorter ride (if google maps estimation is correct) but far more boring and will feel longer because I'm driving versus getting work done or reading a book or playing a game. 

  
If I were to drive in the middle of the night to North Chicago, it'd be a 40 minute drive. Zero traffic, I can't make it a shorter commute than that. If I can get my commute close to this guaranteed, that'd be ideal. 

Let me know what y'alls thoughts are on riding the Metra, especially for that long - in comparison to driving instead. Particularly if you know any side streets I could take that would avoid a lot of traffic.

One night (tonight) and one day with 2 little girls…,"
My 3 and 5 year old and I are in Chicago for the next 24 hours…. Silly story but getting into Chicago at 5pm, staying at the Drake Hotel (my dad insisted/paid for it because we are picking up my brother tomorrow at 5pm from O’Hare).

So looking for easy with kids dinner and lunch recs… as well as things to do. My plan was Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum but idk if other spots might be more fun. My 5yo is obsessed with Ancient Egypt and Greece. They love art and animals and dinosaurs and princesses, etc but we live in Houston and have great museums (childrens museums and a Color Factory) as well. 

I personally like fun/funky/interactive art installations (they did Meow Wolf over Spring Break and crushed). Its gonna be hot but didnt bring swimsuits so dont want to do beach/splash pads.

Food-wise they love pizza (more thin crust gals than deep dish but open to spots bonus points if near the Drake and quick-ish), Mexican food, typical American kid crap (burgers, shakes, fries, tendies, etc), and they LOVE breakfast. Diners, pancakes/eggs, etc.

What you got?!

EDIT: thank yall so much for all the recs!!! 

We did Pistores for pizza last night (no one recommended but Eater… I wasn’t impressed), walked to Tempo Cafe at 7:30am, stopped to talk to alllll the puppies, Lincoln Park Zoo (found street parking!), El Tragon Taqueria (bomb gas station quesadillas, horchata, and tortas), Cloud Gate/Millennium Park/Maggie Daley Playground, and Art Institute (saw the Greek/Roman sculptures, Georgia OKeefe, and Ryan Learning Center!!!)

An uptick in crime on East Division street- Join me in emailing Brian Hopkins?,"In the past few months, there’s been a major rise in crime along East Division Street, especially between State and Lake Shore Drive. With all the congestion near Dearborn and State, more people are walking or calling Ubers home around Astor &amp; Division — and that area has turned into a hotspot for robberies and assaults. Criminals are clearly targeting people who are walking alone or leaving bars.

My boyfriend was recently the victim of an attempted robbery at 11:30 PM , not even that late for a weekend. It’s unacceptable that we can’t feel safe walking in our own neighborhood. I sent the following message to Alderman Brian Hopkins and encourage others to do the same or speak out:

Subject: Urgent Request for Increased Security on East Division Street

Dear Alderman Hopkins,

I’m writing as a concerned resident of the Gold Coast neighborhood regarding the alarming spike in crime along East Division Street, particularly between State Street and Lake Shore Drive.

Since the recent openings of the Galleria Club and Gold Coast Social, our neighborhood has experienced a troubling increase in robberies, assaults, and even murders. What was once a quiet and safe residential area has become unrecognizable—and unsafe.

It is unacceptable that residents no longer feel safe walking in their own neighborhood. I am asking you to take immediate action by: •	Increasing the presence of police or private security patrols during evening and late-night hours •	Implementing a curfew or stricter enforcement of loitering and noise ordinances for nightlife venues •	Re-evaluating the licenses and community impact of establishments contributing to this unsafe environment

I hope you will treat this issue with the urgency it deserves before further harm is done. We need leadership that protects residents and restores peace to our community.

⸻

If you’ve experienced anything similar or are just tired of feeling unsafe in this neighborhood, please speak up or contact Alderman Hopkins. We need pressure from the community to get real change.",AskChicago,11,1750037574.0,18,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1lcglpt/an_uptick_in_crime_on_east_division_street_join/
Does anyone want a trip report after my last post asking itinerary feedback?,"A while ago I asked this sub for some itinerary feedback and I'm thinking that maybe y'all want to know about my trip here!

Best hotdog award goes to:
Maxwell St Depot. Loved the grilled onions!

Best place to eat goes to:
The cafe in the art institute. I snagged a bite off my husband's burger and it was so good! The outdoor seating was just really great as well and we snagged a table before they got really busy. It was so relaxing.

Hotel Hyatt regency 4/5:
I don't understand how a 5 star hotel has a $25 daily fee? But then gave us a $25 nightly restaurant credit? At that point why have a fee? I don't know. I don't usually book fancy 5 star hotels. Also they have someone checking out the room once a day even if you don't request room service. They messed with the thermostat and scared the daylights out of me when they left a hair product gift on a table. Very weird. The view of the river/lake from the room is nice but I'm thinking that if we were to come back I would love to stay in a local brick apartment situation in a neighborhood by a train station.

Activities we did out of a 5 rating.
Architecture boat ride 5/5.
Loved learning about the city and now I can say I have a favorite building!

Rate Field 5/5.
Loved watching the game here. I think it's cool how there are fireworks for every home run. We went during a Comiskey bobblehead day and they had historic footage on the big screen. Which was really cool for us baseball nerds.

Wrigley Field 100/5.
It's a must do. What can I say? It's so crazy to think of the age of the stadium here and how many people watched a game here. And it's even crazier to think about all the baseball stars that played. Easily the most engaged fans I've ever seen at a ball game. We were all standing on a potential strike out pitch. What was really cool was the game winning songs/flags. They definitely don't show that on TV at home! I'm really glad that the Cubs won because I feel like we could have missed out on that experience.

The art institute/cloud gate combo 5/5
I'm a bit of an art nerd and I love the roman statue exhibit. My husband isn't really too big of a fan but he had a good time following me around and explaining art pieces to him and the significance of it. We walked around here for SIX HOURS and we still didn't see everything.

Regrets:
I needed better shoes and a better jacket. I was delusional with converse and a zip up fleece.

We were walking around China town between the park and grabbing a few drinks at Reggie's trying to create an appetite to eat in China town and unfortunately we couldn't get an appetite going.

General thoughts:
The transportation is amazing. Never had any issues. Only qualm is it's busy after a game which duh of course it is.

Chicago truly is massive. It almost feels like it's 3 different cities in one. It makes my big town in my state look like a tiny peanut.

People here are honestly very nice. I've done city living before and generally you do as the Romans, don't block a sidewalk, don't stop randomly, don't be in the way while taking pictures, and don't speak to strangers unless you're spoken to. But the strangers that we did chatted with loved the city and also loved how we were having such a great time. Someone on the red line was really appreciative that we weren't sticking to one area of the city - our goal was to truly see it all. My aching feet is proof haha.

Elderly low-income South Shore apt.: dangerous?,"Sorry for this 3 a.m. rambling post...

I saw on Craigslist Chicago an elderly/disabled 62 and older low-income apartment,  charging 30% of one's income. 

I am very low income, so should qualify. 

From pictures I've seen around various internet sites, the building looks low income -- no surprise there.

But I don't mind spartan, just not dangerous. 

It's at 6900 S. Crandon Ave/Street.  Zip code 60649.  The ad calls it the South Shore neighborhood (or is South Shore an area more than a neighborhood?).

Yes, I've done online searches, and it's far from the Loop and northside by public transit.

Even a CVS or Walgreens seems a mile or more walk, but I think an Aldi is near but no Jewel, Trader Joe's or Whole Foods Market in such a zip code, unsurprising.

Seems kind of close to the Lake and beaches and a cultural center...but still maybe a hassle to regulary access on foot?

Maybe a branch library nearby?

...

I have lived in the Boston area all my adult life and enjoy and appreciate its relatively high quality of living, despite the high cost of rents.

But I might need to relocate to Chicago for a friend, and I've always liked the ""desirable""  parts of Chicago on my two very brief visits, in 1994 and 2011.

I'm a hockey fan, so would cheer for the Blackhawks!  I guess this neighborhhood cheers for the White Sox, not the Cubs?

I am a gay, white, husky male, somewhat strong, but can't really fight well if attacked.  I have a Bachelor's degree, but have done blue collar jobs most of my life. Will I not fit in in this zip code? Maybe not too gay friendly around there?

Oh, I can't afford your north side gay-friendly neighborhoods.

Just stay away from that vicinity, or might be worth it for low rent and to live alone?

Problem is I like to ride the safer parts of Boston subways and trolleys...whether for errands or even fun and relaxation!...of course I encounter some disturbed people, but I can tolerate them if not dangerous. If I nod off in the daytime wnd even nights on the parts of our transit I use, I don't fear my safety.

Yes, I understand I couldn't safely do that in much of Chicago's transit system, at leasf at night.

And I like to stroll the safer neighbors in Boston and nearby...even at night, and I feel comfortable.  

But not sure I could safely walk from the Chicago public transit station or bus stop to this address at night, but daytime should be fine? And I think I read it's not that near an actual subway line but closer to a ""Metra?"" line into downtown?  Hmmm...

Thanks!

...oh, and I'm not sure if I should post such questions in the main Chicago sub or here.

New Yorker Moving to Chicago,"I’ve (F27) only known NYC all my life. Yes, I have traveled but I’ve never lived anywhere outside of Brooklyn. My husband (M28), moved to NY from CA when he started college. We started dating in our sophomore year of college and he decided to permanently live in NY to be close with me after graduation. We just got married in March of this year, but we have been living in a (walk-in) basement since the start of the pandemic. We are just 3 blocks away from my parents. As an only child, my parents have had strict hold over me, such as not letting me dorm for college, tracking my location, etc. I think all that plus past emotional trauma with my dad being controlling over my social life has led me to develop anxiety.

They only let me move out with my now-husband before the pandemic because they didn’t want me to keep “being exposed to the outside” whenever I walked over to my husband’s apartment in the morning (every day) and come back to my parents’ house at night. 

Fast forward to today, my husband recently applied to law school and got accepted with a full ride to one of the schools in Chicago! We just got this news literally last week and we’ve been so excited - we can finally move out of NYC to be on our own and be independent for once as newlyweds. We broke the news to his family and my team at work. I’ve been avoiding having a sit-down with my parents because I’m scared of the backlash or them being upset. We both deserve the freedom. To get out of this basement, live our life elsewhere. We decided to break the news to them this weekend (tomorrow!!!). We plan to move at the end of July, so that’s pretty soon.

I’m super nervous but sorry for this long rant. I guess what I’m asking is…

- As a New Yorker, how should I prepare for our big move to Chicago, both mentally and physically?
- We have no family or friends there but my husband’s family lives about 3 hours by car from Chicago. He currently works remote and will be doing his law program at night. What are some suggestions for exploring Chicago, making new friends, finding new hobbies?

"Early 40s/F Fine Art Photographer, visiting Chicago Mid Sept. What should I remove/add/replace from my options?","Hi, Y'all. 

I'm a dark botanical photographer from Montreal, QC. Hoping you can provide some insight on my upcoming trip. I really love all kinds of art and anything weird or obscure, dive bars . I also love creative and delicious food/wine, local beer and a well made cocktail without sweetness.   
  
I'll be traveling solo mid-ish September and have been furiously Googling all the things I'd like to do and now I have the problem of too many things on my list.   
  
I'll be there for 5 days but leave on a Saturday, so I don't have a weekend in the city.  Mostly looking for things to cull from my list based on the following:

I'll be staying at a hostel near lincoln park. part of what I love about travelling is the temporary friends you make for the day/evening in bars, cafes, solo dining, etc.  
  
 I have 2 modes, one where I am super engaged and chatty and the other where I feel incredibly uncomfortable and want to crawl out of my skin and they largely depend on vibes of the people there. :)

 I'm in my early 40's (present a bit younger) and mildly witchy/alt/artsy (wear mostly dark or black clothing, tattoos, etc)  and am looking for places that are good for either talking to bartenders (during the day when they're not busy) or regulars that are friendly and welcoming in neighborhoods outside Lincoln Park. Would also love to talk to other artists/fine art photographers/creatives.

 I probably won't be doing late nights with heavy drinking, but would like to see local live acts close to my hostel (near Lincoln Park)

 For the evenings, I would, in large prefer to stay around the Lincoln Park area where I could walk back to my hostel, but if there's a spot I shouldn't miss or that's close to one of the restaurants on my list, I'm open.

These are the places/touristy stuff/shopping I have so far. Are there any things that I might have missed or should skip? 

Also, for any photographers, should I bother bringing a wide angle lens based on street configurations/architectural detail etc or will I be okay with a 55-250mm f/4-5.6? 

Based on the above, will I feel uncomfortable at any of the bars/restaurants on my list having a drink/dining alone?

Tourist Stuff:

-Architectural boat tour (for the photography, open to alternatives)  
-MCA  
-Museum Of Contemporary Photography

Dining Solo for Breakfast/lunch and dinner. 

Only two I know for sure I must go to are Tyzub and Indienne. Open for opinions to the rest.

  Not veg but am 'carry an EpiPen allergic' to crustaceans (not mollusks or fish) and prefer not having to ask for substitutions for tasting menus or worrying about potential accidents/contamination/hidden crustacean (nam phrik kapi, bouillabaisse, some fish stocks, etc)  :

-RR #1  
-Komoda

"New Grad Moving to Chicago (Transit, Airport, Safety, Green Spaces, etc.)","Hi everyone! Like some previous posts here, I am considering moving to Chicago soon. To focus the discussion a bit (and help you all think about recommendations), I have identified some of my must-haves and hopes and some previous research I have done.

About Me:

* Remote job, but occasionally will need to travel domestically (sometimes outside of the Chicago area)
* Mid-20s living alone

Must haves:

* Budget: One-bedroom apartment under $1500. (edit: is this reasonable or too low?)
* Public transit: CTA (bus and/or the L) is a must, Metra would be nice but not necessary.
* Decent access to airports: I will be traveling occasionally as a part of my job, including going to airports. I prefer to be closer to O'Hare because I also use that airport to fly home. Think 75 minutes to O'Hare with transit max. For Midway, I am less concerned right now.
* Safety: Generally I am hearing that other than some south neighborhoods, places are safe as long as I avoid a couple of blocks in any neighborhood. Correct me if I am wrong for the neighborhoods you are aware of.
* Groceries: Walking or transit distance - 15 minutes.
* Retail: A good number of restaurants, shops, and cafes. It does not have to be like downtown, but I would like to eat out sometimes!
* Green space: Generally I would like to have sidewalks that have green space in the residential parts of town so that I don't go crazy. Some good parks nearby are a plus!

Hopes: Access to gyms nearby

I also had some time to visit some of the neighborhoods that people mentioned on this thread or others during the day. Here are my (personal) reactions. Feel free to comment on my observations as well, as I just walked around in the following areas:

* Edgewater/Uptown: A good hub for young people and a good mix of families and elders. Having Lake Michigan is nice, quiet residential areas, and good pockets of restaurants and shops. The only con here is that going to O'Hare in particular takes more than an hour.
* Old Town: I saw more housing complexes than individual houses (just observation). There's good stuff to do in Wells Street (pretty good and lively).
* Palmer Square / Logan Square: Less red brick buildings south of Logan Square, more red brick in Palmer Square; Boulevards! Heard that these areas are on the expensive side...?
* Avondale: There are houses of various styles and colors, which I liked. Good amount of green space.
* Jefferson Park: I went south of the Metra/CTA transit center and the Jefferson Park (park) is a bit barren so I personally didn't like that. I also saw the north side has a better variety of houses than the south side (splitting by that transit center).

These following neighborhoods I did not have a chance to go to: Wicker Park / Bucktown area and Lake View.

This is a lot of information, but hope you all have something to start your discussions. I really appreciate all your help!",AskChicago,0,1716817673.0,28,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1d1rx96/new_grad_moving_to_chicago_transit_airport_safety/
Where can I park in Rogers Park without being towed?,"Help needed--parking around Rogers Park

UPDATE: I went to a currency exchange and got my parking stickers. So easy! Thanks all for your help. 

TLDR I have a car and I need to park it on the street as near to Loyola Ave as possible without getting towed or playing musical cars every 2-4 hours parking and reparking, or paying exorbitant structure fees. I am unwilling to sell my car--long story but an absolute dealbreaker.

Context: 

Hello all, I've just moved to the Loyola area. I love it, I can walk to the lake (!), but parking is such a pain--seems like it's all a tow zone at random hours so you can never be safe. 😂 It was $119 to stay in a structure for 7 days but that's not sustainable.

I've applied for my parking sticker and should hear back within 10 days, but it's the gov so I expect they'll draw out the process for weeks. That's how it is in Michigan, maybe it's better here. In the meantime, is there an area you know of that's safe to park in either all the time or in longer blocks than 2-4 hours? Maybe a side street in a suburbanish area (bearing in mind I'm a petite woman who would be walking alone very late at night at times so can't go too far out of radius).

For the Swifties next weekend,"Friendly neighborhood Uber driver here with some unsolicited BUT possibly time saving advice. 

Whatever you do, try not to get an Uber or Lyft directly to and from Soldier Field for the concert. The traffic will crush your soul. And even more devastating will be trying to get a ride afterwards. Just don’t. 

Here’s what you’re gonna do. It’s very simple. And it will save you so much time. 

Set your destination for a tiny little green space in the prairie district called “Battle of Ft Dearborn park” (I was gonna upload a pic of it on google maps but I forgot this sub doesn’t allow photos). It’s an unassuming little park, not much goes on except for one beautiful shortcut to Soldier Field. 

Follow the signs for the 18th street pedestrian bridge. There will be a path. The bridge will take you over the metra tracks and dump you in a parking lot across from Soldier Field. From there it’s a short walk to the stadium. Total walking time from the park to the stadium is 10-15 depending on your stride (and your excitement as you laugh at all the donkeys stuck on the highway)

When you’re done just do the reverse and call an Uber or Lyft when you’re over the bridge back into the neighborhood. It’s very safe and very quiet. More and more people are learning about this easy pickup but not enough to make it unmanageable. If you find hordes of Swifties waiting at the park, there are multiple condo/apartment towers you can schlep to and call from there. 

I’ll be out of town so I won’t be driving those nights, but y’all be safe and have fun. Lmk in the comments if you have any questions

Edit: The first comment made a super great point. It escaped my mind. Take care of that neighborhood if you do decide to make the trek over. Be respectful of the residents that live there.

Edit Edit: an awesome Redditor who lives in the neighborhood dropped some really valuable information that I didn’t know about, or have experienced dropping ppl off and picking them up. You most likely won’t get dropped off at the park due to street closures, BUT getting to the park and over the bridge is still easy if you go to the prairie district. Still beats sitting in traffic.",AskChicago,179,1685337757.0,16,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/13ulsas/for_the_swifties_next_weekend/
Strapped Up After Dark: Navigating Chicago’s Streets Safely,"Hey Chicago,

In light of recent discussions and my own experiences walking home late from work, I’ve been pondering the myriad ways we, as a community, keep safe in our bustling city, especially after dark. This isn’t just about me; it’s about all of us navigating our streets when the sun goes down. Whether it’s from a bar shift, a late night at the office, or just an evening out, how do you ensure your personal safety in a non-lethal manner that adheres to our city’s laws?

Let’s broaden the conversation: What strategies, gadgets, or practices have you found effective for staying safe? Also, are there community resources or classes that have been particularly helpful? I believe sharing our collective wisdom can not only offer practical advice but also strengthen our community’s sense of security and camaraderie.

Looking forward to hearing your insights and tips. Let’s make Chicago nightlife safer for everyone.",AskChicago,0,1709671312.0,22,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1b7fyhd/strapped_up_after_dark_navigating_chicagos/
Trying to move to Chicago from out of state in May/June - where in Lakeview would be a good spot for me?,"I’m sorry, I know there’s a lot of these posts. My girlfriend and I are moving to IL from out of state. We visited last year, fell in love with it and have some family ties nearby. 

After a lot of thinking on the right neighborhood, we settled on Lakeview East. We can’t visit extensively right now, but heard it’s a really safe/solid choice to spend your first few year in the city, and has basically everything you need. Sold!

I guess now the question is determining where. Honestly, I don’t want to be in the heart of the chaos, (like in the more fratty areas near Wrigleyville - although I love the Cubs!). I’m close to 30 and really value a quiet home life, but within proximity of a vet, restaurants, public transit, etc. I’m not a huge drinker but I like trying new foods, I’d like to be by the lake where there’s more greenery and places to hang out with my dog. I think safety is sort of number one, and just being near a good CTA stop and some good lightning at night. 

I don’t know if that’s a lot to go off of. I work from home and am about $80k ish per year. My girlfriend is a bit more extroverted, it’ll be her first time living in a city. She wants opportunities to make friends and she’ll need transit for work. She’s also expressed a desire to be near some greenery, but also wants to be close by to bars and restaurants. And like I mentioned, we have a small dog so any areas very close by where he can walk around and hang out is good. I think being around people like us is ideal….sort of in between college grads and parents, I guess. 

I know how annoying I must sound here. I guess I’m just struggling. I’m trying to find and avoid the right property managers (Beal), I’m trying to find maybe the best parts of Lakeview for my personality (I think we both value quiet evenings indoors but being in proximity to fun stuff, although we know being in the city = more noise overall, which is fine - mostly just trying to avoid the young 20s party scene). 

Does anyone maybe have any suggestions on parts of the neighborhood that may be good? Streets, realtors, property groups, anything? Honestly any help is appreciated I’ve been going through a lot the past few months and I’ve tried to do as much research as I can, but actually being able to get some more suggestions from people there would be so so helpful

How (un)safe is Pink + blue line to O’Hare 11pm-2am with big bags?,"So I’ll  to go to O’Hare from California pink line then take the blue line at the loop. I have two bags and will go alone.
For what I’ve read the best is stick to the first car and that it won’t be pleasant anyways.

Is it really “unsafe”? Like what I’ve really find on the posts is like “better Uber” “better if you are not alone” “better the first car” “better not do it” “I wouldn’t risk it” but like I haven’t heard a real reason more than anxiety or fear, does something bad actually happens at this hours on the trains?

Also what you think is the best/safest(?) hour to do the ride between 11pm to 2am? I planned first arriving early leaving at 11pm but on one post I saw people felt a little better early morning than late night, so now I’m considering too, what you think?




——————————— My experience with pink line at midnight and blue line at midnight ———————————

Update of my experience doing this. 
Sorry it became a story time so conclusion: At the end I never felt unsafe and it wasn’t bad for me, but remember there’s always risk and if you have ride alternatives it’s always better to pay a little extra for your safety.

——
I post this here because on my search of pink line at midnight and blue line at midnight there weren’t really many experiences or at least not recent and I’m just gonna put mine here in hope someone else can check it out and see ONE person experience doing this around midnight. (Again this was just MY experience and it doesn’t mean it’s gonna be the same for you, I would hope this was easy and safe for everyone, but there’s still many doubts and people feel unsafe)

So here goes my experience at midnight from California pink line going to Clark and lake and then the blue line to O’Hare on a Sunday.

First what you need to check is what’s your best option, if you have the chance of using Uber/lift or whatever, I wouldn’t doubt about it if I could really afford it (maybe some folks think that if you can travel you have an extra $70 for a ride, but it’s not at all everyone’s option)

Then if you decide to go for public transportation then check options of buses and trains maybe it’s not great traveling on this with luggage but it won’t be for that long and if you think you can deal with that then you go and check the actual times that certain bus/train is working at that certain day, so in my case the last pink train was at 1am and the first at 5am(wouldn’t have worked for me to wait that long)
Then you decide what time to actually leave, I really think, and maybe it’s not a generalized thought, that always better the first train in the morning I.e.5am because there’s might be more people taking it for early shifts or something, or the earliest you can at night so maybe not wait until 1am and this is not just about security but also I’ve read that sometimes the trains at night just don’t arrive and people wait for hours or just go get an Uber because there’s no other option.

You will have to be rested cause you will have to wait long cold hours at the airport on the floor while taking care of your luggage, or just be a warrior and go through the pain with no sleeping, crying and praying. lol

Now how it actually went for me:
I decided to start with this the earliest I could that end up being 11:10pm. I had to walk with my 1 very big luggage, 1 carry on and 1 personal item all over the weight or dimensions limit. It was dark but I didn’t cross paths with any other human being until I was at the pink line station door at 11:20, tbh this 10 minutes where the ones I was actually the most afraid but nothing happened.

Then I had to wait like 10 minutes by myself, on the platform, again there was no one and I didn’t feel unsafe at any moment I actually expected there to be a drunk guy sleeping or something, but nothing.
I got to the first car of the L around 11:30 there where another 6 people with me minding their own business and once again no drunk or drugged guy, no crazy people either.
(AGAIN!!! This was MY experience I really think in most cases at any hour there will be someone making people uncomfortable or at least sleeping idk)
I arrived to Clark and lake before 11:50pm
And the worst part of all this journey was having to get my bag from that platform to the blue line. 
I have to say on the station there were like 2 or 3 guys sleeping but there was more people and even some police officers, so I really felt safe I think I just got lucky… more than usual.

Again it was horrible getting bags down even though there were this smelly slow elevator (you actually have to take 2 of this but hey, there’s at least the option!)
BUT it almost make me lose the blue line train. As soon as the door of the elevator opened, the train audio of doors closing was playing and I rushed to the nearest car of the train, which was the last, so I was getting ready for it to be a really bad experience. But there when I entered at least half of the seats were taken and actually just one homeless guy sleeping there and everyone else minding their own business with their headphones or on their phones, so again I felt safer knowing I wasn’t there alone with this big bags. During the way to the airport pay of the people left and just 3 of us make it to O’hare (including the sleeping guy) I arrived there were cleaners and some other people leaving from other cars and then that was it. (I counted people sleeping on the train cause I had to walk and there were just like 7 on the whole train)


Look, once again it was my experience and I think I was lucky I didn’t go through anything weird or crazy people, I honestly wasn’t really afraid of getting killed or mugged cause as I said when I placed the question I really don’t think it is that frequent that something like that happens, I know it does exceptional times but it’s not the rule. The time I’ve spent in Chicago I’ve seen crazy things/people on the trains at mostly every hour, and honestly think that there won’t ever be something like 100% guaranteed safety travel, but I also think this is the common rule for almost everywhere around the world, so yes the safest option will always be Uber or similars and if you have that option it’s always better not to risk it, but if you really have to go and do this midnight rides then chances are you gonna be okay, but there will always be the risk, also sadly from past experiences I’ve seen and I think women are more targeted, so it’s always better if you have someone to do this with and not by yourself, I honestly think this will give you a little extra layer of safety. Just always be aware of your surroundings, don’t hesitate to ask for help if it comes to it and if you have the chance to a safer ride always take it. If there’s no other option chances are you’ll be okay, but it’s never 100% guaranteed.

Planning a trip to Chicago but our stay will overlap with the Mexican Independence Day - how much will it interfere with being able to get anywhere Downtown?,"Hello!  My spouse and I are planning on visiting Chicago for the first time in September.  Currently, we are booked at the Hilton Chicago on Michigan Ave. for six nights.  We wanted to stay Downtown since a lot of the sights we are interested in seeing are in the Downtown area, and we are not planning on hassling with renting a car and driving - we plan to walk to where we can, and use Uber/Lyft or possibly public transportation where it might be a bit too far to walk.

We didn’t realize there was a big celebration for the Mexican Independence Day on September 16th until I saw something mentioned about it when I was researching more into things to do while we are there, which falls right smack dab in the middle of our planned trip.  It is my understanding that the actual parades are not in the Downtown area, but that a large amount of cars tend to converge on Downtown streets celebrating and create a lot of gridlock, making it difficult or impossible to get thorough traffic.

What I’m wondering is, how long does the bad traffic in the Downtown area for this holiday typically last?  Does it start the day before (Friday) and extend into Saturday (the actual holiday) and possibly into Sunday too, or is it mostly contained to either the daytime or the evening on Saturday?  I’m thinking we probably won’t want to plan on doing anything that requires traveling by Uber/Lyft when this is going on, or anything time sensitive like dinner reservations.  But will we be able to get anywhere on foot during this time, or will there be large crowds of people jamming the sidewalks, too, and does it tend to get rough?  Should we just plan to stay in our hotel until things calm down?  My spouse typically does not do well in large mass crowds, so if it’s mainly just cars blocking the streets but not people crowding the sidewalks and we’re on foot, he’ll likely be okay, but if it’s like a massive sea of people standing around making it difficult to walk anywhere, we’ll definitely want to stay in.

Since we’ll be there for several days total, I can deal with hanging around the hotel for part of a day or evening to avoid the pandemonium.  But, I don’t want to miss an entire day or more of not being able to get out and about.   If that’s the case, we might change our plans and try to plan a visit some other time (we can cancel our hotel reservation if need be, though I’d hate to as we’ve been looking forward to visiting Chicago for a long time).

I went to a sex club for the first time and experienced matriarchy.,"*EDIT: Hey guys, I can't keep up with all the questions here or in my inbox, so I'm gonna have to tap out. The answers to most of your questions are in the comments, if you look through. If you're looking for a similar club in your area, just do your due diligence and ask around online about it, not all clubs are the same. And don't forget, even in very safe and well-maintained spaces, bad apples can slip through, so please be smart and have fun!*

OK, the title is a bit of a joke. But honestly, the gender dynamics of the space were so different I found it fascinating, and I wanted to write about it.

There will be no sexy details in this post (sorry, pervert guys who will inevitably DM me later. I'm just gonna block). I'm genuinely just really interested in the social space and the culture that developed in the sex club.

I should clarify, i've only been to this one particular club, different clubs may have different cultures. This one is a particularly social space - no loud, pounding music, there's a heated pool where people hang out, and an upstairs area where most of the sex happens, so the sex and the socializing are mostly separated. I've heard it described as a ""social club first, sex club second"". I'm not going to name the club, since I don't represent them. These are just my own thoughts and observations.

I decided to go on my own, partly because I was curious and wanted to challenge myself, but also because at the time I couldn't imagine anything more awkward than taking a friend with me to the sex club (I have since taken several friends with me to the sex club and it's fine.) I promised myself that I would just go there once, as a challenge, and I would leave immediately if I felt unsafe or uncomfortable.

I thought of the sexual politics of a dance club - guys going out to get laid, and then groping, following, pressuring, and generally bullying the women they found there. Bouncers that intervened only in the most obvious and egregious circumstances. Closely guarding my drink and monitoring my girl friends' safety. Despite all the marketing advertising a safe, consent-first space, I just couldn't picture it. How could the presence of sex and nudity produce BETTER behaviour in men? Hard to believe. So I assumed I would be there for an hour tops, check it off the bucket list, and go home.

Instead what i discovered was, when you're a single woman at a sex club, you're basically royalty. Every rule and custom revolves around what women want. For example:

\- Men are not allowed upstairs (where most of the sex happens) without a female escort. Two nights a week, men are not even allowed in the club without a female escort. If your date leaves, and there's no woman there who will agree to stay with you, you have to leave. Women can go when and where they please.  
\-Single women pay a $15 cover. Single men pay $100.  
\- The bouncers and staff are on the BALL when it comes to women's safety. I once stumbled a little bit getting out of the pool, and security was INSTANTLY on me.  ""How much have you had to drink? Has anybody else been near your drink tonight?"" I was literally just clumsy, but I appreciated the check in. I have NEVER had a bouncer take my safety that seriously at a traditional club.  
\- The ask-once-rule. If you are interested in someone, you can ask them ONLY ONCE to go upstairs with you. If they say no, that's it. No pestering, no following.  
\- No touching of any kind - not so much as a pat on the shoulder - without explicit verbal consent. Even watching/staring at other people requires consent.  
\- If you violate any of these rules, the staff is not shy about not just kicking you out, but banning you for life.

These rules are for everyone, but come on... We know who they were thinking of when they made them.

I cannot emphasize enough how every rule and custom is designed and enforced to protect women and eliminate pushy or violent behaviour in men. As a result, unsafe men are far less likely to get in and stay in. Men who feel entitled to women's bodies and attention quickly find that they spent $100 to get banned from a club. With a price tag that high, they are on their best behaviour, because they know that a few words from me can get them kicked out in an instant.

**In the club, I got to experience something I never had before: what it's like to be in a co-ed space where women's needs are central.**  It makes you really realize how much of your life you spend anticipating male violence, and how that anticipation changes your social behavior. How often we laugh at jokes that aren't funny, don't speak up when we dislike something. How carefully we dance around making sure the men around us feel good about themselves, because we don't know what they will do if they feel ""emasculated"".  We do it even when the men around us seem fine, because it becomes a habit.

**When the threat of violence is removed from the equation, women very naturally take on the socially dominant position**. How could we not? Men want us so much more than we want them. They want our attention. They want to impress us. If men can't threaten and harass and intimidate, (or passively benefit from a culture where OTHER men do so) they have to smile and charm and think hard about what we want and how to give it to us.

Without threatening men around, women relax and open up socially. They take up space. They say what they want. And the men listen. The vibe is absurdly upbeat and positive, and more socially open than a typical bar. At a bar, you mostly talk to the people you came with, unless someone is smooth enough to break the ice. At the sex club, people just... talk to whoever's closest. Everyone always seems in a good mood, everyone seems happy to talk to you.

Here's the kicker: even the MEN seem happier without patriarchal dudes around. In the outside world, men worry they will be perceived as gay if they so much as have a drink with an umbrella in it. In the club, I've seen men stand around, butt-ass naked, chatting happily with each other without a moment's ""no homo"" anxiety. There's much less peacocking, much less jostling with each other to be dominant or ""alpha."" They can just relax. In fact, **I've spoken to many men who will happily spend the $100 with no expectation of getting laid that night. They just enjoy the social space that much.**

I think it's over-idealistic to imply that the dynamics of patriarchy just evaporate when you step into a space like this. But this is the closest thing to a matriarchy I've ever experienced. And as a result, everybody is happy, everybody seems to like each other, there is far less conflict or jostling for dominance, and everybody is having lots and lots of sex.

"As the only woman in a concealed carry class, my experience was alarming…","I live in Florida and with everything happening around the country and in my own community, plus the fact that I’m always out biking on trails, my wife and I decided we wanted to become responsible gun owners for self protection.

(Ex things most women already practice like don’t take a shortcut through a dark ally, walk around the block on a well lit path with other people around…)

Meanwhile every man in that room kept challenging him. They were walking through scenarios that made no sense for using a gun and when he told them they’d be in the wrong, they pushed back with lines like, “that doesn’t sit well with me,” or “I’d never let that happen, guess I’m just a hot head.” This is the guy who would be defending them and he was telling them straight up he couldn’t defend those choices.

He explained castle doctrine and stand your ground laws and reasonable person expectations and proportional force. One example was a road rage situation where someone gets out and starts pounding on your hood. You can’t shoot them. You drive away, call the police, anything but that. You only have the right to use deadly force if they enter your vehicle. The men looked genuinely stunned that the correct move was to drive off instead of opening fire.

Another guy talked about walking past someone who was spitting on the ground towards him and glaring at him. He asked if he could have shot him if things escalated like the man spit on him and they go into a fist fight. The lawyer basically said, why on earth would you walk right up to someone who’s already showing you they’re a threat instead of crossing the street or turning around to avoid it completely.

It was wild. I’m a gay woman who works from home and barely interacts with men outside of work, so sitting there listening to this was jarring. I was trying to learn how to avoid danger and using my firearm, and the men were trying to find loopholes to justify killing someone over petty ego moments. My state has over 2 million concealed carry permits issued AND you no longer have to even have a permit. I hope I somehow just ended up with a group of hot heads and this isn’t the norm for men to look for reasons to shoot someone rather than avoiding them…",TwoXChromosomes,11022,1764002013.0,808,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1p5lqac/as_the_only_woman_in_a_concealed_carry_class_my/
I woke up to someone on top of me 22F,"Repost because the old post was removed due to triggering words. Sorry. 
I slept last night by a friend who I trusted. I woke up to his dick inside me. I haven’t showered and I’ve been questioned by the police. He’s been arrested. He said he was dreaming and didn’t mean to. He said he will kill himself. He said he dreamed of having sex with his ex. I will edit this post with more details. I’m really upset and low on energy at the moment. Support would be greatly appreciated. I don’t think I realised what has happened. I normally push things down and repress them. I just want to move on with my life. 

Edit: thank you for the support. He’s 55 btw. I’ve known him since I was 19. 


Edit 2: I’ve been checked forensically and I’ve been checked over at the hospital and I’ve had a rape kit done. I was too scared he would ask me to shower so I lied and said I was going for a walk. I called the police and hid a few streets away from his house. He kept saying he would drive me home, and to come back it’s not safe outside.

Potato Eating A-Hole,"Let me preface this with A) I (33f) am in my luteal phase so my rage knows no bounds and  B) I know this man's (35m) actions were not malicious, just childishly short sighted and selfish.

Yesterday I spent 2 hours meal prepping an entire bag of Little Duos (about 30 potatoes). I boiled them for 15 minutes, made a garlic, thyme, and rosemary brown butter and meticulously measured out 10 grams of shredded cheese for each potato. I then mashed each potato using the back of a glass to be only about a half to a quarter inch thick, drenched them in the butter sauce and popped them in the oven for an hour to crisp. The house smelled INCREDIBLE.

About 5 of those potatoes couldnt fit on the tray so I decided to eat those un mashed ones with a little smoked fish for dinner.

Once the hour was up, I took them out to cool and then boxed them up and put them in the fridge. I was VERY excited to eat them with lunch the following day and did not have any of the finished product at the time.

My partner is a night worker. I told him what I was making before he left for work, let him know I was meal prepping but told him he could have some (key word SOME) when he got home.

Imagine my surprise when I walk into the goddamn livingroom to see the container where I stored 25 smashed potatoes dirty and empty just... sitting on the coffee table. Not in the sink, not in the dish washer. Sitting proudly in the middle of my livingroom.

I want to cry and commit murder. Money, a grocery trip and 2 hours of my time completely disappeared into the bottomless pit of a stomach my careless and negligent partner possesses.

I feel like I have every right to demand he goes back to the store to re buy every ingredient he horked down but IM ALSO RAGING AND HORMONAL!!!

Goooood, days like these I wish I was an 80 year old woman alone in my home with 10 cats.

And no, I wont be breaking up with him over potatoes but hes not gonna like me when he wakes up.

Edit: For a little clarity, he has never done this before. Normally when I meal prep I pre portion and freeze the portions. I will also leave a container unfrozen in the fridge for him to pick through. This time I didnt freeze them as potatoes freeze like grainy bricks of sadness nor did I pre portion as my fridge is teeny and didnt have enough room. I didn't think I would have to tell him not to eat 20 to 25 mini potatoes (cuz who eats that many in one sitting!?) but obviously I should have!

UPDATE:

He is awake and aware of his fuck-up. He was extremely apologetic and will be buying me replacement ingredients and will be making them with me this weekend. He genuinely believed that my container of 20+ taters were ment for him. I pray for his collon.",TwoXChromosomes,2314,1770133824.0,348,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1quvipj/potato_eating_ahole/
"I got into a stranger’s car. I feel ashamed, unsafe, and I don’t understand why I did it.","I’m someone (25F) who mostly keeps to myself. I dress masculine, walk fast, usually look angry, and I’ve /never/ been bothered by men, even walking at night. I think I gave myself a false sense of security because of how I present.

I don’t drive. I walk everywhere, and the other day I was heading home from the supermarket. I had my headphones on but music low enough to still hear traffic.

I was on a quiet road when a car pulled up beside me. A man inside said something- I thought I heard “directions” so I took one headphone off and said, “Pardon?”
He shook his head and waved his hand, and I SHOULD have kept walking.
But I asked again, “Sorry, do you need help?”
He replied that he thought I was someone else, so I gave a polite “Oh, no worries” and started walking again, but then noticed the car was still slowly following me.

I took my headphones off again. He was talking to me, seemed drunk, and said something like:

“Can you PLEASE show me there’s still trust in the world and let me drive you home?”

I refused, as gently as I could, not wanting to escalate anything. But he kept asking. He was driving slowly beside me, pleading.

Another car pulled into the road behind him, so he finally drove forward, I thought “thank fuck that’s over with”.
But moments later, I saw him circle back through a side road and pull up beside me again.
This time, he tried to convince me by telling me where he worked, his full name, said he had a 14-year-old daughter, that he’s had a hard time, and just needed “someone to trust him.” He offered to show me his ID.
For some stupid reason, I stepped toward the car to see the ID. The moment I did, he said “Thank you so much!” and opened the door.

And for some reason I cannot fathom, I got in.

I can’t explain it. I felt pressured. Caught off guard. Like I’d already committed to something just by not walking away sooner.

Once in the car, he said, “You shouldn’t have done that. I have a 14-year-old daughter.”
He told me his mother had died the day before.
He was driving fast. At one point he said, “I bet you thought I was going to rape you.”
I panicked internally but felt like I had to laugh off his jokes and tread carefully.

Luckily, truly by the grace of the universe, roadworks blocked the street and forced him to reroute. I said I lived just around the corner and that here was fine. He protested, made some creepy joke about “taking me where he’d planned all along,” but eventually pulled into a side road and let me out.
I walked home, constantly looking over my shoulder.

But now I’m left reeling.
I feel ashamed. I don’t understand why I got in that car.
I convinced myself I’d never be in a situation like this “I don’t dress feminine, I keep to myself, I don’t entertain men.”

I still don’t understand why I got in that car.
I’ve always believed I wouldn’t fall for something like this. I feel ashamed and stupid.
I told some close friends afterwards and they all said what I was already thinking: That was stupid.
And they’re not wrong. I would’ve said the same thing, too.

But I can’t even follow my own thought process. I don’t know what part of me thought getting in was the right move, or even a neutral one. It’s shaken me. I feel less safe now than I have in a long time.

I just needed to tell someone. If anyone’s been through something like this, I’d appreciate hearing it.",TwoXChromosomes,5028,1754294325.0,418,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mh7fpl/i_got_into_a_strangers_car_i_feel_ashamed_unsafe/
Yesterday a bigot confused me for a trans woman,"I want to start this off as I respect and see all of my trans women out there as fully women, hard stop. 
This is just me emotionally dumping something that happened yesterday that hurt me.
**Edit:I opened the post this way because I wrote negative trans hate words in this post that were used to refer to me and I wanted to make it clear that those aren't my feelings but the feelings of a lunatic who harassed me. 


Yesterday was my day off and I had to go into work for an hour to get no showed by an interviewee. I figured since I was out and wanted to feel productive I would get my grocery shopping done while I was out. 


I got to the store, sat in my car for a bit and noticed a woman standing next to the cart corral. She looked normal enough and looked like she was talking on the phone via an ear bud. Didn't think much of it, got out of my car and she grinned ear to ear at me so I gave smile back and she let out to her friend on the phone, ""oh my God it's one of those T-slur"" 
I was taken aback still not even thinking she was talking about me, went into the store to get my shopping done. 
This woman followed me around the store at just enough distance that I assumed she was just shopping. She had a cart and everything. Every so often I would hear her say, ""ya you know that their a T-slur cause I'm on the hill"" ""fucking gross ass T-slur I know you're a fucking man"" 


She followed me around the whole store stopping just far enough away to have plausible deniably that she wasn't talking about me until we ended up in the same aisle facing each other, she pointed at me laughed and said, ""I know you're a fucking T-slur""
I know I should have spoken up, I should have just left but I was so taken aback that I felt frozen. 
I got to the check out and was so thankful someone quickly got in line behind me. She circled around like a vulture. I walked outside and saw some charity workers. I stopped to talk to them hoping she would leave me alone. 30 minutes of talking to the charity workers she finally left, I made a donation and went to my car. She didn't even buy anything. Does she just go to grocery stores to harass people. 
I got on my car and cried. 
This woman, a complete stranger decided that because I am taller than average and built broadly that I was a man. She decided to spit hate at me, she found a huge insecurity of mine just from her bigotry of thinking I'm trans. 
I'm still hurt and feel like I shouldn't feel hurt as this is not even a drop in the bucket that trans women actually go through. 
I don't know what I want from posting here, just to scream into the void that I really dislike humanity sometimes. 
And fuck that lady. ",TwoXChromosomes,7474,1727404502.0,577,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1fqdog6/yesterday_a_bigot_confused_me_for_a_trans_woman/
"I'm being ""transvestigated"" and it sucks","Let me just start my little rant by saying that I'm aware that everything I'm experiencing is 100% worse and more unsafe for actual trans women. It still sucks though. 

For the last year, I've been ""transvestigated"" by a number of people. I'm an AFAB femme ... person (?) and I'm currently reevaluating what my gender identity feels like and means to me, so it feels extra sucky. Like I don't even have the space to figure this shit out for myself.  

I'm pretty short, pretty curvy, and ridiculously soft looking. Like, I have a medical condition that straight up looks like someone manually softened my features in photoshop, and that same condition makes it hard to gain muscle. 

There's at least two established friend groups/campaigns at my college dedicated to my perceived transness, and the reach of that rumor on campus is *vast*. Pretty mcuh everyone I meet for the first time that's already aware of me has heard about it, and wholeheartedly believes it to be true. It's gone so far as to reach the school's medical services, who changed my gender markers based on what they heard. Thanks guys, totally professional. My partner works in the community, and the rumor has even made it to people he works with. (I have a pretty visible job, and there's a lot of overlap in community politics and our school community so it's not surprising, just obnoxious.)

But it's not just weirdos on campus. I've been followed into bathrooms. I've been harrassed on the street. Some dude followed me through the grocery store a few weeks ago, preaching to me about my transness. Because the campus system 'talks' to other medical systems, I have to talk to every. new. doctor. I see about it. Last night some woman called me ""sir"" when I held the door for her, and when I politely said ""oh, of course, but it's miss"" she came back into the story to argue about with me about it. (Fuck you lady, I don't want to even be called ""miss,"" but there's no gender neutral equivalent I know of.) I was in a fucking sundress. 

I'm just so tired of this crap. 

EDIT: holy shit, this blew up. I really appreciate all the support and advice. I'm gonna respond to some common questions/comments up here since there's there's a lot of comments and I fell asleep so I didn't monitor them very well. I'm gonna be kind of scant with detail bc I'm honestly afraid of certain people finding this post. 


some general context: I'm in the US (Montana), and I go to a fairly small school. I'm somewhat well-known on campus because I used to work multiple public facing jobs; harassment campaigns, including this one, are why I no longer do them. 

The gender identifiers that were changed in my medical records are supposed to be self-reported, and I'm unsure if they can even be accessed by medical staff or if they have a log of changes. It's possible that my account was hacked, but I haven't noticed any other changes. 

I haven't reported my harassment because I'm honestly not sure I'll be believed or taken seriously. I've faced harassment campaigns before, from some of the same people; when I tried to take action previously, I was told by school administration that they can't do shit without a paper trail, and that life is full of he-said-she-said stuff, so I'm not optimistic. I have no proof other than word of mouth, and the handful of people I know for sure are involved are very good at the metaphorical ""I'm not touching you"" aspect of bullying. As far as the administration is concerned, what's happening to me isn't very nice, but it's neither a serious concern nor a conduct issue. 

The people I know to be involved include are mainly a guy I rejected three years ago and his friends. They have been publicly called out for other types of harassment against other students by our student government, but denied knowing each other. I know this to be false, as my partner used to be in an unregistered club with them. 

I cannot seek help from the school newspaper, as unfortunately some of the staff is involved in spreading rumors. This also cannot be proven with a paper trail and is purely word of mouth.

Best response to All Men/Not All Men debate,"I heard this response from a man, discussing why women say All Men.

He said,

""You've been around guns, right? What's the first thing they teach you about guns? Always assume they are loaded, even if you know it's not. You cannot tell if a gun is loaded just by looking at it.

It's the same with women. They cannot tell if a man is going to explode on her just by looking at him, so she must treat every man as if he is.""

Definitely my favorite way to respond to the NOT ALL MEN response.

Edit: To clarify, I do not agree that all men are rapists, murderers, etc. I do believe women have the right to take precautions and protect themselves from the potential of something going wrong.

People are saying this can be used to give racists the green light, I say anything can be manipulated into a racist analogy, but racists never paid attention to red lights anyway.

FOR ME, I say

If you (M or F) were in a bad part of town alone and you saw guys walking your way, MOST LIKELY you would take precautions like moved to other side of the street, use your phone to let someone know where you are, etc. With some men, if women use precautions on a date, they are harassed and called paranoid or hysterical.

It is for those men that this is a response. The men that trivialize the fear and precautions women live with daily.",TwoXChromosomes,1521,1767979403.0,284,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1q8edd5/best_response_to_all_mennot_all_men_debate/
“Women live life on easy mode”,"Every time I hear some dude whine about how “women have it so easy”, because we get “free drinks” or “attention” or “sympathy”, I want to scream. Like, what planet are you living on, my guy? You think being harassed by randoms since puberty, being afraid to walk alone at night, being talked over in meetings, judged for aging, having our health issues ignored by doctors, and being paid less for the same work is easy?

You think fighting tooth and nail to be taken seriously in male-dominated fields, being shamed for not having kids or for having too many, and constantly being sexualized by media and society is some kind of cheat code?

You think it’s easy when your safety, autonomy, and bodily rights are still up for debate in 2025?

Meanwhile, men can coast through half of life with zero pressure to look young, marry early, or even communicate their emotions like adults. You don’t get blamed for being assaulted. You’re not expected to “keep the peace” at your own expense. You don’t lose career momentum because of pregnancy, childcare, or being deemed “too emotional.”

The truth is: society is set up to benefit men by default. And the ones crying “easy mode” usually haven’t even tried playing life outside their gendered privilege sandbox.",TwoXChromosomes,2972,1752128023.0,339,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1lw5gac/women_live_life_on_easy_mode/
I had a miscarriage on Wednesday. A pharmacist in MO refused to fill my medication.,"This week has been the hardest week of my life and I am not one to want to share these things, but I believe too many people are ignorant about what going through a miscarriage is actually like (including myself before this week).

My husband and I have been trying for a baby for almost a year. I had made so many life style changes, started reading baby books, was taking my prenatal vitamins, and already seeing a physician about possible fertility issue just in case. Finally, on June 4th, I had a positive pregnancy test. My husband and I both cried, it was probably the best day of our lives.

We were overzealous and though we knew miscarriage was an option, you can't convince yourself it will happen to you. We started preparing immediately, buying baby stuff, making lists, and I had a dr's appointment and my first ultrasound scheduled within days.

On Wednesday, my baby was supposed to be 9 weeks and 3 days. We went to the ultrasound and there my baby was. It was there and everything I wanted. Even though I could see it, and it seemed so perfect, I felt in my gut something was wrong because the ultrasound tech was quiet. The silence was deafening and I was convincing myself she was quiet because she wasn't the Dr and wasn't allowed to talk about it. After what felt like 10-15 minutes of pictures, she pulled the ultrasound back to my baby and zoomed back in. She started talking finally. ""And there's your baby, there's the yolk, and the sac... I am so sorry but there is no heartbeat.""

She just sat there, with my baby on the screen, the probe still in my vagina, as I cried and all my husband could do is grab my leg. Eventually she pulled it out and told me she would be back with a Dr. We sat in there for twenty minutes, crying. I spiraled through all the emotions possible grief, anger, fear, guilt, and denial. I almost convinced myself that once the Dr saw the pictures he would know the baby was fine, and the technician was wrong.

The Dr came in and confirmed the baby was not viable. They are able to tell in two ways, one by some measurement (I cannot remember what it was) and by not having a heartbeat. My baby was not viable for both reasons.

The Dr talked with us for a long time and was very kind, but it was so confusing and hard. Miscarriage is confusing and not enough people talk about it. He told me I had a few options: 1) wait to see if my body miscarries by itself. I was not showing signs of miscarriage, and my baby was still there. He said this could take weeks and if the process begins it can take weeks. He said if I do this, I need to monitor for heavy bleeding, extreme pain/cramping, fevers, shortness of breath, and chills. I asked, well isn't miscarrying going to produce heavy bleeding and extreme cramping? His answer was yes. Then how do I know if I need to go to the emergency room? He said well go if you think you need to. If my body did not miscarry itself, I could get sick from sepsis and would put myself at risk and possibly need more emergent care. 2) Take a medical intervention (misoprostol). This will cause the miscarriage and most of it will be done between 24 and 48 hours. 3) Do a D&amp;C, a surgical procedure to remove all the tissue.

The Dr. scheduled me an appointment for the very next day to figure out what we wanted to do. The next day I was with a new Dr to me, but a Dr they specifically chosen because she had dealt with this with patients before and she told me she has went through it herself. Wednesday night, I had extremely cramping and heavy bleeding. I believed this was likely my miscarriage, and it had happened naturally. I told the Dr what had happened, and again realized I knew nothing about miscarriages. She said it could have been. It could have been some of it, could have been none of it. She said I still had the option to wait it out naturally, but again this could lead to it's own risks. We talked through all the options again, and my husband and I agreed the misoprostol was the best option. This way we would know it was done and wouldn't have to live in fear waiting. And to be honest, I couldn't live with knowing my dead baby was inside me any longer.

These are abortion pills. These are what you take when you need an abortion. Let me tell you why I fucking know first hand why no one uses this shit was birth control. I was so scared to take these pills. ""Expect extreme cramping and bleeding, but also go to the emergency room if you have extreme cramping and bleeding."" It was all so confusing. ""Be warry of fevers, chills, shortness of breath, dizziness."" Expect extreme pain, but just rotate between over the counter Tylenol and ibuprofen. Know this could go on for up to 48 hours. Stay home.

And at the end she said ""When you go to the pharmacy, they are going to ask if you are pregnant. If you say yes, they will not give them to you. Tell them instead you are having an active miscarriage"".

Our hell wasn't over. Now we get to go to a Walgreens pharmacy and have to be asked an intrusive question and answer it in front of everyone. You ever been to a Walgreen's pharmacy???????? There is no fucking privacy.  I already had a pit in my gut, I am in Missouri, I was ready for the judgement.

I went to the Walgreen's pharmacy attached to the medical center I was at. I thought it would be safe and they would be the most understanding. And they were... but they did haven't the prescription. She told me she could order it for tomorrow (Friday). My husband had to leave for work on Saturday and I didn't want to be going through this alone, so I told her I needed it today. She told me to try another Walgreens.

We went to the next Walgreens. I asked the technician to check if they had it before they filled it, because I needed it today. She checked and said it was available and they would get it filled. I felt some relief and was ready to get this one nightmare over with and start the next. Then she came out, and she said she was so sorry but the pharmacist refused to fill it.

The pharmacist refused to fill it. It hadn't clicked in my head what was going on, I asked why, she said he said the ""dose was too high"". I gave them my medical paper work (I was not thinking, I just was panicked and wanted this over with). She gave it back to him and came back and just said he refused to fill it. That's it. I asked what I can do, what I need to do. She said she didn't know, there was nothing.

To be honest, I cursed and I cried. I am embarrassed but have I not fucking been through enough? have I not fucking suffered enough? My husband and I went back to the car and we called the original pharmacy, I was crying and yelling and they were so nice. They worked to figure out what they could do for me, and they ended up being able to fill it by giving me a shit ton of lower dosage pills. Thank you to those brilliant angels that went out of their way because they realized how much I needed just some fucking human decency.

I bled a lot on the pills. I cramped a lot and it hurt. I cried a lot and I miss my baby.

And then Friday I was told Roe vs Wade was gone. And I have heard so many people over and over again say this won't hurt women who are having miscarriages and how we are overreacting.

I can tell you right now, the day before it was even gone, that I was denied my medication I needed for my miscarriage. I was denied it in Missouri by a male pharmacist. Right now, it hurts too much, but I am going to call and get his name and file a formal complaint, but this will not end. This will get worse.

I am so scared to have a baby now. This process hurt so much and was so evil and such a fucking nightmare. And now it will be worse. I am so scared of how I will be treated if this happens again. We don't deserve this, no one deserves this.

I was always pro-choice because it's none of my damn business what other women do with their bodies. But I wanted to share my story, because so many people keeping fucking spouting how this won't affect women who have miscarriages.

FUCK YOU to every single one of those people.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I want to say thank you for everyone's kindness. After this situation and then all the Roe vs Wade discussion right afterwards, I was feeling very negative, helpless, and alone. This has made me feel much stronger, more hopeful, and now angry.

My details for the complaint and others to avoid this Walgreens

Address:  330 SW Ward Rd, Lee's Summit, MO 64081

Time: June 23, 2022 at \~4:10 PM

There was only one pharmacist on staff at this time from my knowledge. With these details, Walgreens will know who the person was and I will not have to share a name.

The entire situation:

\- Called them on our way to their location at 3:58 PM, the technician that answered kept getting our last name spelt wrong and would not answer if they could fill it today.

\- Arrive there around 6-8 minutes later, gave details to technician at the counter and asked if she could see if they could fill it today.

\- Technician checked and said yes it was available and went to process the medication.

\- We waited at the chairs in the lobby. The technician came out and said the pharmacist refused to fill the medication, the dosage was too high. I asked what we could do, she said he called our original Walgreens pharmacy (the one that did not have the specific dosage I needed on hand) and they did not answer (WE WILL GET BACK TO THIS). I asked if we could call our physician. She did not respond.

\- THE DOSAGE WAS FOR 600 MICROGRAMS OF MISOPROSTOL EVERY 6 HOURS FOR 24 HOURS. YOU CAN EASILY GOOGLE THIS IS ACTUALLY ON THE LOWER END OF DOSAGES FOR MISCARRIAGE.

\- Gave the technician my paperwork to give to the pharmacist (I should not have done this, but was panicked and did not know what to do)

\- She took it back to him, came back and just said he would not fill it.

\- Asked what I can do? Can I call my physician? What if I call the other pharmacy?

\- She did not respond or give any advice.

\- The pharmacist NEVER CAME TO SPEAK TO ME. Never.

\- I cried and cursed. Sorry to the technician, but no one would help me or give me any information.

\- Left and went to my car. Immediately called the original Walgreens pharmacy. They answered immediately and said they never received a call.

We are in the same team, so we ended up sharing an office and we've spent a lot of time together, supported each other etc. Already from the get go, I didn't know how to handle him. He's very outgoing, extroverted, funny and intimate in his ways. He will touch your arm when he is talking to you, give you compliments and call you señorita or habibti. He will hold up doors and pull out chairs and make grand gestures around it. He is like a parody of a Don Juan, and at the beginning I thought it was all an act because who acts like that for real? At a workplace? Then I started to brush it off as a culture clash thing that I'm just not used to, since he's from another country. I just laughed and shook my head when it became too much, because I couldn't take it seriously. 

But then things have escalated. He confided in me that his marriage is off the rails and they have three kids under 6. His wife and him are not talking at all. He told me I was his only friend, the only one who understands him. Ugh dude, I had known him for a week! It put me in a strange position. 

The other thing that happened that made things escalate, was when I was holding up an elevator door for him and jokingly said ""ladies first"" to which he entered and then realised what I've said. I got into the elevator too and we laughed about it and then he put his hand around my neck, pulled me in, and gave me a kiss on the forehead. There was no time to react, I still had a grin stuck on my face from before and it was over in one second. After that he proceeded to get more intimate, rubbing my shoulders, pulling me in for hugs and not letting go, stuff like that. I sat down to talk with him and told him it's too much and he's acting unprofessional and he can't touch me like that. I thought I reached him. 

I haven't seen him for two weeks since we've been off doing an introduction course, but now we have reunited for a conference out of town with 6 other co workers. Yesterday evening, he invited me up his room and I was trying to get out of it, but I felt like I couldn't. He put on the tv and lied down on the bed and I made sure to stay on the couch. He asked me twice to lie next to him, I refused. Then he got up and picked me up from the sofa so my feet weren't touching the ground and squeezed me tight. Started swirling me around like we were dancing. I told him to put me down and that I was going to bed. When I went for the door, he walked up to me, held me tight and whispered into my ear ""stay a little"". I managed to get free. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. 

Now I'm lying in the dark, panicking. We are stuck here for three more days. I don't know my other co workers that well, there's no one I can talk to. And after these three days, I'm gonna spend 3 hours next to him on a train back home and then we are back to office on Monday. I don't know what to do. 


 EDIT:

I went to work and the post blew up during the day. I'm sorry I can't read all comments now, but thank you to all who have reached out and supported me, especially to those who have reached out to me with stories of their own, with care for my safety and wellbeing. You helped me realise that this is indeed sexual harassment, nothing else. You are all so brave and I appreciate your wish to help a stranger in need. To those who have written to me to tell me how valuable kindness is - an extra thank you. It meant a lot to hear. Being kind is in my nature, and I don't want a douchebag to take that away from me. But I will 100 % work on being less accommodating, and that is probably a more accurate word to describe my actions in this situation than kindness. 

I can see that my post has annoyed some people. Some comments have been harsh, even to the point of victim blaming, but your message has come across: I need to work on being more firm with my boundaries and build my own self respect. I should have done more sooner, I am self critical of that, but I need to focus on what lies ahead. After all, we are gonna work closely together for years to come. Something else worth mentioning is that I only have a probationary employment so far. I don't want this mess, keeping this job is essential. 

There are a couple of things people have asked that I want to address:

Why did I go to his room? There are a few explanations:
1. He is my office roomie back home. I've spent many hours alone with him and somewhere I was hoping that he'd still respect me as a colleague and that going to his hotel room wouldn't mean entering the lion's cave. 
2. I had already spent the entire afternoon with him yesterday, including the 3 hour train ride, and he had behaved completely normal. He acted the same way when we were alone in the lobby. Plus we had just been away from each other for two weeks during the course and it felt good then.
3. I had just arrived at the lobby to hang out with the co workers, and a minute after I got there, they all said goodnight and went to their rooms. Only me and him were left behind and it was a little awkward.  He asked me: “What do we do now…? I can show you my room?”
“No… I think I'm just gonna…”
“What are you talking about, you just got here! What else were you going to do?” to which I didn't know what to respond. As a friend put it, it's hard to say no to a person who only wants to hear a yes. I didn't feel like I had an option. But I was cautious given the history and the change of setting. I was gonna make sure to put a lot of space between us and leave if he tried anything. And I stuck with my plan. And I'm proud of myself for that.


So how did today go?
It's been a rather anxious day and I've tried my best to avoid him. I think he is aware that he has messed up because he has given me space and hasn't attempted to approach me. I have made sure to not be alone with him and my main focus now is to get through the week and get home safe. If he touches me again, I will tell him firmly never to do it again or I will take matters further. I've confided in a colleague back home too. Thanks again for your support.

The art of throwing a tantrum instead of doing household chores and the audacity to think that women dream of living with a man they have to parent,"I don't know what it is about some men who think ""I'm such a catch! All I have to do is exist and be nice when things are good between us and she'll love me forever"". 

The idea of both of us working full time, splitting bills yet me having to do 80% of the household chores the other 20% being him just doing the dishes after I cook (and just recently after living together for 18 months that he does the dishes in a timely manner without me having to ask) doesn't seem appealing at all to me. 

I explained to him I cleaned the shower last week, when it was his month to do it, with hot water. He proceeded to say: you don't pour hot water in the shower. And I said ummm I used hot water from the shower? And he was like ""oh well I thought you meant boiling"". And I said ""Did I say boiling? No I did not"" and we went back and forth for a bit and ooh here we go, figthing over something that he chose to not understand instead of saying ""I'm sorry I didn't clean it, I'll do it this week"" or something like that. He gets so irritated when I get angry at him. He doesn't allow me to me angry because he thinks he's perfect and how dare I call him out on something. 

I said: if you're not happy with how I clean it, DO IT YOURSELF. The audacity to come and correct me on something when it was you that was meant to do it. He said: I'm just teaching you, you don't pour boiling water in the shower. And I said: you're teaching me on something I didn't do?! I didn't put boiling water dude so what are you teaching me on?!

 And then he goes about how I'm being condescending by saying that hot and boiling are not the same. 

This happens a l l t h e t i m e I bring up something. He manages to find a word I say to argue about that and, surprise surprise, we're no longer talking about the issue I initially brought up. I'm also not a native English speaker despite speaking it very well, which sometimes leads me to think he's also nagging me for my speech. Which doesn't impact me because I know I speak well, he's just being obtuse. 

Something just changed in me because I realized I do not want to spend the rest of my life being nitpicked over small words and then yelled at for asking him to do his chores. We've been living together for 2 years, I've made a chores list 5 months ago because this almost 30yo man couldn't look around and see what needs to be done, and even with the chores list, he ""forgets"" to do it. Or, is too tired to do, or doesn't have time to do it. 

He slams the counter and yells ""I've had a shit day, I want to relax and not be told what to do""

I just roll my eyes and say ""oh here we go, another tantrum to avoid being an adult"". This is what he does. Every time I've tried to ask him to do chores, he throws a tantrum. The chores never get done. I can count on *one hand* how many times he has vacuumed in 2 years of living together. 

He games over 20 hours per week and denies it. He gets angry when I tell him to game less and spend more time with me or do the chores. He says ""that's just how he is and that maybe we're just not compatible"". Like ok hunny, good luck finding a compatible woman who will want to date a man child like you. Go off. 

  
I've simply had enough, I've come to realise what am I even getting from this relationship besides a few good moments when things are good between us? I never get taken on dates, he claims he doesn't have money to buy me flowers but spends over 200 on cigarettes every month. Can't even set aside a little bit of money to get me a fucking rose. The only good times we have is when ""things are good between us"". When they're not, he will go 2-3 days without talking to me and ignoring my existence, and I do the same because when I've tried to reach out in the past, he just stone walls me. He has never, not once in almost 3 years, be the first to come and talk and apologize. I used to do it because I'd get scared of us not talking, but now? I feel at peace. He uses his absence as a punishment and now I see him as someone who is so pathetic to think he's such a catch that I'm gonna waste my precious time begging for his attention. 

A few weekends ago, he went on a friends' trip, and I swear it was the best weekend I had in a long time. I got to spend time alone, enjoy the beach, get a massage, see friends and just feel peace that there wasn't someone in the other room yelling at their computer or avoiding wiping the sticky oven top like the plague. 

I have started to imagine what it would be like to live alone and crave it. He still thinks he's a catch though. He still thinks that he's the prize. Just last night, before the argument, we ordered pizza and after the argument he was going on about how he's gonna leave me to eat alone. He said: ""fine then, I'll just leave the house, get fucked, eat by yourself. Every time we argue he's like ""fine then, we should break up"" ""fine then, I'm gonna break our lease and move out"". I used to get so anxious and scared of losing him and now I'm just like ""my GOD, please, do go!!!"". I don't understand what these men think they are the prize for existing and that just around the corner the perfect woman will appear. We want peace and stability, not someone who's gonna avoid issues and then give you the cold shoulder for daring to bring an issue up. It's laughable that they think they're winning. You're doing nothing but actually pushing me so away that the idea of being with you makes my stomach turn.

I can’t use DoorDash anymore.,"2nd UPDATE:
DoorDash has informed me that the person who owned that account has been banned from the platform. 

UPDATE:
I didn’t expect this outpouring of responses, but I’m even more horrified to learn that my experience with delivery services isn’t a unique one. I’m frustrated by the lengths that we have to go to in order to keep ourselves safe that were suggested here (using a masculine name, keeping men’s clothes in my apartment, etc). 

I contacted DoorDash last night after this happened. Since then, I’ve emailed with someone from community response team, who had this response below:

“This sounds like it was a frightening incident and we appreciate you alerting us of this in such detail. This sort of behavior is a violation of our Community Guidelines and something we do not tolerate here at DoorDash. We want to assure you that we have investigated this incident and taken immediate and appropriate action by removing them from receiving any of your future deliveries to ensure the continued safety of our community.” 

I asked for clarification, but it sounds like DoorDash has not removed the account the Dasher was using, only blocked the Dasher’s account from picking up any of my future orders. I’m really disappointed, but not shocked, that more isn’t being done about this issue. 

Most businesses and roads are shut down due to the winter weather, so I will be checking with them tomorrow (if the weather has cleared) for security camera footage of the parking lot.

Original Post:

Ordered DoorDash as a part of my company’s dinner policy tonight. I’ve done this many times and never had a driver have issues parking in the public garage of my apartment lot or get lost. The apartment complex has large, lit signs and clear arrows pointing into the parking lot off of a major road. Both Google and Apple Maps will route you there correctly and the garage is well lit and equipped with cameras. I’ve never felt unsafe meeting someone here. 

My dasher, “Jessica” texted me that she was in the parking lot for businesses next door, to come quickly because it’s cold, and that she had my food ready. I jogged over to the parking lot with my boyfriend and it was pitch dark, except for the car’s headlights being on.

We came around the side of the car and saw there was a man in the driver’s seat, alone, with his pants down. He quickly pulled up his pants in the driver’s seat and threw our order at us before peeling out of the parking lot. 

My name is very clearly feminine on my account. The Dasher also had a very clearly feminine name. I didn’t mention that someone was coming with me to get my food. The Dasher asked me to meet them in a dark, odd place. I keep trying to think of ways that I might have misconstrued this situation in my head, but I think something bad would’ve happened if my boyfriend hadn’t come with me. 

I’ve escalated this to DoorDash and they’re supposed to call me later. I feel sick to my stomach about what could’ve happened and I hope this helps warn other people.",TwoXChromosomes,19251,1675132159.0,880,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/10plndg/i_cant_use_doordash_anymore/
"He flipped on me, left me alone in the woods, and is now trying to apologize.","Long long story as short as I can make it:

We went camping. It has been a long since I could. I was so excited. Had everything packed- even meal prepped food for dinner so it was easy to warm up if we had a few too many. Well.... he did. And it got ugly. 

I fell asleep in my hammock around 3. We had a plan- make dinner at 5, then go get more wood bc we were almost out. When I laid down he said he was going to forage for dead wood.  Great. 

I wake up at 5 and there's this HUUUGE fire he built. All proud with a puffed up chest he's like,  ""see all I gathered?"" I look at the ground and there's nothing. I ask if everything on the fire is what he found and he says yes.  Wtf? I tell him I can't put a grate over that (3 feet high with logs that hang over the side with 12 foot flames) and he LOSES IT. 

Decides to leave, angry.  Only thing I said was ""who does this?!"" as he's busy tearing up the tent to get his shit. He dumps the one cooler he owned onto the ground and straight up LEFT ME THERE.  No car,  no light (he took them out of malicious intent) and my phone was dead on a non electric site. It was getting dark so I had to scurry and get the food I could fit into my cooler before the animals came out. Jar of pickles shattered.  Put the dry food (bread,  chips, etc) into my tent.  Dark came quickly.

I was surrounded until dawn by a dozen raccoons and they weren't playing.  Standing on their back legs,  hissing at me,  lunging for my feet.  I ended up back to a tree fighting those fuckers all night with a stick on fire. There are bears in those woods and that's my biggest phobia. I was terrified. Crying and panicking,  I heard a growl in the woods.  I just stood there frozen,  I was so damn scared ya'll. 

This son of a cunt tried to show up at 7am the next day telling me,  ""if you apologize for the mean way you treated me I'll take you home. ""  BITCH NOW THAT THE DAY BROKE YOU WANNA HELP?! I told that bastard to kick rocks and waited for my mom to come around noon.  I left the site with 2 days paid still on it. Wasnt going to fight those fucks again. And fuck that bear I heard. 

I have completely cut contact with him but he owes me money.  I do have a bunch of his expensive disc golf bullshit that he left here- which he's not getting until he pays me back. Petty or not,  I spent like 600 bucks on everything to do with this trip and he paid zero bc he lost his job. I was just trying to do something nice for him bc I badly wanted to go. Instead I get left in the dark with no communication device, no light, and have to fight off wild animals. No asshole, you can't come sweeping in and fix it. This will never be fixable. 

Sorry for the rant but I didn't know where else to post this.  fuck that dude.


Edit: I've called the police on him and his officer.

I just had the most bone chilling experience in a women's bathroom,"EDIT: thank you sooo much for all the support! It's nice to hear I'm not alone in my experience, but also depressing to see how many of you have had these awful situations happen to you. Thank you for recommending The Gift of Fear, I'll make sure to read it! ❤️

It's the next day, and I can think back to the ordeal. Here's some factors I think could've triggered my suspicion: the doors were very heavy to open, harder to exit. There were no cameras on the outside of the structure. The stop only had three vehicles, all parked and dark inside. Nobody exited afterwards. Regarding it just being someone pooping; I'd totally get that, seeing as I myself am so shy about it that I'd rather hold it in the entire day &amp; wait to get home than to do it in a public bathroom. But the stall was *quiet*, zero sounds. I know I prefer to make some kind of noise if someone else enters the bathrooms, be it a soft cough, sniffling my nose, shuffling my feet, etc. The first sound I heard was when my tap water started – no toilet flushing, no readjusting of clothes, no body movement, just the clank of the metal lock unlocking.

If it was just an innocent bystander; great, no harm done, worst case we spooked each other. If it was someone with ill intentions; I avoided something terrible happening to me.

To those commenting in bad faith: maybe fully read my post next time before commenting, but regardless I sincerely hope nobody close to you winds up in any bad situations if that's how you react to them. I actually can't take your opinions seriously because I know your reaction would be something like ""it's your fault for not being careful enough"" if something *did* happen to me. Always our fault, isn't it?

–

It happened around an hour ago, but I'm still shaken up and I legitimately feel like I've dodged a massive bullet.

It's 12AM in my timezone at the moment, and I'm currently driving home with my partner. We still have two hours to go, but I really had to pee so we stopped at a rest stop. I went into the women's bathroom &amp; IMMEDIATELY got a bad feeling about the place.

It was totally empty and dead silent, the entrance was a heavy door that I had to push open with my body weight, no cameras outside. The sinks were lined up by the entrance, and the three stalls were separated with walls, their doors also quite heavy. My gut was telling me something's wrong so I tried to quietly check if anyone else was in there with me (the doors were floor to ceiling high). The first and the last stalls were open, the middle one was locked. 

That looked door was sending warning signals to my brain, but I *really* had to pee. I slowly creeped past to get to the last stall &amp; there was no TP so I didn't use it. I DID stop and listen if I could hear anyone in the middle stall. There were no noises – no breathing, clothes rustling, feet shuffling, etc. Nothing. I stepped out to reach the first stall, again creeping past the locked door. This stall also had no TP, so again I didn't use it. Before leaving I stopped to wash my hands in the sink closest to the entrance... 

Guys, just when the water turned on I heard that door *unlock*. I fled that bathroom as quickly as physically possible. I jumped into the car &amp; told my partner to lock the car doors, but to wait for a short while because I wanted to see who'll step out after me. Well, nobody stepped out, not even in the following minutes. I looked around the rest stop and the only other signs of life there were a van, a truck, and a camper (all of them parked and dark). Nobody else was there with us, it was dark and empty.

I'm still shaken up over it. It might seem like I'm making a big deal out of this, but I swear on anything that the whole situation was extremely concerning. Usually I'm very preventative about such situations, but because it's so late and I'm tired, my initial warning bells didn't ring loud enough. 

I'm never using non-commercial rest stops again, that's for sure.",TwoXChromosomes,6283,1694387729.0,1056,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16ff1ph/i_just_had_the_most_bone_chilling_experience_in_a/
I hate my boyfriend and I hate feeling this way,"EDIT.

Thanks to everyone who read and commented. I didn't expect so many people to read this; it's terribly long.

A lot of you are being very encouraging and understanding. Thank you for that. 

Many of you are asking why? Why am I even with this asshole? Why have I put up with it for so long? I should know this is all unacceptable, should've dumped him long ago, and so on. 

I think this is something a lot of people deal with when in bad relationships. Things don't necessarily start off bad. In my own case, things started off great. After he moved in, there were annoyances here and there, but at the time I chalked it up to being due to the adjustments having to be made living with a new person. Living with another person is tough. So I thought many of the inconveniences would dissipate over time. 

Things gradually progressed until they became identifiable patterns. My exhaustion grew; my unhappiness increased. Over time, I found myself getting upset and annoyed in his presence. I could feel my blood pressure rise when he walked into the room. 

At first I asked myself what it was I could do to change things. To make them better. I asked myself if I was the problem. 

Things were allowed to get to this point because it's not always obvious what the source of the problem is. 

I typed this all out and posted it because it was therapeutic on some level. I also needed feedback from others to make sure I wasn't crazy. I needed to make sure none of this was normal. (Now I know a few of you will jump on that statement and tell me I should KNOW none of it is normal. It's hard to untangle feelings from logic from memories from manipulation. Having to pick it all apart can be confusing.)

I \*did\* break up with him, after bringing up these issues multiple times. And of course, he claimed he only had good intentions. I was misinterpreting everything. 

As a quick UPDATE to the situation:

I broke up with him a few days ago. Since then, he's been avoiding being home. He only comes home at night to go to sleep. He has not harassed me for sex for the past two nights. He and I had a ""conversation"" last night, at his insistence. Apparently, he is doordashing for extra money (as of yesterday) and believes this is all just a big misunderstanding. A hiccup in our relationship. He also believes that there is ""someone else,"" that I dumped him because I'm interested in another man/talking to another man. This couldn't be further from the truth. I'm not sure if it's getting through to him that I'm unhappy because of our relationship, not because I want to run off with someone else. It seems easier for him to blame some nameless, faceless ""other man,"" rather than take responsibility. 

Again, thank you everyone who has read and commented on this post.

My boyfriend moved into my house a little over a year ago (previously, we had a great relationship). Since then I've grown to absolutely hate him. I feel on edge, stressed out, agitated, ready to retreat, angry, and uncomfortable whenever I see him or when I'm in the same room as him.

I have spent the past few months trying to figure out why. Initially I blamed myself (maybe I've suddenly become a miserable and crotchety person?), but I believe I have a multitude of reasons for feeling the way I feel.

Here, in no particular order, are the reasons I hate my boyfriend:

Reason # 1

Up until only the past month or so, but only after I repeatedly had to lose my everloving shit on him to finally get him to listen and acknowledge my discomfort, he would constantly (4-7x/week for about a year) nag, beg, coerce, guilt and shame me for sex. Every.Single.Night...as soon as I would go to the bedroom at night to go to bed, he would immediately start grabbing and ripping my clothes off, while demanding sex. He would aggressively paw at me in the most unappealing way imaginable. (And the thing is, I love sex. If my body doesn't feel completely destroyed from a long, work-filled day, I usually want to have sex.) And I would recoil because oftentimes the yanking and grabbing and tearing my clothes off was really uncomfortable, and in a few cases, painful. In fact, he pulled something in my back from grabbing me by the shoulders and yanking me around while trying to forcefully take my clothes off. It took months to heal.

So when I would cringe and try to physically distance myself from him (because I would feel overwhelmed and bombarded), he would immediately begin with the nagging. ""Oh, so I guess we're not fucking tonight? Why don't you want to fuck me? Why? Tell me why? Why don't you want to have sex?"" At this point I would be so turned off, I would decide (even if I originally wanted to have sex) that I would prefer to engage in any activity BUT sex with him. So I would tell him ""no, I guess we're not having sex tonight."" Then he'd ask ""why?"" ""Why? Why? Why? Why?"" I would tell him I simply wasn't in the mood (which was true, because I'd lose the desire to have sex after being manhandled and then asked in a weird, almost accusatory, nagging way if we weren't fucking.)

Then more ""why's"" would follow. Then he'd keep going. Nagging. Begging. Telling me if I didn't fuck him, his entire next day would be ruined. He'd tell me he didn't believe I wasn't in the mood, and would demand to know the ""real"" reason why. He'd accuse me of wanting other men. Etc., etc. THIS would happen during the majority of nights out of a week. I would oftentimes just give him what he wanted, just so I could get some peace and quiet. If I didn't give him what he wanted, the nagging and harassing would go on for HOURS. I would look at my phone occasionally. 11pm. 12am. 1am. And every time I would feel devastated, knowing I had to be up early in the morning, and knowing that I would feel like garbage due to being kept up so late, all because he demanded to know WHY I wouldn't have sex with him.

On a few occasions, he would throw temper tantrums and stomp around and tell me he was leaving the house.

What was once a love for sex (on my end; always loved it), became having sex just to get him to leave me alone and let me finally sleep at night.

I've never in my life experienced this sort of behavior surrounding sex, and I've never in my life been so turned off by someone. Over time, I grew to resent him, mainly because he ruined the joy I always found in having sex with a partner, and also because my sleep and restfulness had suddenly taken a nosedive. My days became more exhausting, more unbearable, more tiring (and I'm an extremely busy person, with a mountain of responsibilities; I cannot afford to not get proper rest).

After a few months of this, I had started to feel stressed out before bedtime. I would hesitate to go up to the bedroom to go to sleep, because he would LITERALLY sit next to me on the couch and WAIT for me to begin walking upstairs so that he could run up and follow me and start his bullshit with the demanding and nagging for sex. It became a conundrum for me: I'm exhausted and I need to go to bed, so I want to go to bed, but I also know if I go up to bed, I won't be getting any sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason # 2

When he moved in, I realized that the rent he was paying at his old place was half the amount I pay at my place. And I didn't want to break him financially, so the agreement was for him to pay what comes out to 1/3 of the rent here. And that's perfectly fine by me.

That being said........

Only up until this past month, he has not bought any groceries for the house BUT he eats an insane amount of food. Oftentimes, while he's drunk/drinking, he gets the booze munchies and rips through the cabinets and refrigerator. A lot of times I would come downstairs in the morning, begin making coffee, etc., and find a bunch of empty food containers, packages, bags, boxes, etc. of brand new stuff I had just bought that was meant to last at least for the week (until my next shopping trip), but was now gone.

What's worse is that at no point did he ever think in his head ""wow, I just ate all of (insert food item), maybe I should go to the store and pick some more up so that my partner can have some."" No. Not at all. Never. The first time I brought up my frustration with the matter (in the very beginning), he was like ""oh, you told me I could help myself to whatever I wanted to eat? So what's the problem?""

I was like...""yeah, but I assumed you would help yourself while keeping me in mind. Like I buy this stuff because I also want to eat it. I don't think someone should have to tell you to have some consideration and leave some for me?""

He acted like he had no clue he wasn't supposed to just eat everything all the time and contribute nothing to the weekly groceries or replace anything. Now, whenever I (very politely, mind you) ask him to leave some food for me (usually when I see him drunkenly rip open a package and begin inhaling the items within), he gets defensive, as if I'm being mean. I just want to eat some of the stuff I buy for the house.

Additionally, he doesn't offer to help pay oil, electric, or anything else. I've brought this up - how it doesn't feel like a partnership because he doesn't even ask if I need help paying utilities. He reminded me that the agreement was the amount he's currently paying towards rent (which by the way amounts to $400/month. He's paying $100 a week to live in a house, eat for free, all utilities included).

&amp;#x200B;

Reason # 3

I guess this goes along with Reason # 2, but he always complains that he is broke. He doesn't make enough money. He has no money. He complains about money constantly. So when we go out, I always feel bad, because it seems like he somehow mentions how broke he is conveniently before we go out to dinner or do things together. So I feel almost obligated to pay. I feel guilty making my ""broke"" boyfriend pay for anything. But I know that's on me. That's a decision I'm making.

What pisses me off, is that in spite of how ""broke"" he is (he will often not have the money to pay his part of rent; he'll pay it late, or break it up into multiple payments throughout the month), he buys alcohol every night (with the exception of a random night here and there), go out to drink, AND for a while there, he was getting Amazon packages multiple times per week. He could afford to order a bunch of stuff for himself every week. But he can't ask me if I need help paying the electric bill.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason # 4

He's clingy and....I don't know how to describe it. There's no word to describe reason # 4, but....he's always up my ass. If I get up to move from one room to the next, or if we're sitting next to each other on the couch and I get up to go upstairs, he demands to know where I'm going and what I'm doing and then proceeds to ask ""why, why, why."" He does so in a very accusatory tone. There's this unsettling sound of urgency in his voice. All I'm doing is going upstairs to get something from the bathroom? Like no matter what I do or where I go in the house, he has to know what I'm doing, where I'm going and for what reason. I feel like I can't do anything without giving an explanation and it's exhausting.

I don't typically go out anywhere (besides work and to shop for groceries and household essentials), but the few times I've begun to leave the house (while of course telling him I had to run out really quick), without giving him a full-blown explanation of where I'm going and for what, he's acted like I was going out to...I don't know what....go to an orgy? The one time, I had to run to Target, and he demanded to know for what, wanted to know what was on my list. I was so exhausted from being followed around and harangued, I snapped at him...because who has time to tell someone their entire shopping list?

BUT THEN, he goes out and I don't bother him about it. I don't demand to know details, who, where, why. He actually goes out-out. Like to bars and to hang out with friends. I don't try to stop him. I don't ask him what he's doing. I don't bother him via text while he's out.

I typically use the nights where he's out as an opportunity to go to bed early, and without being harassed. And surprise, surprise...when he comes stumbling through the door late at night, he ALWAYS shakes me awake and demands sex. Sometimes he wakes me up and accuses me of talking to other men while he was away, and it turns into this big thing and I don't get that extra sleep I had so badly needed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are actually some more major reasons, but I'm now realizing how long this post is.

I told him I no longer wanted to be with him. I don't know how that's going to go, because he lives here now, and I know he can't afford to move out. Of course, he's upset. He tells me everything he does comes from a good place. He has good intentions. With the sex, he says it's not as bad as I make it out to be, or that it's not as often as I claim it is. That's not true. I know how often and how bad it's been. Perhaps the fact that he drinks skews his memory? He claims he only asks me a million questions because he's ""trying to start a conversation."" He only follows me around ""because he loves being around me."" In his mind, he's being a saint. And I'm just misunderstanding him.

So of course, I keep going back and forth. Do I dump him? Stay with him? Am I the bad guy?

I've really been thinking about this. I haven't seen him all day, as he seems to be avoiding me and avoiding being at the house (for the last two days.) I feel more calm and peaceful than I have in over a year.

I have to listen to the way I feel around him, which is straight up trash.

Had to leave the park because of a man.,"Yesterday I (27F) took my daughter (4F) to the park and she was playing and then coming back to have a snack or drink or whatever. So we had a backpack with a few of our things spread out on the ground. We were the only ones there which was a little weird, but I figured it was Father’s Day so maybe everyone was home with their dads. 

Some guy walks up (just close enough to be able to talk with voices raised, but not close enough to hear if we spoke normally) and stands over by the little pavilion and asks if I mind if he smokes. I was like, oh that’s kind of considerate, but he’s far enough away so idc. I tell him that’s fine and he starts smoking weed (which is legal and totally fine, but not what I was expecting). 

My daughter asks to swing, so I get up and start pushing her. The dude is like “Happy Father’s Day” which immediately makes me feel off because it’s like he’s acknowledging that I’m a woman here with a kid by myself, but I just say “yeah thanks”

Then he asks if she’s my daughter and I say yes to which he says “oh you’re a YOUNG mom” and I say “not that young, but thanks” as dry as I can manage. Meanwhile thinking in my head that my story will be that my husband is at home having a little time to himself for the holiday. Meanwhile ALSO whispering to my daughter that we need to go. She obviously doesn’t want to and I tell her just a few more pushes and we’ll go. And he’s still shouting questions. 

“Is she your only kid?”

“Yeah”

“Do you want more?”

“Not right now”

“Do you guys like coming here a lot?”

“Sometimes”

“Yeah I used to bring my kids here all the time”

“Cool”

She gets down, I go start gathering our things up and shoving them in our backpack, and she starts talking about wanting to play ninjas. I put on the backpack and my sunglasses and she runs away so I follow her, and he goes “you look real good in those, mom, you’re cute!” And I just kind of grunt, and follow her around the playground trying to communicate to her as clearly and calmly as I can that WE HAVE TO GO. I’m scared to be there, I don’t know if that man is safe, and I don’t want to just grab her and run because then he KNOWS I’m scared. Plus he’s been texting periodically and maybe it’s paranoia, but what if he was texting people that we were there alone?

Daughter finally agrees to go, so I carry her to the car, throw her in through my door, get in, lock the doors, and see him walking toward the parking lot. So now I am FREAKING OUT, buckle her, get the key in the ignition and get the car started right as he walks past my car, and walks TOWARD HIS OWN CAR. I drive away trembling and checking the rear view mirror like crazy. 

But like, what kind of adult drives to a children’s park to smoke weed? Or did he see us, and specifically stop? Plus, WHY do men have to harass us in the first place? I was wearing sweats and a tshirt (not that it matters, they never have the right regardless, but I know I looked plain and dumpy) I just feel fucked up about the whole thing and now I’m nervous to go back to the park in case he shows up, and my daughter loves that park. 

Sorry for all of the word vomit, but I just had to tell someone other than my mom (who is totally 100% on my side btw)",TwoXChromosomes,11904,1655736253.0,1284,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vgn3td/had_to_leave_the_park_because_of_a_man/
This is why many women don't feel safe using rideshare services. After a serious safety incident where my Lyft driver refused to pick me up unless I gave him my personal phone number and email (leaving me alone in a high crime area at night) Lyft ignored me saying I wasn't safe and refused to refund,"I prebooked a driver on Lyft, because I was in an unsafe part of the city, staying with a friend who had to dodge stray bullets while walking the dog at 2pm just two weeks ago. I get my suitcases downstairs, driver is nearby, so I go outside, closing the door behind me. (I don't have a key and my friend is asleep) Suddenly the driver starts texting me repeatedly asking for my personal phone number and email, saying he needs it because there is ""an update"". This is obviously completely wrong, there is no reason for the driver to get this info. A criminal scam at best, a dangerous safety situation at worst since he knows from my picture that I'm a woman.

I refuse. He refuses to come my way and keeps asking. Obviously at this point I have to cancel the ride. $5 charge!!

I contact their safety team to report this. They ask if I'm safe. I say NO, actually I'm not safe. It's night time, I'm standing in a high crime area, alone, and now this creep knows exactly where I am standing, without a ride, having just canceled on him...

They respond with : ""Great, I'm glad you're safe!"" ????

And then refuse to refund me.... Best they can do is unpair me so I won't get this driver again. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.

**Edit: Half a million views on reddit already. Enjoy the bad publicity $5 bought you, Lyft execs!**

Edit 2: The $5 has been refunded with a rather vague, evasive apology that doesn't really take responsibility:

""Thank you for your patience. You were charged a cancellation fee, we apologize for any confusion previously. We understand that you were being asked for personal information, and please know, Lyft will only ever request personal information using:

Phone number: 855-529-5676
SMS text number: 61416

We refunded the $5 cancelation fee. This may take 5-7 business days for your bank to process.

We thank you for contacting us today and for being a valued part of the Lyft community, it was our pleasure assisting you with your cancellation, and if you have any other questions, please reach out.""

Edit 3: Oh hey, they're calling me on the phone now. Lmao. I didn't pick up. I guess 2.5 million views on reddit was enough to finally escalate this.

Edit 4: Holy fuck the official account for Lyft has doxxed me.",TwoXChromosomes,16585,1685972051.0,499,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/141er76/this_is_why_many_women_dont_feel_safe_using/
The time my male friend actually realized how regularly women get harassed just walking down the street.,"This happened a few years ago, but I often feel the need to post this story in various comments, so I'd figure I'd make my own post. 

I used to play in a metal band. I'm the only woman member in that band. We were playing a gig in a seedier side of a city, and I wanted to hit up a liquor store to grab a drink before we played (dry venue.) I asked one of my band mates to walk with me for the 2 blocks to the store. He was a bit annoyed cause it was right there, but agreed cause all he had to do was make a phone call and he could do that at the same time. 

He's walking several paces behind me cause he's on an important phone call. We didn't look like we were walking together. 

Now I will say for shows, I like to dress up a little. Maybe a torn up shirt and thick leggings with boots. 2 guys came walking down the side walk from the other direction, and split so I was in the middle. 

""Hey baby, I like your outfit."" ""Where you going, you look sexy as fuck."" I felt one of their fingers actually reach out and touch my waist through one of the tears in my shirt. 

I kept eyes forward, mouth closed, and kept walking. ""Fine, fuck you, bitch."" As they kept walking the other way. 

My band mate came up next to me (having ended his call.) Convo went like so:

Him: ""hey, you knew those guys, right?""

Me: ""nope. Complete strangers.""

Him: ""what the fuck? Did they actually touch you?""

Me: ""Yup. This happens literally all the time to any woman that walks down the street alone. Why do you think I asked one of you guys to come with me?""

His eyes just widened. It's like something clicked in his brain. Men don't experience or first hand witness this at the same frequency as women. Even though I didn't acknowledge the guys whatsoever, my bandmates first assumption was that I knew them. 

Needless to say, he walked right next to me on the way back.



Edit: Just checked reddit for the first time after posting this, and holy crap! I'm not really sure what to say. It makes me so sad that so many people have the same experience. But, I'm glad that in the modern day of technology, we can support each other. Thank you to the men are allies as well. And to the men PM'ing me calling me sexist or dramatic: You give me the rage fuel I need to continue to speak out, drink gasoline &lt;3

Also, notice how neither this post nor anyone here is saying that all men harass women. No one is claiming that. But every woman has the same experience with a some number of men that is &gt;0. If you take this as a ""you hate all men"" maybe you are projecting.",TwoXChromosomes,27380,1607175385.0,1558,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/k77l9e/the_time_my_male_friend_actually_realized_how/
THINGS EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HER BODY,"I've met alot of women in my life who were unaware about various things about the female body, myself included. As a teenager, there were alot of things I've learned that I thought was true, only to realize it isn't.
I wanted to make a post to share things I've learned over the years, and debunk myths.
This is mostly aimed at teenage girls/young women. But who knows! Maybe you learn something new aswell, even if you don't fit that category.

If you have anything you want to add, feel free to do so in the comments!


**PEE AFTER SEX**
Peeing after sex can help to flush bacteria out of the urethra, and therefore help avoiding an UTI.








**Sex shouldn't hurt your first time**
People make having sex with men as a woman for the first time sound like a complete horror story.
But I'm happy to say, it's not!
It's normal to feel a little sore afterwards, but it's not supposed to be painful.
Don't rush it, have fun with eachother. Make out, touch eachother, etc. 
If it's difficult to insert the penis or if it's painful, leave it be, and do some more foreplay.








**Your vagina is self-cleaning**
Vaginas are self cleaning. You never need to clean the inside of your vagina with water, soap or any other feminine hygiene products. 
The vulva can be cleaned with a gentle unscented soap if this doesn't irritate you, but can contribute to recurrent yeast infections or Bacterial Vaginosis for some people.
Using water alone to clean your vulva is what is recommended by medical professionals.











**Having stains on your clean underwear is normal**
The vagina has a acidic pH level, that's why discharge can leave stains on your underwear. It's completely normal, and that doesn't mean your underwear isn't clean.








**Semen can mess up your vaginas pH-level**
The optimal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which makes it acidic. 
Semen and soap have an alkaline pH, in the 7-9 range.
Because of this, the presence of semen can elevate your vaginal pH long after sex.
If you often have problems with UTIs after having sex, this may be the reason why.
The best way to deal with this is using a condom.

EDIT:
Lubed condoms can actually mess with your pH levels aswell.
Many popular brands of lube/condoms can irritate the vagina due to it's pH level.

- If a product is CE marked, it’s a confirmation that it’s safe for the bodily environment it was intended for, by European Economic Area (EEA) standards. Without this, there’s no confirmation that your lube product doesn’t contain anything that’s harmful to your vulva skin and vaginal pH.
- Avoid lubes/condoms that have flavors/fragrances such as fruity, floral, candy, etc.
- Avoid: Glycerin(e), Propylene Glycol, Nonoxynol 9, Chlorhexedine Gluconate, Petroleum Oils, Polyquaternium-15, Benzocaine, Sugars &amp; Sugar Alcohols, Ureas.

Thank you u/DiabloStorm for informing me about this!
Here's a guide about everything to do with lube, I highly recommed it: http://dangerouslilly.com/lube-guide






**80% of women don't orgasm from penetrative sex**
Can't seem to reach an orgasm during penetrative sex? You're definitely not alone!
The vast majority of women are only able to orgasm from clitorial stimulation, the clit is the only thing on the human body that exists for pleasure only, after all, experiment with it!
Don't accept that sex is done when he reaches an orgasm, when he didn't even try to pleasure you aswell.
Your pleasure is just as important as theirs.






**Most women don't bleed their first time**
In some cultures, a husbands family demands to see bloody sheets after the wedding night, to prove that the bride was a virgin. This is false.
Only 1 in 5 women bleed their first time, I didn't bleed the first time I had sex.
Bleeding or not doesn't prove if the women has or hasn't had sex before.
Quick note: If you're a woman who needs to prove her ""virginity"" by showing bloody sheets on her wedding night, and you're worried that you won't bleed, please DM me. There are multiple ways you can fake bleed, I can help you. Surgery is the worst thing you can do, there are different options that are much better!







**Nobody can look inside your vagina and determine if you've had sex or not**
There have been cases of people taking their girlfriends/daughters/wives to a gynecologist to see if they have stretched their hymen or not.
Like the rapper T.I, who took his 18 year old daughter to a gynecologist to get answers.
The truth is that no doctor or gynecologist can examine you to see if you've had sex or not, that's something only you know.
The hymen can stretch from doing everyday things, running, sports, riding a bike, etc. It has nothing to do with proving if you've had sex or not, it's just impossible to prove that. Some women are born without a hymen.
Please don't be discouraged to do sports and other things to avoid streatching your hymen.
There's help out there for women who need to prove their ""virginity"" to their boyfriend/father/husband this way. No person should ever do that to you. Please DM me if you're in that situation, I will more than gladly help you.
Virginity is a made up concept to make people feel ashamed about their sexual experiences or lack there of. Again,  nobody can determine if you've had sex or not.

EDIT:
Thank you u/Chickiri for posting this great and informative comment:

""While it's not possible to tell wether you're a virgin or not based on the state of your hymen alone, there are ways to detect wether or not you've had sex, which are especially important in the case of rape. If you've been raped/fear you've been raped (if you feel like maybe you've been drugged/intoxicated/any other situation), please seek a professional: this is very important for your health, and for any legal action you might want to take.""

This is very important, it's completely understandable if you're afraid to report it. But please go to the hospital first thing, don't shower or change clothes. They will help tremendously, and they won't force you to report if you don't want to.






**Having large labia minora is normal**
Labiaplasty is getting more and more popular amongst young women, because they feel like their vulva is ""abnormal"".
It isn't, every single vulva is normal. There is not a ""right"" way for a vulva to look. 
There's a woman and activist called mediclit on twitter, she got a labiaplasty at 18. The procedure left her mutilated, and she no longer have any feeling in her clitoris. If you're interested in this topic, I suggest checking her out.
Please be safe!








**It's totally normal for one boob to be bigger than the other**
It's way more common to have asymmetrical boobs than have symmetrical ones. It's actually very rare to have perfectly symmetrical boobs, don't worry about it!
That being said, if you suddenly develop asymmetry, like a sudden increase or decrase in volume of the boobs, you should get that checked out. That’s especially true if that change comes with other symptoms like skin retraction, or thickening, dimpling, or a change in color of your breast. 








**You can get pregnant during your period**
It's very unlikely, but it's not impossible.
Once inside a woman, sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week. Ovulation can occur soon after, or even during, the bleeding phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, giving the sperm the chance to get lucky. 








**The vagina does not become ""loose"" if you have alot of sex**
Ever wondered why men say a woman who've slept with a 100 men have a ""loose"" vagina, but a woman who slept with the same man a 100 times doesn't? Me too!
This is simply a slut-shaming tactic, it isn't true. 
Virginity is a social construct, and who many people you've sex with is nobodys business, and it doesn't determine your worth.
The vagina can push out an entire baby and go back to its normal size, a dick won't change shit.






**Birthcontrol isn't only for avoiding pregnancy**
I had very painful periods as a teenager, had all horrible sideeffects you could think of.
My mom suggested that I tried birthcontrol. Her suggestion made me feel embarrassed, I associated birthcontrol with having sex, and I hadn't had sex before at that age.
She explained that you can go on birthcontrol even if you aren't sexually active, and she's absolutely right.
There's many reasons why a woman would choose to go on birthcontrol, preventing pregnancy is only one of many.






**Penetrative sex isn't the only way to have sex**
This annoys me alot. As a bisexual woman, I've been asked numerous times how two women have sex. They never ask how two men have sex, why? Because a dick is involved.
This is especially irritating considering that only 20% of women are able to orgasm that way.
To clarify, sex isn't just being able to orgasm either. But it annoys me that many men totally ignore the part that makes women reach climax, and won't even consider it sex.
Sex is so much more than just penetration, have fun with it, explore.




**Vaginal discharge 101**
I used Mama Doctor Jones video about discharge to provide pictures to better show what I mean. Thank your everybody who suggested her channel in the comments, very informative, and I highly recommend checking her out, you can find her video [here] (https://youtu.be/KHF8mB_8LUM)

Discharge is a completely normal bodily function that cleans and protects the vagina.
Your vaginal discharge can vary depending on your cycle, and it can vary from person to person.
Some of us have alot, some of us have less, it's completely normal.
I do not recommend wearing pantyliners on a daily basis to prevent getting discharge on your underwear, it can irritate the skin of the vulva. 

**Healthy/Normal discharge**
The color of vaginal discharge more commenly white or off-white, but sometimes it can have a bit of a yellow hue, and sometimes it can have a more transparent look.
[Here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHfQyZ.jpg) are some examples of normal consistencies and colors of discharge.

*In the absence of any other symptoms*, these consistencies are completely normal:

- Watery/Clear

- Gel-like ""stringy"" discharge, normally happends before ovulation.

- Also consistencies that I included in the photo.

Your discharge may be a brownish color, this is also normal, reference photo [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHDEfo.jpg)
This is called spotting.
Spotting is defined as light vaginal bleeding that happens outside of your regular periods.
This kind of brown discharge can often happend at the end of your cycle. It's old blood mixed with discharge, which creates a brown-like color.

**Abnormal discharge**
First of all, it's important to recognise how your discharge usually smell like. It shouldn't smell foul, but it's normal to have a smell or lack of it. If it does have a funny smell, it's a sign that you should get it checked up.

Cottage cheese-like chunks in your vaginal discharge, looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHlZIV.jpg)

This can often signify a yeast infection.
Especially if it's followed by any of these symptoms:

- Genital Itching 

- Swelling

- Redness 

- Burning sensation while peeing or having penetrative sex

- Your discharge might smell a little ""off"" if you have a yeast infection, but it can also have no odor at all.


TREATMENT:
If it's your first time having an yeast infection, or if you're unsure if it is an yeast infection or not, make an appointment to your doctor.

Otherwise, you can buy a over-the-counter yeast treatment. (Not recommended for pregnant women, book an appointment)
If your symptoms persists, book an appointment.

Don't be embarrassed if you have a yeast infection, it's very common but unpleasant. Don't be afraid to seek treatment.

To reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections: 

- Wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.

Avoid:

- Tight-fitting pantyhose

- Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection

- Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons

The following may increase your likelihood of yeast infections:
- Stress

- Diabetes

- Use of birth control pills

- Pregnancy

- Antibiotics, especially prolonged use over 10 days




Alot of yellow discharge that looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHs8JF.jpg) especially if you have other symptoms could indicate chlamydia.
A slight yellow hue can be normal in certain situations. But if you feel other symptoms, or if you recently had sex with a new person, you should get that checked out.
Remember! Some people don't have any symptoms when they have chlamydia. Untreated chlamydia can result in serious health complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.
That's why it's very important to use a condom when having sex, and get tested if you have any doubts.

If you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STDs, seek medical treatment.

Lime green discharge, that kinda looks like mucus in my opinion, reference [here]
(https://pasteboard.co/JZHvzad.jpg)
And [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHvNlq.jpg)
If you have a new sexpartner or in any situation where you can be at risk for STI or STDs, this can indicate gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.

Symptoms of trichomoniasis:
- Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals

-Discomfort with urination

-A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell

Symptoms of gonorrhea:
- an unusual vaginal discharge, which may be thin or watery and green or yellow in colour

- Pain or a burning sensation when peeing

- Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area  (this is less common)

- Bleeding between periods, heavier periods and bleeding after sex (this is less common)

If you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STD, seek medical attention.

If your discharge have a thin, gray color, it can indicate bacterial vaginosis. Couldn't find a good reference photo for this one, sorry about that.

What is bacterial vaginosis?
Bacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of bacteria naturally found in the vagina, which upsets the natural balance.

Symptoms:
- Grey-like discharge

-Discharge have a strong fishy odor

- Burning feeling when you pee

- Itching

50% of women do not have any symptoms.

When to see a doctor:

-You have vaginal discharge that's new and associated with an odor or fever. Your doctor can help determine the cause and identify signs and symptoms.

- You've had vaginal infections before, but the color and consistency of your discharge seems different this time.

- You have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. Sometimes, the signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are similar to those of bacterial vaginosis.

- You try self-treatment for a yeast infection with an over-the-counter treatment and your symptoms persist.






**Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**
TSS is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins.
This can affect both men, women and children.
Risk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons.
Having your tampons in for longer than 8-12 hours can increase the risk of an infection or TSS.

Symptoms:
The symptoms of toxic shock syndrome start suddenly and get worse quickly. They include:

- A high temperature

- Flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, feeling cold, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a sore throat and a cough

- Feeling and being sick

- Diarrhoea

- A widespread sunburn-like rash

- Lips, tongue and the whites of the eyes turning a bright red

- Dizziness or fainting

- Difficulty breathing

- Confusion

TSS is very rare, but these symptoms should absolutely not be ignored, if you experience these symptoms, contact medical emergencies immediately. If you're using a tampon while experiencing these symptoms, remove it straight away. Inform medical staff if have used a tampon while experiencing these symptoms.



Like I said, feel free to add anything if I forgot about something.

I hope you all have an amazing day!

Thank you so much for the awards and positive comments. 
Your comments warms my heart, I'm so glad that many of you have found it helpful.

Seeing that many parents show their daughters and sons my post makes me so incredibly proud of myself, you have no idea how much it means to me.


I'm happy that many women and girls are comfortable  enough to DM me with questions about their body, questions that they're afraid to ask in real life.

"""Excuse me miss, don't feel alarmed, I'm walking behind you to get to my car. I'm going at a bit of a fast pace. Don't worry, I'm walking right past you""","Said the man who walked righr past me, as stated to his car on my brief stay in Minneapolis. I was going to get dinner and I was on the phone with my mom just in case because it is dark out and I was scared. 

Right as I'm about to get inside, he says this to me and it immediately made my night better. Of course I'd like to live in a world where I don't feel threatened and where men don't feel the need to make their intentions known as they walk past me. But knowing that he was aware of the fears many women have and willing to do that for me. It just made my night. 

I'm getting surgery tomorrow, and have been all rattled up, so, I genuinely feel a lot more at ease now thanks to this kind stranger.

I think some men in my neighborhood are preying on me and I’m so scared. Advice please.,"I am a 22 year old who graduated from college just last year and moved into my very first place alone. It is a small apartment complex and I’m out walking my dog/running errands all the time, so it’s pretty easy to catch on to my schedule and my lifestyle with just some friendly chatting or observance. 

Two specific men have been actively stalking me (I think?) and my gut is telling me to run/do something. 

The first guy, Eddie, used to hit on me from his balcony or in the parking lot when I first moved in. Being naive I was nice and would chat, but very quickly started shutting conversations down and basically running from him when I realized he would watch from his balcony to see when I got home and then come down to encounter me on the stairs. Once I was carrying groceries inside and he pretty much *blocked* me from getting into the breezeway insisting to help me with my groceries. Being panicky and naive, I let him help me with the groceries into my apartment. I feel like once he realized I live alone, his alarming actions escalated. He noticed I didn’t have any bedroom furniture and told me his daughter had a bedroom set in storage that he would give me for cheap. I gave him my number and told him to send me a picture of it. He never did, and several repeat encounters afterwards he kept inviting me to go to the storage room to check out his daughter’s furniture, that he would even drive me, and I would always remind him to send me the pictures. Once he even pulled up to me in his car and I thought I was going to be kidnapped. Now I literally either pretend I’m on the phone or speed right past him, it feels like a horror movie. 

The other guy, don’t know his name so I’ll call him Shepherd because he has a German shepherd, basically started the same way - hitting on me from his balcony and then coming down to encounter me. Having gone through this, I very quickly brushed him off and ignored him. Just recently he started walking his dog the exact time I leave for work and the exact time I come home. Today he waved me down in the road as I was parking and I tried to wait in my car for him to finish walking his dog so I could get out, and he stood waiting. The other night he was talking to me and saw me walk into my apartment and began to walk his dog alongside me saying it was time for him to head home too - I know he was following me because he doesn’t even live in my building. He was in my breezeway last night before I left for work and then this morning after flagging me down. So now he knows which unit I live in, my car, and that I live alone. 

I am so scared. I bought pepper gel and lock my doors - what the hell else can I do? They’re not doing anything illegal so I can’t call the cops. My gut lurches every time I see these men because their honing in just gets more and more intense. They know my every move. What do I do? 

TL;DR: I think two men are preying on me and I feel defenseless and afraid.",TwoXChromosomes,10222,1630068214.0,1850,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/pcml1l/i_think_some_men_in_my_neighborhood_are_preying/
I feel deeply ashamed and embarrassed after asking strangers for help in an emergency.,"This might be long, but I don't yet feel comfortable talking about it with friends yet, so I'm telling Reddit.

A few days ago I was opening at work. It was early morning, still dark out, the store wasn't open to the public yet and I was completely alone. I took a lozenge as I'm recovering from illness and I started to choke. I tried to throw myself on the back of a chair, but it didn't work. I ran out of the shop into the street and basically began flailing around, doing the choking sign, trying to get anyone's attention. I couldn't breath, speak, or swallow. 

There were just a few people out, and they were looking at me like I was crazy, trying to avoid me (I live in a big city so this was a relatively normal assumption to make I suppose) and I felt so helpless. Finally two people noticed me (a man and a young woman, separately) and I guess realized I was being legit. The man tried to give me the Heimlich and the girl called 911. The man seemed annoyed by me and the girl looked suspicious still and kind of alarmed but I'm grateful for their help.

While he was helping me the piece became dislodged and I could breathe (narrowly) and speak again, but the lozenge was still stuck in my throat and I couldn't swallow it. I was still in a state of panic. The man was telling me ""You're breathing, though"" in a way that felt accussatory, like I shouldn't be panicking anymore, and that's when I started to feel extremely embarrassed. 

I felt so guilty for bothering them and for making a scene. I immediately started apologizing and getting insecure of how I must have looked in the moment. I still am.

The EMT's arrived after I could breathe again. There were about 8 EMT's there, all male. They checked on me but since I could speak and breathe, I felt they weren't taking me seriously. ""Sometimes people think they're choking when they're not. Don't worry, we get these calls all the time."" Okay, well, I could not breathe for a bit so pardon my assumption. 

I told them it was still stuck in my throat, they look with a light but didn't see anything. They were mostly helping me calm down and gave me water, and it overall just felt invalidating. I think this is why I am embarrassed to tell people this story, because I don't want to be made to feel that my panic was an overreaction. Maybe there is a technical difference between ""choking"" and whatever was happening to me (the piece didn't ""come up,"" but was eventually either dislodged or dissolved enough for me to swallow it with water, which is a distinction they made a point to tell me) but it sure felt like an emergency. 

I just can't shake the feeling of embarrassment at having to get help from strangers and having them see me in such a state. And then I feel shame for feeling embarrassed. 

I'm posting this here because I think it's common for women to feel this way and it sucks. I guess I'm just wanting to get it out and wondering if anyone has experienced something like this, and how to get out of that cycle of guilt.

TL;DR I choked and am now feeling deeply embarrassed from having to ask strangers for help and inconveniencing them. I'm not sure how to shake it. Has this feeling happened to any other women out there?",TwoXChromosomes,1342,1761596396.0,273,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ohpcea/i_feel_deeply_ashamed_and_embarrassed_after/
I was lost in the big city at night without my phone. Ran into a group of men. Turned out better than I hoped.,"So this Saturday i was a long way from home at a festival-like event with my bff and some girls from her university class. It was fun and we danced and got a little too many beers.

Unfortunately on my way home, I got separated from them. Oh well, this happens - let me just call… oh no. My phone is dead. And suddenly I was all alone in a city i didn’t live in with no way to contact anyone at the middle if the night. 

I was SO scared. I began crying and aimlessly walking toward the next bus stop. I had no idea how to get home - only knew if I could get to the main station, then there was a chance. But i didn’t know where i was or how to get there. I got on the first bus and asked if it took me there. It did not - but somewhat close to there. And i just couldn’t stop crying. 

Out of no where - this guy swooped in and asked me if i was ok. He heard me crying and was so concerned about me. And me being scared and drunk i told him my issue and what city I lived in. He gathered his guys (they were a couple of friends who went out together) and went to tell me not to worry and promised they would get me home safe. 

They tried to cheer me up and asked me about life and school. Introduced themselves and asked if I had anyone I would like to call. Offered me their phones. I called my mom and bf - and neither picked up - so they wrote them a text explaining the situation. And that they were helping me get home and not to worry. 


We all finally got on the train together headed for the city i live in (two of them were headed the same way) and helped me check in and even offered to pay for my way home if necessary.

We finally got to my city and they smiled - asked if could find my way back home (i could) - and then said goodbye and left. They wanted nothing from me but knowing i was safe. 

I have been so moved by this experience. A group of guys in their thirties taking their time to help a dumb little 21 year old me get home safe. Wanting nothing in return.

In a world so cruel and harsh as ours its been so incredible to know kind people still exist. I don not believe I will ever forget them. I just wish i could show them how grateful i am for their help.

So thats it. I just wanted to share some positive with you all.",TwoXChromosomes,23712,1653299040.0,590,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/uvwimj/i_was_lost_in_the_big_city_at_night_without_my/
Egypt is a hellhole and no one cares,"First of all, i am literally typing in tears , i feel so helpless and insignificant, i feel like i am fighting a losing fight Everytime i speak


And i am not even the targeted minority here, we have legit 99.99% of rape and harrasement victims of the entire female population, 


We have such a toxic culture , where if you got raped your social life is over and you should kill yourself ""sheikhs have said that"" and that the only way out of it is marrying the bloody rapist , so girls just never tell


But in private and in a safe space everyone has over a shit ton of stories, girls get raped no matter what age or what they were , then some sheikhs come and say ""they provoked it on themselves by wearing those clothes"" 


Then u ask what clothes are ok, they go anything other than a hot short, some other will go, no anything other than hijab is wrong and worthy of rape, and some go no no it's either niqab or rape, and some go, that women getting out of their houses is enough to provoke men


They are literally  excusing actual rape, and some young sheikh with 2 million followers was asked ""what about women who wear niqab yet get raped?"" He replied "" it's because men saw earlier women wearing provocative clothing, so the pent up pressure is forced upon them""


WHAT, I don't mind horrible and dumb thinking , but not when it has this influence and has no logic or proof or sense or anything


Imagine having Christian friends in this community, if i walk with a girl in the street we get harrased together and commented on, and people walk up to is saying dumb and offensive stuff like ""get out of here we don't want sluts like you here"" ""hey prostitute come to me after him please""


And the worst part is, i am a coward, I can't stand up though i know i am right, i can't defend or help anyone because i know if i even try to do anything they will harm both me and her horribly, and it will be without purpose


I open social media to find 80% of people supporting rape culture , actual rape, because who wouldn't when you have the power, every female friend I've gotten close to has told me a story of messed up sexual harrasement, and many of them have shared suicidal thoughts 


Any woman who tries to say anything is branded an ""atheist"" and a dumb ""feminist"", if a woman walks alone , no matter what she is wearing has the chance of 99.99% of getting raped or harrased, and he can't tell anyone or defend herself or either she is a dumb atheist feminist and how dare she think she has the same rights as men to walk in the street


And why would i come whine here, is it karma whoring, or virtue signaling


No, the issue is that people that share my thoughts here are people who are already rich enough to live in upper class and have enough influence and money to stop it, never face people like this, so we have not much of any activism


I have no platform, money, followers, looks, smarts, anything


I always came to reddit to find relatable people and ignore the hell hole i live in, but it's becoming harder everyday, and i am scared and weak, I don't even know what i want


If anyone can do anything, wether awareness, support or any form of help 


Please do, i hate being a weakling but that is who i am, i hope i can reach out to someone or people that can help, save me, save us


(edit:many people have this misconception , but i am a male, and i don't promote the idea of just travelling to a safe space, though logical and should be done,the idea of giving up on my country and leaving my friends and family behind to rot is holding me back , and stop blaming islam corrupt people will use whatever people are following and twist it)
 
Going even deeper, women aren't encouraged to find a job or travel or study much, as much as they are told ""when you marry a man, you'll be free to do as you please"", newsflash ,nope

There was a story of 2 women surrounded by 200 rapists, they sat in a store and called for help, and out was standing the rapists trying to get in, the  store owner had to kick them out because they might cause his property damage, from start to finish it is recorded and it is horrifying,and media said ""it's up for debate, did you see what they wore"", literally they had to get 4 male friends fighting a crowd of gropers who laughed as they pulled them from clothes and hair as they were crying

Women get called horrible shit and bullied online, people ""sliding""into the dms with entitlement, that if women don't respond , they steal pictures and threaten them with photoshoping them on nude bodies and ruin their lives and share them, while sending horrendous comments and pictures, and that is not extreme cases it also is a the norm

People who grope in public, harras online, black mail , are considered ""cool"" people ""living the life""

People of our community are discouraged to travel and leave the country, it's considered unpatriotic, and they always go ""look at their politicial issues, the even accept gays, they are no better than us if not worse, stay in a muslim country"" ,so most people think that this is the same everywhere, so no one seeks change or asylum as much

(People on reddit are twisting my words and using them to push political views, the same issue i am against, i stated facts of what happens, that any research will prove me right, i have said my own personal experience that many in the comments share similar experiences if not worse, if i am being punished for saying what is happening and what i feel about it , then so be it)

But i never advocate they stop taking immigrants, i support it whole heartedly,and it the most reasonable choice for us, and should be accepted by all

I never said i am against islam and said my issue was never with islam, it's with corrupt people in power here who use whatever works to control people, wether comedy, religion,culture,
Plus i am a Christian hence my name, and there are Christian people using Christian faith to support this insanity, so apparently the way i see it, the issie is with culture not religion currently

People will put their fingers in their ears and say i am a puppet, or i am a blind retard who supports islam, or a puppet made to be anti islam, the the whole post is about people like you who twist words to get what they want 

I am not saying arabs are bad, i am saying we still have a long road to go, and i hope we go it , so people DMing or commenting, do some research then come with an argument, not ""he's wrong, cuz I don't want to think about this""


And if you want to do research, there is the story of the 2 girls surrounded by the 200 rapists with videos proof, there is the story of the rapist of over 100 in the auc his name is ahmed something and was only jailed because public outcry but  will be let loose in no time after the fuss is over, just like what happend last time when another controversy happened when a teen killed another teen for defending a hirl from sexual harrasement, while caught in camer, it was glossed over , and you have sheikh abdullah elroshdy , he is one of the famous radical fake sheikhs, who abuses people's lack of knowledge and uses islam as a veil for his extremist thoughts, and he has a huge following

The problem is, no one in Egypt is denying these things happened, the problem is hos they excuse it, do your research if you want, talk to any girl who lives in egypt, males here don't notice it, and won't notice it unless they get  of their own way and they excuse it in their head, i am jot cherry picking, literally ask any girl who lives in Egypt",TwoXChromosomes,29034,1593974977.0,1405,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/hlrv00/egypt_is_a_hellhole_and_no_one_cares/
"Sometimes, you'll protect yourself, and in response, a man will call you a b----.","While I was walking my dog, Moose, after work last night, in the frozen darkness that is December at 6pm in Minnesota, I noticed a van, headlights offs, creeping along parallel to me behind a hedge in a parking lot.

As I walked faster, the van pulled ahead of me and stopped, and I could see two men inside silhouetted against the streetlight beyond.

I started making a wide berth around the back of the van, and immediately, one of the men leaned out of the passenger side door, and said, smiling, ""Hey, I love your dog - what kind is that? He's beautiful! He a boxer? HEY! Lemme see!""

I walked faster and hoped they couldn't see my legs shaking. Last thing I heard was, ""We were only being FRIENDLY, BITCH,"" and the scream of their tires.

And in that moment, I felt a pang of guilt. *For being ""mean"" to those two men.* Seriously. Yet if I **had** been been friendly to those creeps, and they ended up groping or grabbing me, *I would then have felt guilty for putting myself in a situation I knew was dangerous.*

So you know what? Fuck that guilt. Fuck feeling guilty for protecting yourself, and fuck feeling guilty when pieces of shit harass you.

&amp;#x200B;

And the next time someone calls you a b----, tell them to fuck off. For me. =)

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit**: To be clear, there was **no** actual reason for me to feel guilt in that situation. But fighting off nearly two decades of parents, relatives, pastors, and mentors telling me to ""submit"" to men, to be ""modest"" for them and ""gentle"" to them, is a hell of a battle. Bless therapy.

**Edit 2**: u/ Category\_Think just sent me a DM entitled, [""Why would anyone rape you?:""](https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/wv0bh1) with an enclosed message telling me why my body is unrapeable. Though many Redditors are wonderful, some men insist on making it a hellhole.

**Edit 3:** I now have men messaging me **telling me I'm being too hard on the rapey DM guy.**

My experience being a woman of color in the US,"Hi all. Throwaway for privacy.

I have seen a lot of stories come forth about what life is like when you have a little extra melanin. I have a lot of friends that sympathize, but they cannot really fathom what it is like. I wanted to share mine. For reference, I grew up in a middle class area in a liberal state. If this is not the place for this, please let me know. But these are experiences that I have lived. Sorry about the length and thank you for reading. On mobile so formatting.


Age 5: My best friend was a blonde little girl. One day, we were walking out of our kindergarten class together, and her father saw us walking together. He rushed forward and put his arm around her shoulder and ushered her away from me as quickly as he could. Later in the school year, we wanted to hang out after school like little five year old girls do. Her mother called my mother and told her how my mom made her uncomfortable, and she no longer wished to have us be friends.

Age 5 on: Having people be surprised that my mom is white, and be ridiculed for it.

Age 8: Called a n***** and told to get off of someone’s property, I was told that I was allowed to play there.

Age 10: Approached by a basketball coach and forced to play(I had NO talent for basketball).

Age 14: Shopping for dresses with my best friend. As we wondered the store, the same clerk followed us. They try to hide it, they are putting away clothes. We ask my mom why we keep seeing her, and my mom tells us that we are getting the “special treatment”.

Age 15: Shopping for hair supplies at a store aimed at black hair products. The Asian owner followed us the entire time, “straightening up” right next to us. When we tried to leave after buying something, which she saw, before we could leave the store, she accused us of shoplifting. She had literally just watched us buy the item that she observed us select from her special treatment.

Age 17: My now husband and I had just gotten out of school, and we walked down the street to the Rite Aid to get some snacks. The security guard refused to allow me to inter the store with my backpack, and they made us leave it up front at the cashier. The guard proceeded to just happen to be patrolling the store in whatever area we were in.

Age 18: I realized how difficult it is to find a hair stylist, because you can 100% tell when someone is afraid to touch your hair, or how obvious it becomes that they have no idea what they’re doing. But you learn to just pay them and don’t go back.

Age 19: We decided to get married. My husband’s dad told him, “You know she’s black. Your kids will be too.” His uncle told him he couldn’t believe he was marrying a n*****. His dad still treats me like absolute shit to this day. We have gone low contact.

Age 20: Realized that when I’m not being followed while I’m shopping, when I actually want help I get treated like I’m wasting their time. Or it’s hard to even find someone that will talk to me.

Age 20: I was at in class a predominately white university. I was the only black student in the class while we were reviewing Langston Hughes, and I was asked more than anyone to give my thoughts on the experiences he talked about.

Age 21: Attempted to get a job as a 911 dispatcher. I made it all the way to the portion where you have a super long interview about your life with a sheriff. He continually asked me about my “troubled past”(There isn’t one) and he didn’t believe me when I told him that I have NEVER been in trouble for anything. He asked me if I’d ever had sex in the car, or in any public places. To this day I don’t know why that was relevant. I did not get the job.

Age 22: I got hired at my current organization because I’m black and I speak Spanish. How do I know? The manager that hired me told me, “Thank God you speak Spanish, when I saw that you were black and that you’re fluent, that’s all I needed to know!” She proceeded to try to performance manage me out, in an attempt to say “Well, we tried to hire a minority but it just didn’t work out.”

Age 23: I ran into the same dad from my age 5 recount while I was at work one day. He knew I got married because his daughter was my bridesmaid. He proceeded to tell me how he daughter had done things “the right way” by going to school and finishing first before dating/getting into a relationship, and that he was so proud of her, but was sorry that I hadn’t had the same luck.

Age 24: People are surprised at how long and “soft looking” my hair is. I get asked a lot if it’s a weave or if I’ve permed it. A lot of unsolicited touching. Can we take a second and imagine that in reverse? I’ve never had my hands in a white girl’s hair, but imagine if I walked up to a complete stranger, announced that fact, and ran my fingers through her hair. I’d probably get arrested for assault.

Age 25: I was newly pregnant. It was my third pregnancy, but I had no living babies. My previous doctor couldn’t see me, so I had to find a new one. I found an OB that would see me, and my husband came. The doctor spent the entire time(without actually examining me) telling me how this pregnancy was not viable. He would not let me leave without getting a STD test. I told him my husband and I are exclusive and we’d been together for 11 years. “Well, you never know.” He took the sample anyway during my pelvic exam. When he did the ultrasound, he happily proclaimed that he was right, my uterus was empty. He offered to redo it in 2 weeks. When I left, the nurse gave me multiple pamphlets about being a black mom, and over the next several days I got calls from social workers offering free services and items for low income minority mothers. I never asked for that. They didn’t know my income. That same baby from that non-viable pregnancy is a year and a half now.

Age 25: It was a group of us out dress shopping for my best friend’s wedding. We stopped for lunch, and we had to wait for the restaurant to open. We were first waiting at the door, but were not seated first(This restaurant does not take reservations). They proceeded to proceed and wait on 6 other tables, who had ordered and gotten their food, before we were even approached to order our meals.

Age 26: I was pregnant with my daughter and I called into the doctor’s office multiple times with alarming symptoms. My blood pressure was high, and my limbs were so swollen I couldn’t sleep because they were hot and throbbing. My symptoms were dismissed until it was almost too late. Even when I was at the ER with trouble breathing and a pain in my chest, I was almost sent home. I still thank God for the OB that ran to grab me before I got discharged and diagnosed me with pre-ecclampsia. She saved mine and my daughter’s lives.

Age 26: My daughter was in the NICU for 66 days. Any concerns I raised about her care were brushed under the rug. There was a point where I complained to multiple nurses about the mask that they pushed into her face, and they were ignored. She has a scar on her nose now that was 100% preventable.

I want everyone to just imagine for a moment. Imagine that you just got a job. You’re ecstatic. But you walk in on your first day scared out of your mind, because you know you have to prove you’re worthy to be there. There is no one else that looks like you.  Imagine going shopping. Minding your own business when you notice the same person keeps asking you for help. Imagine not knowing if your friend group looks down on you because of how you look. Imagine your health, your feelings, your LIFE not being taken seriously. Imagine being made out to be a criminal before anyone even knows you, and being told “wow, you’re not like other black girls”. Imagine being told “Wow, you’re pretty/intelligent/well-spoken for a black girl.” Imagine being questioned in your own home, or on your way home, simply because you look like someone that committed a crime.

Have you ever been pulled over by a police officer? Were you scared? What did you say? Imagine being pulled out of your car because the officer suspects you to have drugs, but you were on your way to school. You’re forced out of the car, put in cuffs and you’ve got a boot on your back while you watch the cop’s partner plant the drugs in your own car. You go to prison for it. Your life is forever changed. Or this, that you were a little tired coming home from work, and you swerved a little. The officer pulls you over and arrests you for a DUI, regardless of having a 0.0 BAC.

I luckily have not been a victim of police brutality. However, my own brother has. He approached a man and was asking for assistance. The man claimed he had a gun, which he didn’t. That was apparently all the proof the court needed to convict, and he went to prison for three years.

Please, tell me again that we are equal. Please, tell me again that we should protest peacefully. We tried that. He took a knee during the national anthem and was fired for it. Tell me again that I should just deal with how things are, and to learn my place. That I should understand that I am intimidating because of my skin tone.

No. I will not sit down. I will not make excuses anymore that this is okay. I do not want to have to explain to my daughter and son how to not get shot by a police officer, because no matter what we do, no matter how little we resist and go with the flow, we are injured. We are set up. We are jailed. We are MURDERED simply for existing. There is no more time to be quiet. Yes, all lives absolutely matter. But the problem is that black lives matter less than white lives. The system needs to change, and it starts with you.

Guy I blocked years ago has just turned up banging on my door for the second time in so many months,"It’s around 8pm Friday night here. Each time I’ve said loudly and firmly to “please leave me alone’ he then bangs on the door a bit more trying to aggressively open the door knob then hovers on my street for about 30 minutes before leaving. It’s scary and I’m not sure what I can do about the behaviour (not that it’s my responsibility!). It also makes me angry that he feels so entitled to my company. 

It doesn’t seem police report worthy, but it’s making me feel unsafe in my home. Any advice?

Update: just happened again 10:30pm 24/11/2022 I had gotten a guard dog breed a short while after the last incident (posted here) and it helped, dog warned me and barked like mad, asked him to go away through the door and he did straight away. It’s been 167 days since he last did this.

I've had to deal with quite a few, probably because I work in a field where I have to be friendly, so whenever I'm at work, I'm just always sunshine and rainbows unless there's a reason not to be, and a lot of men don't understand thay this ISN'T flirting.

Now, I get it, to a degree. I've even had respectful, unexpected advances that I don't mind at all, nust politely reject and we can move forward as friendly coworkers. But that's not always how it happens.

When I am on shift I am one of two people on staff, just two people alone, separated by a ~5 minute walk. We recently lost an employee, so a week ago this guy at least 10 years my senior, who works for a company that essentially just sends temps to companies that need extremely temporary staff to cover shifts for a bit, started working on shift with me. Im friendly with him, like everyone, but I barely see him or talk to him. He's computer illiterate, so I give him my cellphone # (which is clearly posted on his desk anyways) so we can video call and I can walk him through fixing his computer instead of walking all the way over to his post to do it for him. He texted me off the clock after the first or second night of us working together reminding me to recommend him for the permanent position. I did not respond.

 Tonight, out of nowhere, he texts me from his post.

Him: Can i ask you a question?

Here I'm thinking ""ugh, men should really be careful when they say those words. He probably just needs help with his computer again, but that sentence has implications.""

Me: Sure, what's up?

Him: are you single or married?

Me: Neither, why?

Him: i just want to know

Me: That's not really a conversation I'm comfortable with.

Him: I'm sorry about that

Him again: hope you are not angry about it?

Me: I'd like to drop it. Thank you.

First of all, I have never flirted with this man in my life. I have never had a conversation thay listed more than 5 minutes with him. I have never indicated any sort of interest in him. Second, I am practically alone with this person for 8 hours a night, and he is much older, bigger, and stronger than me. He made me incredibly uncomfortable with a blatant, unwelcome, unwarranted advance.

I used to freeze when this sort of thing happened to me. I'd hedge and skirt and try to just get out of the situation. Running ad hiding was always safer. But recently I've found my footing, and found that I won't let people just tromp all over my boundaries with jackboots because they are bigger and scarier than me.

Instead of being upset that I was uncomfortable, this man is worried that I'm no longer going to recommend him for the permanent position. Really? You hope I'm not angry, you don't hope that I'm not too uncomfortable, or that I still feel safe working with you? Bite me.

He is asking for me to make HIM feel comfortable, because me stating my boundaries and telling him that he vastly overstepped them made HIM feel uncomfortable. Fuck that. Fuck him. He gets to feel uncomfortable because of his own actions, its not my job to make him feel better.

Edit: There are a lot of men (wow, so many) who don't really understand what it is that's going on for a woman in this situation. There were a couple of points in the comments that I'd like to illustrate to maybe help share the perspective of a woman dealing with this.

First(from myself):
""A man, much older, larger, and stronger than myself, with whom I am forced to work for 8 hours, alone, at night, has made an unwanted advance.

That, in and of itself, is pretty worrisome, but consider something else for a moment. Women are stalked, hurt, and murdered just for rejecting men, even politely, all around the world, all the time. When he asks me that question, do I know how this man is going to react to me rejecting him? No. Now I'm afraid.

Does he hurt me? No, he hasn't yet. Thank goodness. Now I'm upset, because of the position he put me in.

Now he apologizes, but it's obviously not a very heartfelt apology, he doesn't care that much that i am uncomfortable and upset.

Now he continues the conversation that I told him I was uncomfortable with to ask if I am angry. He doesn't care about uncomfortable, upset, scared. He cares about angry, because if I'm angry I won't recommend him for the position he wants, and that directly affects him.

And now I have to continue going to work with this man, and he is likely going to know that I recommend /against/ his getting the position.

And that is the situation that he has put me in.""

Second(from @Kiyomondo): 

""Let me illustrate for you two VERY different situations.

Scene A: you are at a bar and find yourself talking to an attractive woman. She is smiling, maintaining eye contact, facing you directly, engaging in the conversation. You're having a great time and it looks like she is too. You ask her if she's single. Depending on her response you either exchange numbers or jokingly curse your bad luck and wish her all the best.

Scene B: you've just started a new job. Your senior employee gives you her number so she can video call you to help get your pc set up because you struggle with technology. She's polite, friendly, cheerful, always has a smile for everyone. If you make a good impression on her it could benefit your career at this company. You don't talk much, though, and you've never seen her outside of work. So you send her a message, hinting that you're interested in the permanent position. No response. Oh well, after all you did use her number for personal communication outside of work, which is not the reason she shared it with you. Maybe she doesn't like that. She's beautiful though. Is she single or married? Oops she got upset for some reason, better make sure you didn't jeopardise your chance at promotion!

One of these approaches is acceptable, the other is clearly not. If you can't tell ghe difference, you may be part of the problem""

SHOUT OUT TO THE AMAZING MODERATORS FOR KICKING SOME SERIOUS INCEL ASS OUT THERE! GO TEAM!",TwoXChromosomes,14088,1597141505.0,1701,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/i7pb9f/its_not_my_job_to_make_a_man_feel_comfortable/
I'm really scared that I'm starting to hate men. I don't know how to stop it.,"I'm angry *all the time*. I'm experiencing a tremendous amount of compassion fatigue. I feel so burnt out that I'm empty. I go from happy to *extremely* angry within seconds. This is not my baseline, it's not something I've ever experienced before. I'm an LCSW and I've started to recognize in myself extremist thoughts. When I see a man, my gut reaction is anger and hurt. I want to throw things and cry for a million years.

My clients are almost exclusively men struggling in relationships or sexually abused children. Almost all of my friends are men. My longtime partner is a man (who I love). I am surrounded by male voices and male thoughts all day. Normally, this doesn't bother me. I love my friends, I love (most) of my clients, and I intend to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend.

Since Trump won the second election, my mental health has plummeted. I am ***so angry***. I'm an American citizen, but I was born and spent half of my childhood in a dictatorship where women were essentially cattle. I was adopted and then moved to the US with my parents. My partner is also originally from an authoritarian country, and his family moved to the US when he was a young child.

I decided that if Trump won, then I would leave the US. I'm Asian, a woman, an immigrant (with US citizenship), and a CSA survivor with damage to my cervix, requiring IVF and surrogacy or adoption to start a family, and it just felt too unsafe. I've been country hopping, trying to find a place that feels like home. My partner has been *insanely* supportive. Unprompted, he told me that he's decided to sell his businesses (large-scale, profitable businesses.) and leave the country with me, and we can build a life somewhere safer. He's amazing. He is supportive. He listens. When he gets it wrong, he's open minded. When I get it wrong, he's patient. He is a good man.

Fast forward to now, my mental health is struggling. I'm blasted every day with information about what is happening in the US, how incredibly familiar it feels to the country I escaped from as a child. I've become ***significantly*** less tolerant of sexism and the mild sexual harassment women experience daily. I go from 0 to 100 in a flash. When I see a man, my first thought is that there's a 1 in 4 chance he's a rapist, and if he isn't a rapist, he's friends with one,  and then I feel rage and genuine hatred towards him. This completely random guy I know nothing about. I'm not talking about the men who leer or overstep, I get angry with men who I see across the street. I have started to associate men with oppression.

The problem is, I don't know how I feel about it. It has damaged my relationship with the men in my life, including my boyfriend. The small sexist things said or did, that honestly almost all men do, that used to never bother me, now **incense** me.

Ten minutes ago, my boyfriend was asking for my advice about the best way to fire one of his employees, and then after I gave him advice, he made a joke that I could understand the employees perspective because we're both super emotional. I ***RAGED*** at him in a way that is NOT proportional to his behavior. I have been super emotional lately, it's not a secret, and he's handled it really fucking well... but I attacked him and called him sexist, and even though his comment is something that is used against women all the time, it's not what he meant, and I knew that it wasn't what he meant when he said it. But i still lashed out. He does have friends who are very sexist, and while it is something I tolerated before, I now think about every.single.day. I get angry out it, out of the blue, almost every day. I want to tell him that he needs to cut them out, but very obviously, that is not my place. He also confronts them when they are sexist (for the egregious stuff. He ignores the moderate to mild sexism from them) and it's caused me to lose a lot of respect for him. It's damaged how I feel about him. I still love him, I still want to be with him, but I don't feel as safe with him as I used to be. I think my feelings are somewhat fair, but probably not to the extent that I feel them. I'm making small pebbles into mountains, because I feel like I've been tripping over these pebbles my whole damn life and I just want to be able to walk on even ground with everyone else.

Yesterday, I spent *hours* arguing with a school teacher in the comments of a *deleted posted that no one would ever see or read*, because he was trying to argue that it's traumatizing for little boys to ask if it's ok before they put their arm around the shoulder or try to hold hands with a girl. He wasn't an asshole. Some of his points were even fair, but I wanted to burn the world down over it. I can't enjoy the TV Shows I like anymore. My boyfriend and I love Impractical Jokers, but I recently found out that half of them have been predatory towards minor girls and at least one of them was accused of sexual assault, and now I feel sick watching it. We both love Nathan for You, but there was a sexist joke (not by Nathan) in the episode last night, and it ruined it for me. Every tv show I watch insults women in some way. All of a sudden, I feel like my eyes are open and I'm realizing how normalized sexism has become.

I used to have patience with my male clients who displayed indicators of being sexist, focusing on education and helping them to better understand the prospective of women, because most of the time (at least with my clients) it comes from a place of ignorance or pain, and can be resolved with education. But now, I'm pissed off. For example, before this, when it became clear that a client's girlfriend does not enjoy having sex with him, I focused on education, teaching him about female pleasure, consent, the importance of connection, ensuring that she receives three times as many nonsexual touches than she does sexual touches, etc... but now, when I hear about a 35 year old man in a 4 year relationship who doesn't know where the fucking clit is, I want to scream into the void and hang up on him. (Obviously, I do neither of these things). But my boyfriend pointed out that I have been audibly been saying multiple times a day, ""I hate men"". I didn't even notice I was doing it.

I think that I genuinely hate most men now. I hate strangers. I hate the men I love. I hate all of them. It makes me sad and scared.. but I'm also unwilling to continue pretending to laugh at jokes I don't think are funny, accepting the bulk of the emotional labor of relationships, tolerating small sexist comments (for example, *anytime* my male best friend talks about how good his boss is at her job, he ALWAYS mentions how small she is and how no one would ever guess how smart and tough she is. I never *liked* it when he said things like that, but now, I haven't spoken to him in three days, and I caught myself seriously considering *ending a 5 year friendship over it*.

I feel at a loss. I don't know what to do. I don't even know what I *want* to do, but I can feel myself being radicalized, I can feel myself becoming an angry person. I don't want this to be my life- but I also refuse to accept less because I'm a woman. Is there a way for me to stop placating men and still have them in my life? Will they accept this new me who doesn't pretend anymore, or will I slowly lose everyone I love? The only way I know how to stop the radicalization of myself is to start being authentic about who I am and how I feel. I'm angry, I'm hurt, and I'm tired of listening to men talk about how shocked they are that their 5'2 98lb boss is good at her fucking job.

I don't know if I'm asking for help or validation or a wake-up call that I'm unwell. I don't know what to do.

I think I hate men, and I hate being a woman. I'm really sad.

**Update:** First, thank you so much. I was in a really bad place yesterday. I felt numb and empty and hopeless, and this morning I'm full of hope. I've realized that I don't hate men. I'm scared of men. I don't want them to hurt me or my sisters anymore, and I don't know how to protect myself from them. That constant fear turned into anger and then resentment and then contempt. When I posted yesterday, I just wanted someone to tell me that I wasn't losing my mind, and I am *so thankful* for all the kind words, validation, thoughtful questions, gentle challenges, and constructive criticism. I have made notes of all of the resources and advice, and I'm starting my healing journey today.

My boyfriend saw my post on the front page of Reddit and immediately knew it was me. He wasn't angry, he was supportive. He also said that he'd always wanted the experience of randomly reading about himself on Reddit haha. He's a good egg, and I'm very grateful to have him as my life partner.

Today, I am starting a week detox from all social media to reset my brain. I also called my therapist, and we're going to meet twice a week until I feel more myself.

I have taken a vacation from work, and will be transitioning away from triggering clients. I don't know if it's for now, or forever, but that's a decision for another day.

My boyfriend will be monitoring my Reddit account and sharing your kind words, but please don't misinterpret my lack of response as a lack of gratitude. I just need a break for a bit.

I have a long list of recommended books, movies, documentaries, and lectures to dive into tomorrow. But for today, I intend to watch Critical Role in my pajamas with the people I love.

Thank you again.

To the man who pulled me aside while my friends talked to yours,"Thank you. You pulled me aside and let me know that your friends were bad people planning bad things to do to girls. You put your arm around me like you were making a move and told me quietly that if I was feeling unsafe with them, I should leave now. That they were all fucked up on Molly and other drugs. That they were just kicked from two bars for fights and being too fucked up. That they would try and pressure my roommate into stuff she wouldn't want to do (as I saw them trying to do so). Told his friends to leave me alone and let me talk to her (as they kept trying to keep me and her away from each other). Told my roommate that he was afraid for her and she needed to leave with me. Shook my hand and gave me a hug and told me to get home safely and then walked off with his friends, telling them they are dicks. His friends were assholes to him the whole time. Whoever you are mark, I hope you find better friends because you deserve better friends. I felt so validated and respected as a person and as a woman that he understood my uncomfortableness, understood the danger to me and my friend and helped us to get to a better situation (as at this point the guys were pressuring her to go to their place and do... Graphic acts that she kept saying no to and had followed us back to her car).

"I was almost taken/trafficked in Austin, Tx","This is the most traumatizing thing that's ever happened to me. I have never told most people about this and I want to get the word out to other women about how easily this can happen, how quickly you can be caught off guard, and how even safe places can have predators. 

It was terrifyingly similar to the actual movie Taken, but it happened in Austin, Tx. There is a very popular bar district downtown here, it's like a strip and super busy with college kids. I was 21 years old and I was out with my husband and 4 of his friends (all guys). So it was me and 5 decent sized men and this still happened. 

We were all out drinking and having a great time. I had stopped on the busy street in front of one of the bars to talk to a door guy I knew, and my husband and the guys walked off in front of me. I had just said bye to the door guy and I was trailing behind the guys by about 15 feet. I was noticeably drunk, I was stumbling a bit. I'm a small woman, 90 lbs. Suddenly a car pulls over next to me and rolls down the window, it's a charismatic and good-looking guy in his 20s. He goes ""Hey! I'm your uber! Get in"" and unlocks the door. I looked over and felt ever-so-slightly off and went ""No, I didn't call an uber"" and kept walking. The car started rolling along next to me and the guy is saying through the window ""No you didn't call, your friend called. We're here to pick you up. Get in."" And I stopped walking, for the slightest second, and glanced to the car with a funny face. By that point I knew it was weird. It was already happening so fast, maybe 20 seconds went by so far. As soon as my eyes landed on the car, the driver turned to the backseat and said something fast in another language. The backdoor flies open and there are 2 other guys sitting there, about his same age, and they are all eastern-european (maybe greek?) with accents.  My eyes went wide and the guys lunged forward, grabbed me by the waist and yanked me into the car. I was gone and in the car in under a second. I screamed in the loudest, most blood curdling way I could muster, NOOOOOOOO. My husband's best friend about 15 feet ahead hears me first, stops dead in his tracks and starts bolting towards me. The driver starts driving right away and the guys in the back try slamming the door behind me.

They had my wrists but I stuck my leg between the car and the door right before he tried to slam it, so it bounced off my leg and my husband's best friend grabs the door. Then they  pulled my leg in and were able to shut the door and lock it. 

I'm screaming, they're driving away. The rest of my group is running to us, the bouncer we were in front of comes running to me, and him and husband's best friend run after the car a few feet and yank me out of the still open window by my arms, while the car is still moving.  I'm still screaming and kicking. On my way out of the car I kick the driver in the chest. They sped away, turned and were gone.

I'm crying. My husband is crying. The bouncer calls the police to report it. It's a whole scene. I left immediately, I rushed home in a panic and didn't stay around for the report. Don't know if anything ever happened with it. I never gave them my information. I was honestly so traumatized and in a state of shock that I never did anything or told anyone else. My friends that were with me (and my husband primarily) struggled with tremendous guilt for a long time. Nobody felt like they reacted fast enough, or harsh enough, or just that they let me lag behind at all. It changed all of us forever and I'm still terrified of being anywhere alone and of being taken. 

I was 21 and I was basically kidnapped. There were a few seconds I was completely locked in the car and they were driving off, holding me tightly and restraining my limbs. They were talking a foreign language and I knew in that moment 100% that I would be trafficked and thought it would be the last time I ever saw my husband or my friends. 

It was a perfectly normal night in a well-lit, busy, decent area of town and I was with a group of men who would've protected me. And they pounced on me immediately because they thought I was alone. 

Be extremely wary of cab drivers and people claiming they are uber and lyft when you are out. Always confirm on the app that someone is your driver, and never stand too close to cars when you are on the sidewalk. I know that last one may seem paranoid, but if you are in a vulnerable position (I was drunk, dressed sexy, seemingly alone outside of a club), you need to be extremely wary of your surroundings and how quickly the unexpected can happen. 

Please be careful. Please be safe. Please report anything suspicious. Be vigilant. ",TwoXChromosomes,25966,1532737042.0,1909,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/92hu6m/i_was_almost_takentrafficked_in_austin_tx/
Why do guys think women are OBLIGATED to talk to them in public?,"Went to the laundromat this morning, sweaty and bothered, I’m having a rough pms. Dude pulls up next to me in a bright orange jeep. He gets out and he’s wearing matching bright orange shorts and flip flops. Honestly I give him props for having a favorite color and sticking to it. I barely notice him. 

I sit in my car and watch videos on my phone and wait for my laundry to be done. As my timer gets close I gather my stuff, I look up and realize this dude is leaning on his car directly in front of my driver side door. He’s on his phone too but I’m sketched that he’s choosing to be right in my way. My windows aren’t tinted so I waved to show him that I’m about to open my door. Of course he moves just enough for me to open the door. I squeeze out. 

“Yo, Im still going to need to get by you.” I pointed to the door behind him, my tone was not friendly.

“Wait, Ive been wanting to talk to you.” He was giving me a weird smirk and not wearing a mask. 

“Well that was a dumb fucking plan. Block my way so I will talk to you? Fuck you dude.” I started walking to the other side of the car and he ran ahead to the laundromat door to hold it for me. 

“C’mon, I just want to chat with you. Why are you being angry like that?” He leaned close to me when I went through the door. 

“No! You’re really pissing me the fuck off. Just leave me alone. I’m not going to tell you again!”

He shut up when I raised my voice and other people in the laundromat started to listen in and give him a dirty look. 

I told a female attendant about him and pointed to him and she took down his license and said if he comes in she will kick him out. Honestly I was really happy with her response. Fuck dudes who corner women because “I want to talk to you”. I don’t give a fuck whatever you have to say. I WILL make a scene.

Already got an angy boi in my DMS:

Private message from u/smithsmiths: “FYI most guys don't think women are obligated to speak to them. Before you go off on a rant about how ""nOt aLl men"" is a bad argument, that's the same logic racists use to discriminate against certain groups of people.” 

My response: “Here’s the deal. Racism is a system of oppression against people of color. Just like sexism is a system of oppression against women. So you saying “most guys don’t” is like telling me “All lives matter” in response to “black lives matter” it’s an inherently sexist response. Women cannot oppress men. Women live everyday in opposition to a system that has created and routinely supported harassment/sexualization/discrimination of women. So yea. Get fucked and leave women alone.”

PSA: Addressing the most ‘triggering’ phrase: I’m talking about *systemic* oppression when I say women cannot oppress men. You can’t be the oppressors in a system you don’t hold power in. Men can definitely be victims of sexual assault, abuse etc by women/by men. A system built by cis men harms women and LGBTQ the most, then other men but don’t worry we’re gonna fix it - it’s just slow work.

A man threatened to shoot me because I declined his advances,"This happened last night, and I am still shocked and upset.

I \[36F\] am travelling for work in a southern beach town, and I stayed an extra night for a little bit of R&amp;R that only the beach can offer! I decided to take myself out to a nice seafood dinner to celebrate a big work win earlier in the day. I take myself out to dinner often - I have zero issue sitting at a table by myself, ordering what I want, and playing on my phone. 

Other people sometimes have an issue with it, particularly men. They view it as an opportunity to hit on me, talk to me....etc... Sometimes it becomes an issue, sometimes it doesn't. Well, tonight it became a big issue.

I am having a great time eating my oysters and watching Legally Blonde on my phone - when I hear over my headphones a man with large party loudly talking about how '16 or 17 wasn't so bad' and being greeted with laughter. I take out my headphones and hear him going on and on about trying to have sex with a young girl and how '16 or 17 isn't so bad'

I was mortified that there were women sitting at this table, laughing along with him. Everyone was laughing along with him. I mean, I was raised in the south (I don't live there now) but I have obviously forgotten how bad things are down here. 

So at this time I also see people from the table glancing and looking at me. Great. They probably realized I was judging them for their comments. Finally, a man gets up and walks over to my table and sits down with me.

He says, ""I just had to come over here""

Me: ""Why?""

Him: ""Because I'm single. I wanted to come talk to you.""

Me: ""Oh, I overheard you guys talking about having sex with 16 and 17 years olds, I'm not interested.""

A shadow crossed this mans face, and he glared at me and stood up. (I would like to point out that he did literally nothing to defend himself. Like - I would assume that someone who did not engage in that conversation would be confused and defensive?) He walks back over to his table and yells ""She is a fucking bitch! She said we want to fuck children! I'm going to shoot her in the fucking face!"" And storms out of the restaurant.

Thankfully there were two men on a date at the table right beside me, and they checked on me to see if I was OK. The manager eventually came over to check on me too, but then he didn't do anything. He didn't ask the table to leave, or offer to safely get me to my ride. 

Eventually, another waitress came over and said that table wanted to buy me a drink. I told her ""You've got to be kidding right? Absolutely not.""

I have eaten by myself in Vegas, LA, Detroit, and huge cities all over the country - and I have never felt more unsafe than I did as a solo woman dining alone in the south. I'm not coming back anytime soon.

EDIT:
Thanks so much for all of the wonderful support. You all are the best. I appreciate all the suggestions that I should have called the police, and I honestly didn’t think of it. I was actually pretty scared, because the table kept glaring at me after he left. I called an Uber and it took 15 minutes to arrive. I hated that they kept looking at me, and it was making me really uncomfortable, but I also knew better than to wait outside. Hopefully this doesn’t happen again, but if it does I will now remember that!

As far as people defending the south in this thread. Oof. I’m not here to offend people. If you know, you know. That’s it.",TwoXChromosomes,10930,1649505110.0,622,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/tzrmfq/a_man_threatened_to_shoot_me_because_i_declined/
The guy who raped me (more than once at College) contacted me to apologise. Not sure what to make of the conversation. (TW: discussion of rape),"
This is still somewhat surreal even though this was a few years ago. This was the message that I recieved from the guy who raped me (more than once) at college:



Hi,

I sincerely hope that life is treating you well and you are feeling good.

I hope this message isn’t an intrusion on your happiness. But, fuck, I miss you like crazy. 

I understand that I was a special sort of Cunt.

I know that I don’t even warrant a thought. But I think of you often. I realise that my behaviour was beyond reprehensible. I just wish that I still knew you.

Feel free to ignore this.

I just turned 25 and know I still think about you daily and wish I had done the right thing for you and by you.

I hope you have the best of everything and are happy.

AGAIN!!! Feel free to ignore this and feel no way. This message is no doubt all about me.

Stay beautiful and powerful.

Faithfully,
M




The message made me feel sick (especially the choice of words intrusion and powerful). I’d suppressed what had happened up until that point. I didn’t reply until a few years later. 

He responded immediately and expressed remorse. However, I’m not sure about other sections of the conversation and not sure how I feel about them. So I’ve included the entire conversation (which is the reason this post is so horrifically long). I just wondered whether anyone could cast their eye over it and give me their opinion. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this. 

To provide context. This is what he actually did to me at college (the stage before university in the UK):

We were part of a friendship group of three very close best friends. I was a people-pleaser, incredibly shy. A girly girl. M the guy who raped me was the kind of kid your parents tell you not to hang around with because they’re bad news. However, he was popular, confident and very witty. C was the opposite; a computer nerd. Who lived for World of Warcraft. He was very socially awkward and didn’t like people very much particularly women.

No one could understand why we were friends as we didn’t match. But there is some kind of magnetic pull between people with high levels of childhood trauma. We were dubbed by ‘the 3 musketeers’ by other students and it wasn’t long before the teachers referred to us in the same way.

Initially everything was amazing. I’d never had a friend more in tune with me than M. He was one of those friends who could tell how you were feeling by looking at you. He was initially incredibly receptive to my needs, very kind and caring. Which was a breath of fresh air as I had a very dysfunctional and abusive home life (as did he), had been bullied at secondary school and had no real friends. 

But after some time M started to show a romantic intrest in me which I didn’t take well and wasn’t reciprocated. My lack of reciprocated intrest lead him to start mistreating me. Some days he would be nice to me others he would give me the silent treatment or say unkind things. I never knew what mood he’d be in. 

SA was sadly normalised at college. He’d previously slapped my bum, pulled me onto his lap, put his hands up my top, but his behavior wasn’t too different from other boys at college and it was passed off as banter. So it didn’t set the alarm bells off that it should have. The first time I become consciously wary of him he blew up at me at the college Christmas party because I’d talked to another guy. When I reminded him he wasn’t my boyfriend he threw me against some railings. 

The first time he raped me was about a year and a half into our friendship. We were at his house which wasn’t unusual. But this time C hadn’t turned up. We’d drunk a lot of vodka and Fanta fruit twist. I didn’t hold my alcohol as well as he did so I went to bed. I awoke to him in the bed with me with his hands in my underwear. 

There was a struggle between us. I tried to reason with him. I told him that we weren’t going to have sex to which he replied “how about this?” “If I can get it in I win”. M was 6’3 and about double my weight so he won. After he’d finished to further humiliate me he said “you’re mine now. I can see my cum coming out of you”. Even though what happen had devastated me I didn’t call it rape. I hadn’t fought hard enough, I blamed myself. 

The next time I saw him he’d told everyone at college. I felt physically sick and humiliated. He was adamant we were now a couple. When I challenged this narrative he got angry and held me against a wall and shoved his tounge down my throat. Thankfully another student saw and asked me if I was okay and he stopped. 

Not long after that he followed me home. I told him to leave me alone but he said he wouldn’t until I talked to him. He was insistent that we were now a couple. I was insistent that we weren’t. The conversation went nowhere. When I arrived home and opened the door. Rather than walk away he pushed his way into my house. “My mums home so you need to go” I said “no she’s not she’s never home at this time?” He replied. 

He didn’t waste time in pulling me into my bedroom. At this point it dawned on me that he was probably going to rape me. I kept begging him to stop “please let’s just talk” “please don’t do this”. I tried to get passed him but he grabbed me, pushed me down onto my bed and raped me. When he was finished he stood over me smiling as I lay there in shock and disbelief “Thanks that was hot” pushed a cigarette behind his ear and walked out.  

The last time he raped me was about a year later at the prom after party at one of my new friends houses. Eveyone had turned up. By this point we weren’t friends (had new friendship groups) and we didn’t talk. He had failed his exams and was doing an intensive course. I was finishing my last year. If we bumped into one another in the corridor he would often stare at me to make me feel uncomfortable. Sometimes he would skowl at me. 

Anyway, stupidly I drank too much and went upstairs to my friends room and fell asleep. I woke up face down to him raping me. I froze. I know it was M because I could see his watch. I didn’t say anything, I didn’t move, I was just frozen. When he was done he removed an orange durex wrapper from the bedside table pulled my underwear up. Put my dress back down and left the room. 

A few years later it all came up again when I watched the 13 reasons why series. M was the real life Bryce Walker. Jessica’s rape in particular hit me hard. It was like watching my own story! It confirmed that what he’d done to me was terribly wrong and wasn’t my fault. C had blamed me, minimised it and I’d believed him.

I had an overwhelming desire to confront M. So, I drank a few glasses of wine, took a deep breath and replied to his message.

This is the entire conversation between my rapist and I:




Me: Hi, When you messaged me I wasn’t really ready to speak to you if I’m honest. It took me a long time to even be able to open the message. I wasn’t anywhere near ready to face everything that went on when we were at college. But recently that has changed for several reasons and now I’m ready to talk. Will await your reply.

Him: Hi thanks for the message. Am I allowed to ask what has bought this on?

Me: Well, since you messaged me it opened up negative feelings and emotions I had buried. However, the catalyst came when I watched the series 13 reasons why and I actually had to switch it off mid episode because it was too close to home (I don’t know if you’ve seen it). You betrayed me horrifically. What you did to me has affected me greatly and made me feel like absolute shit for so long. 

Him: I probably would have switched it off for the same reason. Before anything else. I definitely owe you an apology. It doesn't mean anything, really. But, I know that I conducted myself in a manner that was outright disgusting. Nothing can atone and nothing can take it back- I still look back with a great sense of shame and disappointment. 

What was an amazing friendship turned dark and that was all on me. I carry the guilt with me. I have been wanting to speak to you for a long time, but I did not want to provoke any negative memories. So I am grateful you got in contact. You didn't owe me that kindness. I am honestly so sorry and I don’t deserve it but you have done my mental health a service today by contacting me.

Me: Thank you for being so honest it means a lot. What made you message me?

Him: I was trying to reach out you taught me so much without even realising. You still look exactly the same btw it’s nuts. Even though a lot of my backstory was fabricated - it makes no difference to the fun times we all had together

Me: thanks. What do you mean fabricated? 

Him: L we were so young. It’s such a shame. It was the best time of my fucking life up until it all went to shit. Fucking all-nighters and last minute parties. C falling out that ground floor window (I’m still convinced you pushed him 😉), C off his face fighting lampposts and smashing his glasses, J setting his shoe on fire in your bedroom. Do you remember all that? 🤣🤣🤣

Me: Yes I remember it all. Like an extended  episode of Skins. For the record I didn’t push him I was just standing near him.  What do you mean by fabricated? 

Him: Yeah I belive you 😉 I’m sure they based that TV show on us!

Me: I’m pretty sure it came out a good few years before we met. Yes it’s a shame those fun memories were ruined. I don’t really like thinking about that time now. 

Just the final thing I wanted to ask. Kind of a closure thing. Why did you do that to me? I didn’t consent. Sex without consent is rape. I’m sure I don’t have to explain that to you. I understand it’s probably a bit of a hard question to answer but it would be really helpful to me.

Him: You are welcome to get whatever answers you want from me. There’s no reason for what I did to you. I was unhealthily obsessed with you. No 2 ways about it. A 17-18 year old messed up kid with a lack of self awareness. The relativity of consequences just didn't exist at that point. I didn’t respect your wishes or boundaries I just acted like a fucking cunt. I was an absolute twat and arsehole of the highest order. And you never deserved ANY of it. 

If you take anything away- understand I know exactly what I done to you and how it made you feel. I also know exactly what it cost me. My mental health isn’t the best and has been a lot worse since. It isn’t much of an answer but it’s all I can give. I guess I will find the answers in Hell.

Me: thanks I don’t really know what to say. This is pretty heavy 

Him: yes pretty intense. Just know it’s a great source of shame and embarrassment and the guilt is my burden to bear forever. Well, now, anyway. When I messaged you before I also took the hint and know you didn't owe me a chance to apologise. So I am glad you provided me the opportunity. Thank you.

Me: I spoke with C about this recently. I don’t know if you’re aware but we maintained a friendship after college though it’s been fraught at times. Mainly because of what happened and the fact he fought your corner and not mine. But he’s come to a stage now where he’s realised his response to what happened was wrong. 

C confessed to me that there was some kind of agreement that you were both interested in me and you'd agreed to 'let the best man win' This was unbelievably hurtful to hear as I thought the friendship was genuine. That I was some kind of game between you both. It's objectifying and dehumanising.

Him: Wtf? Just for the record... there was no ""let the best man win"" competition. 

Me: Why would he make that up?

Him: I honestly don't know why C would say that. Probably in an attempt to further villainise me (not that needed to happen)
I'm already a complete an utter peice of shit and beyond for my previous actions

Me: I don’t know what to believe 

Him: It's OK. He always has been a little snakey. I'm struggling to see what he had to gain from that. He knew I always liked you.
I had no idea that there was a
""competition"" because he also liked you...

I just want you to know since everything happened, I haven't been able to get close to anyone (friendship). Haven't even been able to maintain any kind of social bond. Everything has been superficial. I knew what I done was wrong. I knew I had no right to feel sorry for myself, I knew that whatever negative shit I was going through was well deserved. Well I went through a phase where I couldn't stand to be sober. I'd be drunk or high... both. I'd do drugs and other stupid shit - bollocks to the consequences.

I'm not looking for sympathy, or understanding. Fuck, even talking to you know makes my chest hurt. The remorse is crushing and I have absolutely no fucking right for you to even read what I say. The gratitude I feel being able to express my regret and offer an apology is immense. 

Me: I’m sorry you went through that. I hope things are better for you now. 

Him: I'm still a little shocked about the news with C. Would explain why he hasn’t spoken to me in a while. But anyway fuck him. 

After I sent you that message and you didn’t reply. I blocked your profile for a while so I couldn’t look at it  - nothing personal, it just hurt a bit, seeing you. Luckily I unblocked you not to long ago. So you were able to send me this message. You can have my phone number. Feel free to get at me any time. I heard you got engaged. Are you married yet or what?!

Me: we’re getting married this summer. 

Him: Congratulations!!! Even though your life is about to change in the biggest of ways and despite your previous experience of me being a terrible person; who I am now is entirely different and I may be able to offer you support or advice. I have 2 kids now. I imagine you will want kids? 

Me: yes we want children 

Him: don’t have them! Pregnancy and childbirth are horrific. And kids are ungrateful tiring little shits (partly joking about that).. since having our first my Mrs won’t go anywhere near me. The only time she wanted it was when she wanted to get pregnant. Anyway that’s another story. Have you seen my daughter? 

Me: wow okay. yes she’s gorgeous 

Him: notice anything? 

Me: she’s incredibly cute 

Him: yes but she’s literally my twin. Come on? Keep up! 🙃

Me: yes she does look like you 

Him: Anyway i’m not expecting us to be besties, I'm not expecting us to ever talk again, really- just support you and provide information.

Me: sorry I can’t. Too much has happened. I forgive you but the friendship ended the minute you did that to me. It doesnt feel right. I can’t pretend what happened didn’t happen. 

Him: I will save you the trouble of looking at my profile again by blocking you so I don’t pop up in your friends list. Im not pretending that shit was OK- because it wasn't, isn't and never will be. I won’t contact you again. I will leave my number if you have any other questions. 

Thank you for being my friend.

Thank you for being a good person.

I am sorry that you met me and that I hurt you the way I did.

I sincerely wish you the best in life. 

Me: I don’t hate you. Thank you for replying. Thank you for being honest. I don’t think most people would have.

Him: I will delete this conversation on my end, I don’t want to ever look at it again but, I will still be available to contact- by phone just in case in the future you are able to talk to me again. I can't NOT hate myself for what I did, L. I have a lot to love myself for too, but, I would be dishonest in “forgetting"" what I did. We're all human. I sincerely wish you the best in life. I’m sorry 



My head is scrambled. I believe this is a confession. He expressed remorse yet at points I didn’t feel like he wasn’t taking it as seriously as he should have and said some things that were inappropriate and insensitive. 

I’m grateful that I got some closure and remorse I know most victims don’t and I’m grateful for that but it still doesn’t feel right. 

Any thoughts I’d be very grateful for. 

Edit: Thank you so much for all the people who have taken time not only to read this as it’s so long but to leave comments. It’s given me such clarity and I now have a perfect understanding of why it all felt so wrong. I hesitated for some time before posting here but this is the best thing I’ve done. I just wish I’d posted before I messaged him. 

My main takeaways are he is a highly disordered, dangerous person and I need to protect myself at all costs. I also need to start therapy. I now have enough evidence to gain advice from a lawyer.

I'd like to leave this here... How To Protect Yourself From False Rape Allegations,"How To Protect Yourself From False Rape Allegations--
 (credit to @DanielleMuscato on Twitter/insta/patreon and u/DanielleMuscato on reddit) 

I'm seeing a lot of scared men right now. My heart aches for you. I get it: You're just trying to go about your day when in a mere instant, your whole life could be turned upside down. It's a scary world—you could lose everything, just because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time.

With that in mind, I present my Top 10 Tips for Staying Safe from false rape accusations:

1. If you go to a party, either have only one drink, or only drink soda or water, so you can keep your wits about you. Never get tipsy around people you don't know and trust fully—it could come back to haunt you later. Even around people you fully trust, remember that most false rape allegations come from people you know. Be vigilant!

2. Use the buddy system, so you always have a witness! Only go to the bathroom with a friend, or ideally with a group of friends. Always have a friend walk you to your car, in case you run into a strange woman in the parking garage. Never go camping or hiking or biking or running or even just walking alone. NEVER go to a bar or concert or party or event alone; that is just asking for it.

3. If you're going out anywhere, make sure you text the specifics of your plans to at least one or two trusted friends, in case they need to verify your whereabouts to police later. You may also consider using a location sharing app so you have proof of where you were and when.

4. If you're going to exercise, make sure that you bring a friend, or even better, just exercise at home. Never go through a park alone. There might be a woman there who could accuse you.

5. When you're heading to class or work, never listen to music or podcasts on headphones. You need to listen carefully to your surroundings to make sure no woman is accusing you of anything.

6. When you're getting into your car at the end of the day, always check your backseat to make sure there aren't any women hiding back there. Never take shortcuts through alleys or parking lots that aren't extremely well lit, in case a woman is hiding there, waiting to accuse you.

7. Only take out the trash, walk the dog, get your mail, go to the ATM, or get gas during daylight hours. Most false rape accusations happen at night, and you don't want to become a statistic. If you MUST go out alone at night, make sure to get your phone out of your pocket and start recording video. Grasp the phone between your fingers so it's not obvious, but keep it ready in case a strange woman approaches you.

8. It's expensive to take Uber or Lyft all the time, I know. But never use public transportation after dark. It's just too risky. Indecent exposure and groping accusations are very common on the subway, and you can easily avoid this by simply taking a cab instead. Protect yourself.

9. Never rent ground-floor apartments, and make sure you lock all your windows at night, even if it's hot out. You never know if a woman is going to break into your bedroom to accuse you while you are asleep.

10. Last but not least, even if you follow all these tips, you could still be falsely accused. After all, no matter what steps you take to prevent it, it's simply a fact of life that every year, a low single-digit percentage of rape allegations will turn out to be false, on par with other false allegations of felonies, and that's just a sad truth we all have to live with. You can take precautions, but that's all you can do.
Hope this helps.


-This is clearly satire however it does depict an interesting parallel to what women have been constantly told to prevent being raped, which then tends to put blame on the victim when it does happen.

Edit: fixed weird word bolding

Edit 2: as I've stated to some of the initial comments I am not the author of this piece, I wish I knew who was so I can credit them but when I stumbled upon it (on Facebook) it was reposted as a comment without credit. I just wanted to share because. It's an interesting think piece that might allow for some discussion and parallels to be drawn. The only part I personally wrote was the end to explain its satirical.

Edit 3: the word sarcastic to satire because this post isn't meant to come off as dismissing false rape accusations but is instead a commentary on victim blaming and these exact points being constantly told to women so that they can prevent being raped.

UPDATE:
 AUTHOR FOUND PLEASE GIVE HER ALL THE CREDIT! @DanielleMuscato on Twitter/insta/patreon and u/DanielleMuscato on reddit she did an amazing think piece on Twitter that lead to this post ""what would you do if men had a 9 pm curfew"" and the responses are fascinating! Go check it out give her a follow, she also hosts @RESISTpodcast, and is a civil rights activist so please show her some love!! 

Her message:
I'm the author of the post about how to avoid false allegations, although for some reason I appear to be unable to post on /r/TwoXChromosomes.

As you said, yes, this is clearly satire. The purpose of satire is not to belittle serious problems but to shame society into improving itself. As a civil-rights activist, writer, and public speaker, I do not see satire, aka humor-as-activism, as a negative thing by any stretch, especially when it works.

I got the idea for this post based on responses by thousands of women to a recent tweet of mine that went viral, in which I asked fellow women, as a thought experiment: ""What would you do if all men had a 9pm curfew?"" and imploring men to read the replies and learn something from us. I don't think I'm allowed to link to it directly, but it's easy to find if you google it and currently pinned on my Twitter (my Reddit username is my real name).

I'm glad this has resonated with so many people, both women and men and nonbinary folks. Street harassment, rape, date rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment are overwhelmingly familiar topics to every single woman I know, and sadly, every girl I know, too. Even though these crimes are overwhelmingly committed by men against women, most (straight, cis) men seem to be either completely oblivious to this issue at all, or barely cognizant of it as a real problem.

Things are JUST STARTING to change with #metoo—and now with the Kavanaugh hearings—I feel like we're at the cusp of a very real shift in the way society approaches what is normal and acceptable for courtship, was is normal and acceptable for workplace behavior, and what is normal and acceptable behavior for acquaintances and strangers. We are having a real moment for women's rights and I'm beyond thrilled that men are finally starting to understand the depth and universality of this horrible reality.

I walked out on a date with a guy over COVID.,"I got into a conversation online with a guy and he asked me out for a date to a bar. I agreed under specific terms: it had to be a bar that was following social distancing, outdoor seating with spread out tables, and I wanted to be as far away from anyone else as humanly possible. All seemed fine, he chose the bar as I'm not familiar to the area, I checked online and saw they had a huge outdoor area (think backyard sized) with picnic tables far apart from each other. 

Cue to date night, I get to the bar masked up and he approaches me and goes in for a hug. I backup a few steps and remind him I wanted distance. He seemed disappointed but listened (a little begrudgingly). His mask wasn't all the way over his nose and any attraction I'd had for him basically died right away. We go around the side of the bar to the back and the back area is PACKED. At least 50 people, all in large groups, no one wearing masks. I immediately stop and ask him if he knows somewhere else we can go because I'm not comfortable going anywhere near that cesspool of virus potential. 

He tells me I'm being paranoid and I need to loosen up, it's not cute to guys for a girl to be so uptight. COVID isn't a big deal anyway blah blah blah. I immediately went off (respectfully, wasn't trying to get murdered) and told him about how I had gotten the virus back in March, how painful it was, how scared I had been, how depressing and mentally taxing quarantine had been. I then told him if I couldn't trust him to protect myself, himself, and others from the virus, how could I trust being around him in general? How do I know if we decided to have sex at some point he wouldn't just slip the condom off because there's 'only x chance of getting this STI/STD and it's treatable so what's the big deal'.

Long story short I left and went home and had ice cream. People, being an idiot during a pandemic isn't hot. Of anything it's probably one of my biggest turn offs now. Happily single for the duration of this pandemic it seems.

Edit; holy shit this blew up overnight. To the people offering support thank you, I really appreciate it. To the people saying I'm virtue signalling, or talking about how I shouldn't have even left my house in the first place, the only reason I ever even agreed to go was because 

A. At that time in the area we were living in our cases were at a record low, this was not recent during a spike

B. It is possible to safely interact with new people following CDC guidelines. The reason I agreed to go to the place was because the tables were large, and spaced out by at least 10 feet, and there was supposedly contactless ordering (order and pay on your phone, pick up your order at a drop off window also outside so no need to be indoors at all, and no seeing or interacting with staff members. Whether this was actually what they were doing I don't know because I didn't step foot in the yard area). This place was meant to be safe for a socially distanced meetup which was the intention, and when that turned out to not be the case, I left. 

C. He seemed to have no issues when I told him I wanted to keep my distance and that I had requirements as I haven't been or gone near a restaurant or bar since the pandemic took off back in February-ish. I was explicitly clear that I wouldn't be going near him, or any other person at this time as I had been isolated working from home, and having my groceries delivered so I hadn't even really left my house in months. He seemed okay with all these terms, I'm guessing because he assumed I would just give in and be walked all over cause I was so mentally drained and exhausted from isolating so long. That was not the case sadly for him lmao",TwoXChromosomes,11784,1610686418.0,965,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/kxndn4/i_walked_out_on_a_date_with_a_guy_over_covid/
What I wish I knew about men when I was young: wisdom from a middle-aged woman looking back.,"Here are the things I wish I'd known about men, love, and dating when I was starting out.  I really hope it finds the girls and women that it's meant for. If you struggle with self-esteem and being treated poorly in relationships, please read. This is not a screed against men. I love men. But if you spend too much time with the wrong ones, you will end up hating men. My wish is for every woman in a bad relationship to leave it. I would have recognized my own bad (abusive) relationship for what it was much sooner had I known some of these things to watch for in the beginning.

Also, this is about hetero relationships exclusively because that's all I've ever been in.

1) Every man has an idea of his ideal woman/dream girl and if you are not it, it's never going to work out. This is not about being super hot, perfect, or a 10 on some bullshit scale. It just means that every man has his ""type"" - curvy, nordic, freckly, waifish, dark haired, petite, plus, whatever. It doesn't matter. But they all have a type that they prefer for reasons *they* don't even know. You can be a stunning Swedish model but if his dream girl is Salma Hayek, then it's just not going to work. It's not you. In fact, we all have preferences but men put their preference at the very top of their list. Don't demean yourself by changing your appearance for some man to notice you. Look around for the ones that already notice you.

2) Men try their hardest at the beginning. If he is showing up unwashed and asking for sex on the first date it is already awful and will only get worse. A good man wants to impress you and will work to do so. Just think, if that guy got that date with Salma Hayek somehow, is he going to show up in dirty jeans, try to get her to split the bill, and then demand a blow job? Not a chance. Because he knows that she would walk away and he would have ruined his only opportunity to win her attention. You need to bring this same energy about yourself to every date. Your refusal to accept that type of nonsense works wonders for your self esteem. It also raises your standing in the eyes of good men. You are wasting your one precious life if you stick around for anything less. If you've ever been made to feel guilty about this, please think about the fact that he makes more money for the same job as you, does not spend $100s on makeup, hair, nails, clothes, what have you, to look as good as you do on that date, does not have to carry pepper spray and alert his friends of his whereabouts in case he goes missing, nor do they have to wrestle with the chance of getting pregnant every time they have sex. We all know that there is no 100% fool-proof BC out there, abortions are banned or threatened in many places, and you have no guarantee that this guy is good enough to stick around and raise a child with you. You have already paid, ten-fold, for the date. If he's asking you to do more, it's because you are not his ideal woman and he is trying to squeeze extra value out of you to make up for the fact that you don't have the boobs or face he prefers. Not because your boobs or face are bad, mind you, but because of his ingrained preferences. Oh well. Better to hit that eject button early and move on.

3) There are three types of relationships - a) you are both head over heels for each other; b) he loves you more than you love him; c) you love him more than he loves you. Relationships A and B can work, C never will. Why? Because men will only put in the work of a relationship if they are really crazy in love with you. Women will put in the work regardless. Relationships can't work unless both parties are putting in the work.  If you feel like you are working SO HARD on this relationship and he isn't matching the effort, you are in a C relationship. C your way out.

4) Women do the ""work"" of a relationship no matter where they fall on the spectrum of feelings towards their man. You can be in like with him ('he's nice') to fully head-over-heels in love with him ('I would have his babies today if he asked') and you will still do the work. What is the work? Remembering his likes and dislikes, listening to him and asking questions, compromising, doing things just because they make him smile and not because you get anything in particular out of it, making plans with him first before anyone else, considering him and his needs/desires when making plans with others (i.e. - he'll just be getting back in town that night from a long trip, I want to stay in and cook him a romantic dinner because I missed him instead of doing a girl's night). If this doesn't sound like work to you but just a regular relationship, that's because you are a woman and we do this automatically. Men will ONLY EVER put this work in for their ideal woman. If the relational work is not being reciprocated then you've got your red flags and are cleared for departure.

5) Most importantly, to a man, ANY WOMAN is better than NO WOMAN. Women bring immeasurable value to a man's life through our physical, emotional, intellectual, and sexual labor. Yes, it is all labor. They could pay separate people to cook, clean, manage, parent, and have sex with them OR they can have a girlfriend. Girlfriends are free and, for a lot of men, require very little relational upkeep. Have you ever found yourself in a relationship  with a man who seemingly despises you but chases after you whenever you try to leave? Or only gives the barest minimum but then a grand gesture to keep you when he senses you drifiting away? If that's the case then you are the ""any woman"" that he's keeping around until he finds THE woman. Don't be a placeholder in someone's life. This is your life. And you are pouring your energy and time into a bucket with a giant hole in the bottom. 

6) You will never find a good man by catering to men. A good man will find you when you are catering to yourself. Ultimately, this is your life and it is for you alone until and unless you find someone who actually makes it even better. It was never meant to be lived in devotion to another person. If you are functioning a lot in your relationship, drop the rope. Don't cook, clean, or caretake (ever, unless you love doing it) just because you are dating him. In fact, you will find out quite quickly where you stand if you stop supplying all of that extra labor. Your energy is meant to be spent on you - shower yourself with your money, delicious food, gorgeous home, extra time, whatever it may be that you create and generate. If he really wants you because you are his dream woman, you will know. He will work to earn your time and attention. It will be crystal clear that you are loved and adored. You will feel safe. You will feel heard. You will be fully yourself and cherished for it. You are worth all of this.

My husband was horrible during my labor. I still haven’t recovered from it. I don’t know if I can continue this marriage.,"First of all thank you anybody who reads this. I made this account but didn’t have the strength to post in the first time. I have a hard time getting anything done these days, I have severe postpartum depression. I am really sorry, English is not my first language so I apologize for the mistakes.

To the point: My husband who I thought I loved very much was a horrible, cruel, childish version of himself when I was in labor. I had a mean male nurse who was clearly the leading one of nurses I was almost afraid of and I specifically asked him to please not leave me, because I was afraid that if he is not there to support me the nurse will refuse to call the doctor and give me anesthesia enough early. It’s exactly what happened and I had to give birth without anesthesia. He told me he is tired and he had to go take a nap and eat something. Fine, but I couldn’t eat or sleep either. I was in pain giving birth to our child. Why do you leave me? Why wouldn’t you support me when you \_knew\_ I didn’t feel comfortable alone, speaking the language I don’t know perfectly, when everyone I love are on other country except you? Whole time when I was dilating he was complaining , snapping at me, asking pain meds from the nurses for himself…

What really hurt me was after the birth. I had a very difficult labor, very long and hard one. When I was laying there my pussy cut open up to my anus and being ripped apart from the vacuum he asked the doctor if when stiching me up they could make one “plus stitch” and made a gesture for vaginal tightness.  I was there, apparently not humiliated, tortured and tired enough, he had to let everyone know how my pussy is now ruined and it must be tighter. Maybe that I have never been tight enough for him. I’m there, destroyed, and he thinks of his dick. The female doctor looked at me, saw that I was crying again (I was crying on-off), looked at him and firmly said that she is going to act like she didn’t heard that inappropriate comment.

This happened in summer and I still don’t feel alright. My mother keeps telling me it’s my postpartum brain that is blowing everything out of proportion. I’m too ashamed to tell my friends who think everything is going great here. I feel like something broke inside of me that day. I don’t know if I love him or want to continue with him. We have fougth over and over, he has apologized a million times. Asks me, am I not allowed to have one bad day? I was tired too.

He has talked about another child. I can not give birth again with someone who left me feeling completely unsafe. He didn’t take care of me the one time I really needed someone to take care of me and when I was vulnerable.

I don’t have any friends here and I’m alone every day all day. I don’t want to divorce and do that to my son, at the same time I don’t want to continue this. I’m so miserable I’ve had horrible thoughts. I left everything to be with him in another country and now it’s ruined.

I feel like I’m trapped.

Edit: Hello everyone thank you very much for your help, I wish I had the time to reply everyone. Unfortunately I can't.  I have received lots and lots of good advice. Your kind words really warm your heart. Sometimes when you're alone in the dark, kind words, no matter if they are written on  a screen or said to you can light a little lamp that shows you part of the path.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on a game plan. I will try to contact facebook groups and ask if any one wants to be my friend. I will tell my own friends how bad I am doing. It's really hard but you just have to do it. I'm going to ask if I can use the car to have appointments with a doctor about my depression more often or go to therapist. I'm also thinking about writing a letter to my husband, telling everything. We haven spoken a million times, but maybe telling just how I felt, without ""attacking"" makes him understand me better.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. I wish everything gets better. I feel so hopeless somehow. Maybe there is a way. Every person who wrote me, I read you messages and it meant a lot to me.

EDIT 2: I haven't had the chance to start putting my game plan to action. I'm working on it.

I've received lots of support. I've read a lot of amazing PMs and messages, very touching, uplifting, kind, women and men telling their stories, some very heartbreaking stories. I would have never imagined in my life how many women have heard the stitch ""joke"", or the worst, most horrible thing, HAD the stitch done to them. I also received messages from women who had given birth in their husbands country, in a different culture, speaking a language they don't master properly and their husbands letting them down. It's hard to understand how deeply stressful it is if you haven't experienced it.

I've received lots of abuse. I don't care about that, so don't bother.

Now to the other type of messages: I am not asking if I am ""over reacting"" or ""blowing this out of proportion"" what comes to what happened that day. Me being depressed doesn't make me insane or so stupid that I am not able to make conclusions of my own experiences. I'm not asking if the most horrible, traumatizing painful experience of my life is valid or not. I am not asking if his behavior was acceptable or understanble. It wasn't. That's the end of it. What I am trying to figure out, is can you continue living with someone who has betrayed you. When you feel like you don't feel safe with your husband or that you can't trust him to be there for your in the hardest time, it's not something you can just forget. I still have nightmares of what happened. The experience was so terrifying I hallucinated.

About the stitch: apparently joking about the so called the stitch is so popular that it's a cliche. I didn't know that. Maybe that explains the wave of people shaming me for not taking a joke or how apparently ""the"" stitch joke is so popular it's a cliche.

It's the single most hurtful and disrespectful thing I've ever heard. I've received PMs that telling me that I am definitely not the only one feeling that way. It's vile and disrespectful.

**Adult men are not idiotic children that should be given pass to say things they saw ""in the movies"" as in they couldn't possible understand why it would be hurtful to their loved ones who are being  sewed up to stitch back her cut open and teared most intimate body parts. Men are not drooling idiots who are allowed to lack basic human empathy.**

These men telling me how they made the stitch joke too and to get over it,. Would they be so understanding if only their wives made a humiliating joke about the size of his penis in front of his friends? I doubt that. Now, what about if those same men read a Reddit post from a husband who told how abusive his wife was during an extremely painful surgery he was doing for her benefit too? I mean, most men would lose their minds having sharp objects approaching their genitals, but their balls being cut open in a way that they still couldn't take a painless shit or have painless, pleasurable sex after several months and their wife wanting to add unnecessary suffering to that for her sexual pleasure? That wife would be seen as a psycho, not some silly little girl.

The amount of people who are defending my husband's behavior stuns me. Somehow all the replies I've received are very eye opening. It stuns me how little some people expect from men, how much we expect from women and women aren't apparently allowed to express how horrible childbirth is. I have a hard time understanding the men telling me to ""put my big girl pants on"" since women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Yes we did, and dying in that process used to be a norm. If American culture thinks that the stitch joke is funny or acceptable, it's the culture that needs to change, not the women who feel it's horrible thing to say.

I'm ranting about the stitch, but whatever. I don't really have the energy to start explaining everything else, every little detail and opening up the situation. My mind is racing so much I feel a bit scared, but then again I've been nothing but unwell for so long I don't remember anything else, anyway I'm taking a little break from Reddit right now. I've received lots of good advice I am thinking on. After I leave this computer I will take action to make something out of this situation. First thing is to discuss the most important points with my husband. I'm calling my dad right now.",TwoXChromosomes,16784,1546089639.0,1742,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/aal5wl/my_husband_was_horrible_during_my_labor_i_still/
Dating a recently divorced man was a harrowing reminder that weaponized incompetence is the most dangerous tool that the patriarchy wields against women.,"I recently got out of a relationship with a man who was recently divorced, and his framing of the situation was an unfortunate window into the ways that men will shamelessly malign women to avoid facing their own shortcomings. 

To start, he claimed that their separation was due to the irreconcilable issue of his ex-wife never considering the ways in which *she* was in the wrong, such that he became the scapegoat for every issue in the relationship. He maintained this narrative over the span of 8 dates, claiming that the reason he couldn't see his son was because his ex was being petty and wanted to punish him.

After about two months of casually seeing each other — and of him strategically sprinkling in details that painted his ex as the toxic party — I visited his house for a weekend. For context, this was a trip that had been planned for about a week in advance, far from a surprise visit. When I walked in, I was shocked by the state of things. Months and months of moldy dishes were left undone in the sink, his bathroom had clearly not been cleaned in months, and dirty clothes were strewn all about the house. I stepped over some dirty diapers on my way to the bathroom, and slowly felt myself die inside. Did he truly expect me to comfortably stay there? For what was supposed to be a romantic weekend? Not wanting to be judgmental, and since  I was in an awkward position because I had committed to staying the night, I made an offhand comment about how life can get crazy quickly. I had already decided that we were not compatible based on the state of his house alone and my standards of cleanliness as a person. 

Imagine my horror when, to explain away the mess, he blamed it *all* on his ex-wife. He claimed that when she left, she carelessly sifted through for her belongings, which left the house in disorder. Except, she had left 8 months ago. *How did that explain the dirty dishes, the dirty laundry on the floor, and the unwashed sheets?* This was merely a snapshot of what his life looked like without a woman in it, and an affirmation of the ways in which he had manipulated me leading up to this moment of clarity.

As earlier mentioned, he claimed that his wife was *keeping* his son away from him. I later found out that it was because he kept promising her that he would clean his place and never did, which made it an unsafe environment for a one-year old. And how could a man who lived like this be trusted to care for a child? 

This whole situation was a stark wake-up call: men are so used to women picking up the slack for them that they'll victimize themselves at the expense of another woman's character — even the mother of their own child. It is a dangerous example of how their entitlement to a female-presence in their life  clouds their ability to self-reflect. 

So naturally is their inclination to blame women, that instead of getting his domicile in order to create the necessary conditions to nurture his infant son, he had spent months slandering the mother of his child to secure a new relationship without ever reflecting on what went wrong. What a nightmare!

Although this might be a more extreme example of manipulation, I can only imagine that a man like this won't change, but rather get better and better at twisting the narratives until some poor woman caves and believes him, setting herself up for a life of unpaid labor and the threat of being maligned just like her predecessor when she finally gets fed up. These kinds of men exist in every corner, and I can't help but imagine that this is the reality behind many ""dead bedroom"" situations. 

A woman can endure the difficulties of childbirth, be drained of their life force by having to parent emotionally stunted men, and it is still not enough — they are paid back in-kind by having their characters maligned to other women.

What is ever enough?

It's terrifying. ",TwoXChromosomes,3887,1711414372.0,393,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bnumvm/dating_a_recently_divorced_man_was_a_harrowing/
When rejecting a man can be dangerous,"When I was 20 I worked at a gas station in an area that had frequent armed robberies. It was meant to be a temporary gig until I found something better. I'm a petite woman &amp; my job had me closing the store by myself on Sunday nights. On those nights we closed at like 9pm or 10pm, so not super late but still after dark. 

I enjoyed the job but I always meant for it to be temporary because I knew the likeliness of me getting robbed was high. 

One Sunday night, while I was working alone, I was robbed at gunpoint by two males. I followed procedure, complied with their demands for the money in the two registers, locked the doors after they left, called 911, etc. Thankfully they didn't shoot &amp; it never became physical. The guys had their sweatshirt hoods up &amp; the ties pulled around their face so I really couldn't see who they were. 

2 weeks later I quit my job &amp; moved back to my home state. I actually had already planned on quitting &amp; moving when I did, I just hadn't told my boss yet so I used the robbery as my excuse for leaving. 

A year later, a police officer shows up at my door. The PD in the state I was robbed in called my local PD trying to find me. They had found the two guys who robbed me &amp; wanted me to go back to that state to testify against the one who wasn't cooperating. 

So they tell me who the guys are that robbed me. 

It was one guy who I guess came in often buying alcohol, he had came in but didn't have his ID with him, &amp; I guess I wouldn't sell to him saying I didn't recognize him. He was pissed &amp; that's why he wanted to rob me. 

The other guy -- was my coworker's son. This dude was younger than me &amp; he would ride his bicycle to my work often just to talk to me. I could tell he had a thing for me but I wasn't into him at all. Still, as women we're taught to be polite, so I was polite every time he came in to bother me. He was never rude or anything like that. But he told the police that he was upset that I wasn't into him &amp; that's why he wanted to rob me. 

I seriously can't even make this shit up. The dude thought it was a great idea to rob me at gunpoint at work because I didn't flirt back with him &amp; clearly didn't want to date him. 

So when guys tell us to stop being so dramatic when we get upset &amp; creeped out by men who constantly harass us, pursue us, &amp; just won't take no for an answer --This is why we get upset. This is why we get worried when men show these behaviors. This is why women everywhere are finally standing up against this type of behavior. 

We're not ""making a big deal out of nothing."" 
Because we can't tell the difference between the man who will eventually back off &amp; the man who will eventually get violent.",TwoXChromosomes,14171,1611808788.0,763,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/l6o5f5/when_rejecting_a_man_can_be_dangerous/
Last night highlighted the difference between flirting and creepy,"Posting this from a throwaway account:

I’m a young woman in my 20s, and I’m also an independent concert promoter (I don’t want to give too many details.) I hosted a show last night - a small one - and two different interactions during the night really highlighted the difference between appropriate and inappropriate behavior towards women, something that a lot of men have asked me questions about before and during the #metoo era.

First, I obviously knew the artists that I booked last night and most of the venue staff, but I didn’t know most of the attendees (which is actually pretty cool for a promoter!) My boyfriend didn’t come, simply because he was tired from work, so I came to and left the venue alone.

At the end of the show, a guy I didn’t know briefly stopped me and said “I just wanted to tell you that you’re really pretty.” I thanked him for the compliment and that was the end of that (I was in a hurry to settle up with the bands.) Why wasn’t this a problem? Because it wasn’t harassment, it wasn’t a sexual comment, he didn’t touch me or follow me around the venue, and he had no way of knowing I had a boyfriend (which I would have told him, had the conversation continued.) It was just a compliment!

A little bit later in the evening, after I’d settled up with the bands, we were all hanging out and chatting outside the venue when two guys joined us (they had arrived pretty late into the show.) Nobody knew them, but they seemed like nice guys, wanted to ask the bands questions about what it’s like to play shows and write music, wanted to ask me questions about what I do. Some of the comments turned flirty and I started to get uncomfortable with the way they were looking at me. I mentioned my boyfriend a couple of times (he’s also a musician and has performed with the headlining band on numerous occasions), but no matter how many times I made it clear I was in a relationship, they kept making comments along the lines of “you don’t have a boyfriend, right?”

At this point, all but the headlining band had left, and the two guys had sat down at the table with us - and they were REALLY, uncomfortably close to me, in a way that made it very difficult for me to get to the exit. I think one of the guys from the band realized what was going on, because he started talking about my boyfriend and what a great guy/performer he was (which clearly made the two guys feel awkward, since they couldn’t spend half of the conversation denying his existence). I wanted to leave at this point, but I was concerned about the possibility of them following me to my car (which has happened in situations like this before), and it was blocked in anyway.

At this point, my boyfriend called to make sure I was okay and ask if I was on my way home, and I told him I was trying to leave soon (obviously I didn’t tell him about the two guys, who were still right next to me). Immediately after I got off the phone, the band decided they were going to leave and started ushering the guys towards their merch table; this created enough of a distraction for me to bolt out of there before the guys noticed. I ended up having to hop a curb to get my car out of there.

Why did I react so differently to those guys than I did to the guy who called me pretty? Because these guys were repeatedly making comments that were clearly unwelcome, ignoring the fact that I was in a relationship, and stayed extremely close to me (the show was well over and it wasn’t crowded at that point - no reason to be that damn close.) The first guy made a nice comment and didn’t know I was unavailable. The other two guys became a potential threat when they repeatedly pressed the matter, ignored what I had to say, and stayed way closer to me than what’s socially acceptable. 

Tl;dr: Guys, if you’re going to make the first move, make one respectful “move” instead of an unreciprocated series (and give her some space, for fuck’s sake.)

EDIT: I’d like to thank the guys who sent me private messages telling me to go fuck myself for their interest in a post about how men and women can positively and respectfully interact. Calling me a man-hating millennial bitch shows that you definitely know more about respecting the opposite sex than I do, and your nuanced approach to this complicated subject is appreciated.

Also, to answer many people asking why I didn’t call them out on their behavior right then and there: partly because I just don’t like confrontation if I can help it, and partly because starting a big stink at your own event can be viewed as unprofessional, even if it’s arguably justified.",TwoXChromosomes,16132,1539270168.0,1756,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9naqeh/last_night_highlighted_the_difference_between/
It is so EXHAUSTING being a woman,"I'm sorry but I need to vent and I love that this is a safe space to do so.

This morning I woke up with a UTI. I visited my long distance boyfriend this weekend, and while I always pee after sex, I assume it is a result of being intimate and I just have bad luck. The pain became worse and worse as the day went on, a lot of crying and a lot of switching between screaming while on the toilet and trying to waddle around to keep moving since that lessens the pain.

I scheduled a virtual doctor's appointment because I didn't think I could drive myself to the clinic today and there was a pharmacy within walking distance. Great! It took about four minutes and I was able to walk to the store to get the prescription (and a pint of ice cream) and walk home.

Unfortunately, on the walk home, a man in a car slowed down next to me and called out to me: ""Hey. Hey you. Hey I'm talking to you. Why won't you look at me? Hey turn this way"". I ignored him and continued walking and once I was one house away from mine, I realized he. had. followed. me. the. entire. way. home. My house is the last on the street and I froze, realizing he now knew where I lived. My three roommates are away this entire week and so it is just me alone. I stopped in front of my neighbor's house trying to decided what to do, when my neighbor said a quick hello and only then did the man turn around and drive away.

I've locked everything and gone upstairs but wow. I'm so tired today. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of having to deal with biological shit like UTIs after having enjoyable sex. I'm tired of our bodies being in pain like this. I'm tried of men thinking it is OK to call out to me on the street. I'm tired of men thinking it is OK to follow me home. I'm tired of knowing there's a real fear that comes from men following me like this. I'm tired of feeling scared.

Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.

EDIT: I just wanted to express how grateful I am to everyone for their support and kind messages. My heart also goes out to everyone who commented saying they also have experienced UTI or bodily pain and/or feeling unsafe while outside alone. I am so sorry these things are so common, but I am here with you in solidarity.

"I just need to be sad right now. My kid is permanently, unequivocally, forever battling a medical condition. And it sucks.","And I don't know where else to share this. It's 11pm on Halloween night. My friends, family, and husband are all fast asleep. I'm laying beside my 7 year old daughter, cradling her as she survives through the chaos that is Type 1 Diabetes. She's snoring, but in between bouts of snores, she whimpers. About an hour ago, she cried out ""Why is this me?!"" then was right back to sleep.



I cry. For the first time since her diagnosis, I really really cry. You know the kind. Snot dripping down your face, big awkward gulps of air. Wailing.



Thank goodness she's a heavy sleeper.



She was just diagnosed in August. It's been 3 months. Only 3 months? And today, she ate a few extras candies (literally like 3 candies at school). Her blood sugar levels were high. Then we went trick or treating, and they got low. So we treated them with 15g of simple sugars - candy. We sat on the walking trail by our house while she laid down in her Joan of Arc costume. We waited. She came back up. My husband was ancy because our son was getting tired.  So we pushed through. We got to our friend's and she could barely stand. I gave her a piggy back ride and she said, ""You're the best mom ever. Like really, ever."" 



She struggled the whole way home. I tried to give her a piggy back ride again, but I was tired. She ninja rolled under our neighbour's fence to take the shortcut home. I met her there. 



And all night, she's had a horrific headache. Her stomach hurts. And she's weepy. Everything is the worst. My amazing, strong, fucking brilliant little mini-me is now wailing in pain because her stupid fucking pancreas has decided to stop making insulin. Fuck you, pancreas. 



She asks me to read to her. I do. Normally, it's one book, then 10 minutes of cuddles. Today, it's as many books as she wants. She asks me to keep reading as she falls asleep. I read Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, while admiring my own little rebel girl.



One who will now die if she doesn't have insulin. 



Everything changes so quickly. For the first time since her diagnosis, I long for the days when our biggest hurdle was her having temper tantrums and wetting the bed. 



Now she has a team of people who need to be her pancreas. 



She snores. She wails. She cries. Then, for the first time since her diagnosis, she throws up. 



Now, if you know anything about people with t1d, it's that they need carbs, along with insulin, to keep their numbers stable.



She just threw up all of her carbs. The carbs that keep her from having seizures, or falling into a coma.



Her numbers go lower.



I go to the kitchen to grab water, and by the time I'm back, she's fallen back asleep.



With as much love as forcefully possible, I manage to get her to eat a single bite of a banana. I have to wake her up to do so.



She throws up 20 minutes later. 
I give her a spoonful of honey. She manages to take it. For now. 



I call the ""pediatric endocrinologist"", because my child now has a fucking specialist doctor? And he says to keep the needles and syringes handy in case her numbers go low again. I start bawling as I try to give him my email address so he can send me explicit instructions on now to stick a needle into my kid. And now, I'm awake, checking her every hour. 



I have work in the morning. 



This is my life now. 



This is her life now.



I try to practice gratitude, but in this moment, it just sucks ass. She's one of the healthiest kids I've ever met. She eats cherry tomatoes as a snack. She loves avocados. She tries new things. She self reflects. She sleeps well. She is adaptable. She drinks water. We don't even keep juice in the house (at least, not until sugar became her medication, because what the fuck right?) She stands up for her friends at school. She does math for fun. She sings and imagines. She's honest. We're as close as a mom and daughter can be (in a healthy way).



So, I'm pretty sure that we're living in the twilight zone. Everything feels upside down.



I'm thankful that she has such a strong support network. But at this moment, I feel cripplingly alone. I feel like I need to remember this night, our first really hard night. Maybe it'll knock me out of my positivity and gratitude that seems to weird people out. Maybe it'll make me more cynical or resentful. 



But then I look at her, and my heart bursts with love. At least we're in this together, her and me. Because if anyone could fucking own this shit, it's her.



I'm pretty sure that she's my hero. 


I don't even really know what the point of sharing this is. To feel a little less alone, maybe.


I gotta go now. I gotta check to see if her blood sugars are stable. 



Thanks for listening.


Edit: Holy shit. I posted this around midnight my time, and was thankful if I had gotten a few words of encouragement and support. I did NOT expect to wake up this morning to so much solidarity. Thank you all, so so much. My daughter is an incredible person, and we keep our adaptability and enthusiasm as high as possible on most days. This is the darkest day I've ever had with it so far, I think because I had to have the specialized ""In Case of Emergency"" Glucagon needle ready. My usual response to people is, ""I'm just thankful that we live in the time and place that we're in"", and that if anyone is strong enough for this, it's my daughter. She's been relatively on target for the first 2.5 months, but the past couple of weeks have been wildly random, and it's been hard to understand why. We have it comparatively easy because she's incredibly healthy otherwise. She still has Halloween candy from last year! As a mother, I consciously focused on removing the shame and emotional attachment that my family history has to food (and body image, and self-care), and for the most part, my daughter has a great outlook on herself, her relationship with her body, and with how she takes care of it. It's made dealing with the diagnosis so much more manageable. She has an incredible support network, a great school, I have a great job, and we are all rallying around her. We are really fortunate. Thank you for letting me share my darkness with you all so that it didn't come out of me in her presence.

We try to see her t1d as ""you're not sick, it's just an extra thing you need to do to take care of yourself, like how we take showers and eat nutritious food and get good sleep. You can still do all the things, we just need to do these extra steps."" But last night was a ""yep, my kid is definitely sick beyond normal sick"" kind of night, and it slapped me in the face.


Many of you have asked about CGMs and Pumps - our work benefits are finicky, and our doctors advised not to consider these tools for at least six months ""so we know how to handle things without them"". FWIW, we're in Canada. It's been three months, and I feel like a CGM would allow us to actually establish consistent patterns and make informed choices, so we decided to go ahead and apply for the insurance coverage. We're now just in the limbo of waiting for approval and then getting set up (with a Dexcom G6). It takes time, but we're pushing towards it. As for pumps, we hadn't even really considered one because she had been on target so frequently. But if I can prevent another night like this (while still giving her the space to just BE A KID), then I'm all for it. I will be looking into it today.

Again, thank you all for everything. The private messages, the awards (what do I do with these? Thank you for making my daughter's story more visible!), the comments, the practical advice; even the insensitive comments are appreciated - it comes with the territory of putting yourself out there, and it's worth it. Thank you all for sharing your stories of living with t1d, or being a support of someone with t1d. It means so much to me. Our family stands on the shoulders of giants who have found solutions to the problems so that we can adapt easier. I will do my best to get back to everyone that I can, but even if I don't, know that I read every single message and have been crying like a baby.

Creepy dude won’t leave you alone? Barking helps,"So this happened on the weekend and I feel like sharing to this wonderful sub 

Went out for drinks with a few friends on the weekend. Got a little more dressed up than usual for once because F it, why not? I hardly ever do and it was fun to get ready with the girls. 

The night is over and I decide to walk home as where we ended up is very close to my home. I live in a big city, but the area wasn’t bad, it was busy, I wasn’t worried. 

I start walking and maybe 5 minutes in, as I’m crossing the street, some guy intercepts me as soon as I hit the sidewalk and wraps his arms around my waist, yanking me into him. I didn’t even see him coming. I yelled out WTF and pushed him back. This asshole is clearly drunk, grabs my arms and yanks me back in. Again, I push back and start backing up, telling him to not touch me again. He said something along the lines of “cmon, you can’t be out here lookin this fine and expect me to not say hi!” (Since when is grabbing strangers saying hi btw). 

He starts walking after me and I see him reaching for me again, so I just faced him and started barking, as loudly and aggressively as I can. Literally like a dog would. I don’t even know why I chose to, I just wanted to do something outrageous to make him back off and think I’m crazy or something.

It worked. The look on his face was priceless. He just turned around and walked away, it was awesome.

I unmatched with a guy from a dating app because alarm bells were ringing in my head and now I feel terrible,"I don’t know if it’s my anxiety or what. But he kept pushing to meet in person, alone. Even after I told him I wasn’t ready for that yet. It was like he was ignoring all the boundaries I tried to put up. He wanted me to hang out with just him after I was done with work today. Knowing I don’t drive and he’s have to pick me up. The pushiness made me sick to my stomach. So I unmatched and blocked him without saying anything. And I just feel awful about it. Even though my intuition told me to. I worried I hurt his feelings.

Edit: just wanted to say thank you to everyone reassuring me. I’m trying to respond as best I can but I’m working. I can’t thank you all enough for helping me. I’m glad I wasn’t the only one who saw the red flags.

Edit: thank you all for the awards. I agree with you all that it was super sketchy. At best I avoided being killed or sexually assaulted. At worst I ghosted someone who might’ve been a decent guy who was just eager to meet. Either way I’m glad I trusted my instincts.

Final edit: thank you all for your insight! I decided that I’m gonna take a break from the online dating world until I’m at a place where putting up boundaries doesn’t scare me. I’m going to be getting into therapy in October. And I bought the book everyone has been mentioning so I’m looking forward to reading it. Thank you all so much for your comfort.

Actual final edit: I followed the advice of some kind redditors and reported him. At the very least he’s on their radar and it starts a record if he does it to anyone else. It’s not much. And maybe a little overkill. But if it helps keep someone else safe so be it.

Update: the app got back to me about my report. He is *not* getting banned. However it looks like they’re keeping the report I made on record in case he does it to anyone else so they can ban him if it comes to that. I didn’t expect him to get banned. Let alone to get a response.",TwoXChromosomes,6480,1629908063.0,1032,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/pbehsp/i_unmatched_with_a_guy_from_a_dating_app_because/
We should not have to decide between standing up for ourselves or maintaining our own safety.,"So the other day I was around a trolley stop,  roller skating and minding my own business. I saw a random dude pointing at me which weirded me out, but I just kept my headphones in and ignored it.

After about half an hour I sit down to take a break, and the same guy points at me again and starts coming up to me. He's not wearing a mask and he's smoking, so I immediately asked him to step back. He starts getting defensive and said I was just tryna compliment you I wasn't even trying to get at you. I told him that I was uncomfortable when he was pointing at me and that I'm concerned about the pandemic we're in so I needed him to step back and put on his mask.

Just like that a flip switched; he starts yelling at me and calling me a bitch. Yelling that he wasn't even tryna get at me, that he was just tryna compliment me. And I said I already told you that I'm uncomfortable, so if you wanna compliment me do it in another way that doesn't make me uncomfortable.
He's like I wouldn't make a woman uncomfortable, I have a daughter. You just can't take a compliment bitch. And I said do you talk to your daughter like that? Then he starts getting HEATED.

At this point I got my hand on my pepper spray I'm ready to pull it. He starts walking up to me and is like don't f*ckin talk about my daughter you dumb bitch. You can't even take a compliment. I yelled right back and said I'm not obligated to take your compliment. Bye have a good day sir.

He starts calling me all sorts of names and yells all sorts of insults. I told him sir I don't care how you feel, I was minding my business and you came up to me. So you can leave now, goodbye. 
He was clearly hurt that I didn't take his compliment. Even as he walked away he was yelling at me and I was like why are you still talking to me??? BYE

When I came home I told my boyfriend what happened, and one of his first reactions was that I could've just ignored him and it probably would have been safer for me. I get where he was coming from but it kind of pissed me off; why should I have to sit there and take that bullshit in the name of safety? That creep was rude, entitled, and invaded my boundaries. I have every right to call him out and confront him. It is just so shitty that I should have to decide between catering to a man's ego for my own safety, or standing up for myself and putting myself in potential danger.


**Edit:** Wow, thanks for all the support y’all. This is my first post here and I didn’t expect to receive such a flood of responses. I'm filled with love and gratitude for everyone who's spoken up with support or shared their experiences. 

For some context; the incident happened in a well-lit area by a busy street, lots of people walking by. I'm a college student and the area I was in is a popular place for skaters to practice. I gauged my environment and made a decision on how I wanted to react, and I stand by it. You're welcome to disagree, but I made MY best judgement and I hope everyone reading takes some time to read through the replies to get a sense of how common my experience is for other women.

Regarding my boyfriend — I was pretty frustrated when I wrote this post, but I know what he said was in good intention. I think his reaction is common for a lot of people, because they instantly want to find a way to make sure you can avoid a situation like that in the future. Men in particular are conditioned to think that way because that’s the narrative they’ve always heard. We had a conversation about it and I explained why it was more important to me to feel validated in my feelings instead of being told what I could’ve done differently, which makes it feel like it was my fault I was harassed. He’s an amazing boyfriend and is open to learning; he understands that he has some ways to go so please stop bashing him lol. 

Lastly, remember that this is a subreddit to learn about different perspectives from self identified WOMEN so if you’re not here to listen or learn, you’re wasting your time. I’m grateful I can share this space with other powerful women and men who are open to learning so if you’re offended by anything I said, it takes less than 10 seconds to hit that “leave” button ❤️

To the guy who helped my niece tonight!,"My darling niece (18) went out tonight for a few drinks with her friends, it was her first night out without any aunties/sisters with her, she finally felt confident enough to do it.

After a few drinks and some laughs they went different ways home, 2 caught a taxi, my niece and her friends went to get the bus. Her friends bus left 10 minutes before hers usually arrived so she was happy enough to say goodbye and wait by herself, it wasn't even 10. She did her usual text to her mum and myself saying she was at the bus stop would text when on the bus.

While waiting 3 boys saw her and proceeded to chat her up. One of which moved her bag to the other side of him and blocked her from getting it. She had one on her right, one on her left and one blocking her in the front. They were trying to get her to go somewhere with them. Told her they knew a great place to get drinks, they would by them for her all night, even had a place for her to stay if she missed her bus. She told them no and asked nicely if they would leave her alone, they werent listening!

After a few minutes this lad comes up to them, takes her bag off the seat, grabs her hand and tells the boys thanks for looking after his lady and pulled her away from them.
Whole walking her down the street he tells her to walk normal, his names jake and he was going to get her home.
He asked what her name was, asked her if she could videocall someone on her phone for him.

She calls me, I answer and this sweet guy tells me his name, his age and why he was with her. He walks to his car opens the door for her then walks around his car showing my his number plate and any marks he has on his car. He also tells me to screen shot his face and his number plate.

He took her home, told her mum she was being harassed and he had to do something to help her. Anything could have happened to her but he made a decision to not let the happen. 

Thank you for showing her what a real man does, thank you for making her feel safe, thank you for making me see that some men are still raised right and thank you for asking her out on a date I'm hopeful it turns out to be as amazing as you seem to be!!

EDIT: For the people I offended by using 'real man', compared to the 3 boys who harassed her, made her uncomfortable, wouldn't leave her alone, suggested things to her, invaded her personal space, he is a real man. He made sure she was safe, he had a chance to take her out of a potentially dangerous situation and he took it. Real men help woman when they need to be helped, they don't use their size to intimidate woman, to try and pressure them. You are probably going to have a problem with this last statement but my niece is safe thats all that matters.",TwoXChromosomes,32404,1491350047.0,1352,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/63i0n9/to_the_guy_who_helped_my_niece_tonight/
UPDATE: I’ve realized I have lost all respect for willful ignorance and it may damage my marriage.,"Thank you to all who commented.

UPDATE: We had a serious discuss. I went into more details about my concerns and fears and it was… intense. I was much better at presenting the case. I gave him several hypotheticals that involved a particularly gruesome set of circumstances involving his ballsac ( 😬). I won’t bore you with the nitty gritty but the gist was to shift his perspective. I told him to seriously consider carrying a tiny fetus in his ball sac and the fact that the risk were things like Exploding Balls, Sepsis, etc and the myriad of ways he could end up dead, permanently physically injured and disfigured, or unable to produce a fetus in the future if he didn’t have the option of removing the fetus from his ballsac. I asked him if he would even want to take the risk and he agreed that he’d be very likely to remove it unless he was ready for those risks. I asked him why in the world would I be justified in telling him he HAS to carry it no matter what and it *might* only be removed after it starts to explode out of his ballsac or his organs start shutting down… etc.

 Once he seemed to start grasping the enormity of what abortion encompasses and seeing why it’s very important to not let unknown people control what options you have with no medical reason… I told him I lost a bit of respect for willful ignorance (and that I can tell he avoided thinking about it bc he knows in some way that it says something about his character) and I RESENTED having to even give him a hypothetical in the first place and that if he cares for me and our daughter that he should automatically actively be using his empathy skills every day. I explained how I have demonstrated the capacity to care about and evaluate gender issues he’s brought to my attention in the past. That was a… difficult part of the conversation. I also told him that I do not trust him to always make good decisions for us and that I feel alone in my shouldering of those responsibilities.

He listened and let me talk a lot. He asked if I was going to leave him and he was clearly nervous and bracing for the worst. I told him I’m not taking drastic steps like that but I certainly will when it comes to keeping our daughter healthy and safe. I also started to say something about how I know I would lie to him in a heart beat in a situation where our daughter needed an abortion or medical care and he interrupted me to say “You wouldn’t have to lie because I’ll be driving the car or buying the plane tickets and we will all go anywhe we need to”. Y’all, I burst into tears.

We ended the conversation and he said I laid a lot on him and he needed a break but says he has things to think about. I didn’t push anymore politics but I think I feel like my trust has been slightly restored. I’m not getting my hopes up but I think he realizes that he’s wading in dark and dangerous waters when it comes to our futures. 

ORIGINAL POST:

I (33F) and my husband (37M) were having a discussion about politics and we got onto the topic of our daughter (7F) which led to me expressing my fears about her rights and bodily autonomy. 

*For context, my husband votes Republican and I have always considered myself independent but recently have been shifting very far away from my younger “carefree” attitude toward politics. I love him very much and I know for a fact that he loves me but I have started finding his opinions naive and lacking depth. He is a very good man though and has in the past changed his mind on several things when confronted with them. FURTHER context: my cousin lives in a strict anti-abortion state and almost died a few years ago when the doctors waited until she was actively dying of sepsis before they decided it was okay to remove the dead baby from her body even though it had been dead for weeks beforehand (so needless to say I had a wake-up call and sharpened up my principles until they are very shiny and pointy)*

Last night when we were talking about abortion rights being healthcare, I lost my composure out of sheer terror about the possibility of a similar disaster with my cousin happening to our daughter and how I struggle to understand how he doesn’t see the problem with his party and that in fact I think he is being willfully ignorant to the danger I and my daughter face in favor of his idea about making economics work for our family. I also said that if our daughter dies due to something preventable, like the ability to get a timely and much needed abortion or gets shot to death in school that I would let my own mother rot in a nursing home (she votes R too) and I’d never be able to look him in the face again which would basically be me disappearing and divorcing him.

I was crying and upset and explaining how scared I am and he asked me in a very hurt manner if I’d actually abandon him like that and I am truthful to a fault and said that I would, perhaps out of a sense of illogical grief and betrayal, because I’d know my concerns were not taken seriously and that they had abandoned common sense and did nothing to attempt preventing a very real consequence of voting away mine and my daughter’s right to healthcare. I equated it to a slow motion car wreck with our daughter in mortal danger and him just watching it happen bc it doesn’t involve his own body.

I know he needs to hear it. But I think I was too raw and open about it to steer the conversation in a healthy way and I have a very blunt manner. I apologized this morning for saying that I’d leave him, even though I know I would, and he tentatively accepted it. And I said we’d talk about things later when I can articulate things in a healthier way. But I’m at a loss as to how to make it known how deadly serious this is to me and not make him feel like I’d abandon our marriage over just any sensitive topic.

I do not need people telling me to leave him. I don’t think I know how to make it anymore digestible and be clear without going nuclear over something that has not happened as our daughter is too young to suffer that yet. The rub is that I am the person who is changing the dynamic of our relationship. And I am beginning to understand how politics breaks up families.",TwoXChromosomes,2898,1720798564.0,360,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1e1knlo/update_ive_realized_i_have_lost_all_respect_for/
To the girl that I followed today for almost four blocks to her car,"We were walking in oposite directions near the new studient accomodations, you briefly looked at me and kept walking and a couple of seconds later I turned around and started following you, I notice the moment you realised that I was following you by how your pace changed, your shoulders squared and you grabbed your phone. That didn't stopped me, you just kept walking and I maintained the distance (some 50 feet behind you) pretending to talk on my phone, I thought a couple of times on closing the distance and introduce myself, talk to you, but I didn't, so you kept walking, throuwing glances to check where I was. I could also tell you that once you turned around the corner to the dead end street next to the motorway (the only one near the city centre were parking is not measured) were your car (and mine) was parked that if you had being wearing tennis shoes you would probably have started to run, but wisely you kept you pace in your high heel boots. I stopped by my car, yours was further down the street, and used my phone again, and I saw you taking a picture or video of my when you passed by my side in your car.

What you probably never noticed was the other two guys, the ones in the other sidewalk, the ones that pointed at you and started to follow you before we crossed the first time, you didn't notice how they looked at you or the fact that they seemed to be on drugs, or a bit drunk, or maybe both. You also didn't notice when you passed me in your car that they were in the corner of the dead end street, looking at you in your car passing by and then at me. You also missed the next ten minutes while I waited in my car for the police to arrive (that I called while you were getting into your car), the 15 minutes of questions that followed and me showing them the picture of the two guys that I took while I was following you.

I really sorry that I scared you, but to be completely honest, I was really scared myself, I'm no hero by any means and my instinct was telling me to get the f\*\*\* out of there, but you could have been my wife (she parks in the same street) or my daughter and I wouldn't fogived myself I something happened and I did nothing to stopped it.

(Belfast, 14 Nov 18, 4pm)

&amp;#x200B;

Edited to clarify a couple of things:

1 I shared this because the situation scared me, and if a similar situation happened somewhere else I wish that the situation is not ignored or shrugged off. Do I have any advice? Dunno, probably just this: if you think that you are being followed or that something is wrong, don’t wait to see what happen, call the police, call a friend, a family member, knock on a door or get into a shop, worst case scenario you’ll look a bit paranoid.

2 She was carrying some sort of briefcase alongside her purse and was well dressed, I think that the briefcase was what called those guys attention .

3 They seemed to be waiting for an opportunity, that was the main reason why I didn’t approached, I was afraid that I would sort of trigger them and offer a second target (still, probably wrong on my side, but in the moment that's what I thought).

4 I called the police because if those guys were trying to assault her, more than likely it wasn’t the first time and / or they would go for another victim, if it was a mistake worst case scenario they spent 10 mins talking to the police (no idea if they caught them).

5 I parked my car in the dead end street and was walking towards the city centre, she was coming from the city centre, obviously I didn’t know where she was heading, if instead of turning to the dead end street she had continued walking I would had probably approach her, or she would had reach another street that has more traffic and there are more people walking around.

For the ones wanting to know where this happened:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Final EDIT:

1 For some reason I can't see any new replies from the last 8 or 9 hours, I have seen some of them in the notification's bar in my phone but not all the text is showed and I can't reply from there (and I wanted to reply to some of them) and this is the reason for a final edit.

2 To the people that think this is BS: I whish it was, you don't have to believe me and in fact I don mind, just do yourself a favor and be safe out there (regardless of your gender)

3 I think that someone asked for the police report: REALLY??? Do you expect from me to upload a document with my personal information just so you can ""believe me""?

4 To clarify what happened: I saw the two guys gesturing only a couple of seconds before I crossed the girl and I kept walking a bit trying to decide what to do (turn around?, keep walking?, shout at her?, shout at them?) I deceided to follow her just in case, I didn't know what the guys intentions were (if any) or even if they knew her, but the constant glances at her and finaly the fact that they stayed in the corner (entrance) to the dead end street and the way they looked at her when she passed by in her car was what made me call the police (also, don't forget that I was in that same f\*\*\*\* street and to go back to the city centre I would have had to walk by them).

4.1 Adendum: Northern Ireland is part of te UK, not ROI (Republic Of Ireland) and here we call the police ""the police""

5 Was my decision the best one? most likely not, but it's what I did and no one was hurt (beyond being scared, that is). Now that it passed and reviewing the situation (alongside with some of the comments here) if anything similar happens again I would try to approach the person and explain the situation, or even maybe call the cops straight away.

To the man on the other side of the street...,"Throwaway because people know my actual reddit account~

Last night I was at the club, and all my friends left early to go home and rest. When I was walking out to my car, I passed a couple men who made some disgusting comments on my body. This wasn't unusual, but this time some of them turned around and started following me. They kept calling me names, and eventually one of them slapped my ass. I ignored this, and kept walking to my car. Eventually one of them grabbed my arm and said something like, ""Hey, wanna come with us?"" I got scared and started running to my car, and that's when the man on the other side of the street saw me. He ran up and said, ""Hey babe"". I was a little scared and confused so I didn't respond, but he quickly followed up by asking the group of guys what they were doing, and to ""fuck off."" He escorted me to my car, made sure I was safe, then left and I never saw him again.

"A man tried to scare me and I did something unsafe, but it was so satisfying.","I live in a big city with crowded sidewalks and walkways. Typically people stay to their right and form two lanes walking in each directions.

On 3-4 separate occasions, typically at night or when the streets are less crowded, a man will go out of his way to walk in the opposite lane and bump into me. They typically stare you down, willing you to move aside for them, and walk straight through you.

I grew up with a dad who loved power plays like that. I always hold my ground, walk on the right side of the sidewalk as I normally would, and brace myself as well as I can when he drives his shoulder into mine ... but I'm 5'5"" and not any physical force to be reckoned with. 

Yesterday I was walking home from work, carrying a huge ceramic plant pot that my coworker gifted me. I'm walking alone on the sidewalk, and a man is walking towards me.

He is staring at me and I watch him switch over to the other side of the sidewalk, directly in my path. There are no stores or anything around. He was moving over to scare me into stepping aside for him. 

As he approaches, he continues staring me down. I know its possible he was going to mug or assault me when he made contact, and I know what I did next was unsafe, but I could see this coming and it made me *angry.* 

He crashes into me, trying to walk through me, and I smashed the lip of that giant ceramic pot right into his breastbone with as much force as I could manage.

I heard the wind knock out of him. Now this man could feel what its like to be on *my* end of this sort of intimidation tactic.

He screamed obscenities and I took that moment to get my mace out, in case he attacked as I walked off.

I know it was unsafe, but I'm glad at least one man learned his lesson about pushing women around.",TwoXChromosomes,6033,1691074003.0,324,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/15h69bi/a_man_tried_to_scare_me_and_i_did_something/
Why is it so hard to believe women suffer from pain?,"I just got back from a wasted hour of my life with my partner, trying to explain to a physical medicine doctor that her searing, burning, tingling and painful sensations through the right side of her body is not a ""psychosocial event"". It is very real. I have watched her suffering for over a month with doctor after doctor shoving it off on a different specialist every time we're in. We're the problem patients that keep going to different specialists and I cannot for the life of me understand why no one will believe us.

It's real. I see it every day. I see her loss of neuromuscular function. I see that a month ago we were hiking and mountain biking and camping and she's in so much pain now that she can't even walk a mile. And the best this doctor can do is acquiesce to a single xray, that we begged for, because even with the recommendation of a physical therapist who clearly sees the deficiencies in mobility, this is a ""psychosocial event"". This is all in her head. It's insulting, and infuriating and exhausting. I cannot for the life of me understand how neuropathy does not equate at the very least to imaging to rule out a mechanical injury. But you're a woman and an athlete who spends time analyzing the movement patterns of other athletes. So you made it up because your saw it in other people, and it's in your head, and nothing is actually wrong with you, despite previous MRIs showing abnormality of the spine before that doctor sent us off to this one. What the ever living fuck is wrong with the healthcare system, and how the fuck do we fix this, because this is absolutely untenable.

And doctors have the audacity to wonder why there are so many anti vaxxers, so many alternative medicine practitioners, so many people denying the very real benefits of medical science. Because MDs did this to themselves. They trivialize and downplay and waffle about the ""nocebo effect"" and dehumanize the individual to the point that if someone, anyone is willing to actually LISTEN, it doesn't matter if that person is an MD or a functional medicine practitioner. If you won't hear about people's very real problems, don't be shocked when they turn away and seek out alternative medicine that will. I don't for a second believe in alternative medicine but I am starting to understand why so many others do, and I can't blame them for a second.

EDIT: holy shit y'all. Honestly I just posted last night because I was tired, and scared, and had nowhere else to turn except the internet to vent out just a fraction of this never ending anxiety and pain and you all turned up for real. I don't even have the words for how your support and stories have made us not feel so alone in the world right now and I am so sorry that this resonates so deeply with so many of you.

A couple things. 1) we've got a neuro who is willing to work with us and whom I have faith will refer us once his diagnostics are done and if they come back as something he does not specialize in, as he only works with a small portion of seizure disorders, and we don't really fall into that category at this time.

2) To the doctors coming out - I get it. I hold that this is one bad MD who did not ethically treat her patient to the best standard of care possible. A huge part of my frustration is that this likely an incredibly complex issue spanning multiple disciplines and involving multiple parts of her body failing to work properly. The way medicine is fragmented into micro specialities is making this almost impossible to work through, since no one is forming the big picture and only focusing on their area of expertise. Which is fair and also hella frustrating beyond belief. Healthcare didn't have to be like this. American healthcare in particular is its own form of dystopian hell and it's not the fault of individual practitioners in the system. 

Except for this doctor. Who said that small, petite women often have inhibited movement and some pain in the right arm because of their size. That's...that's a bad doctor, guys. What the fuck is that even. Congratulations on your dad owning a wing in a hospital somewhere, because honest to god that's the only way I can justify her graduating medical school. 

3) Just...thank you guys. We're both terrified that this will not ever be properly addressed and she's going to spend the rest of her life slowly losing the physicality that defined her since her days as a competitive cyclist. I appreciate the stories of hope and I identify with the stories of continued failures.

I just wanted to get a bagel,"So around 10AM this morning, I shuffled out of my apartment to go grab some breakfast a few blocks away. I got to my spot, got my food, and started to mindlessly meander back home when I heard a woman shout, ""no, leave me alone.""

I snapped out of my daze and saw a woman who was being accosted and followed way too closely by some man. When her and I made eye contact I could see the fear. I did what I always do in these situations - swiftly got right inbetween them and got right up in the dudes face.


Here's the thing. I'm a 6'2 trans woman (and busty, and I think kinda hot - visually, I stand out, is what I'm trying to say.)  I personally hate my height, but it is a double-edged sword. It no doubt works for me and against me in all sorts of ways. This was one of a handful of times I've had to be confrontational to defend another woman being harassed and being tall helps. Also, this guy was like 5' nothing, (but still taller than her). I could have DESTROYED him.

So I got up in this guys face, which looks hilarious cause he barely reaches my tits. I just loomed over him and was like, ""you're not talking to her anymore, now you're talking to me."" I wasnt trying to out myself or anything but but my voice did drop a little. He was definitely caught off guard by the very sudden and unexpected circumstance he was in. I then tried to Chris Hansen him a little.

""What's your name?""

""Jon.""

""Here's the problem, Jon. Its 10AM, and you REEK of alcohol and cigarettes. It's a bad look, Jon. Very bad.""

""You should be worried about her instead!""

""She's fine, but you're not. You need to turn around right now, Jon, and go. Now.""


He turned around and fucked off. While we were chatting the woman must have made her escape cause I couldn't find her anywhere. So I crossed the street and continued home. When I crossed there was a second guy, looked older than who I just dealt with. He was watching over the situation. You know, surveying. Keeping the peace. Being helpful in a tense situation. He gave me a thumbs up.

"My husband feels ""bombarded""... and I am so tired.","I just need to vent to people that might hear me for once.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband leaves for work at 7:30a and gets home at 6p. We have a 14 month old son who just started daycare. I work from home full time (and am the breadwinner), but my job is very demanding. I walk my son to daycare (.3 miles from home) each morning when my husband leaves for work, and I pick him up at 4p. His bedtime is 6p, and he has been so tired from daycare that I have not been able to push him much past that so that my husband can spend time with him at the end of the day. It sucks, but our son's sleep is the most important.

&amp;#x200B;

We are all currently sick (again, just started daycare and we all immediately got a cold). Yesterday, my husband called me at 5p while I was feeding my son dinner to tell me he was coming home early, it is a 30 minute drive. I said great, see you soon. Every night, I feed my son dinner at 5p and then we go upstairs for a bath and bedtime after dinner. My son was especially tired, and about 5:15p started getting really fussy. I took him outside to walk around with me a bit while we waited for his dad to get home. Dad gets home at 5:30p, we greet him, we are happy to see him. We go inside and I tell them I got them coats and such from Costco today, whatever. Our son is so exhausted, he bumps his nose on the floor and gets a nose bleed. I pick him up and ask my husband ""do you want to give him a bath while I start dinner?"" His response is ""I feel bombarded. I came home early because I do not feel good. I got light headed today at work."" I say ""Ok, then I will give him a bath."" Honestly, rather short but direct, our son needs a bath right now so I will just do it. He then starts following me saying he will give him a bath! But honestly, I do not want my husband caring for my son when he is in a bad mood. He has a very short temper and our son is 14 months, he tests A LOT of boundaries. I undress our son and start drawing the bath. My husband is standing in the doorway and says ""I just need to chug water and I will give him a bath."" I say OK. He then apparently went and chugged water, I did not see him leave because I had our son in the bath and I was trying to get his hair washed before his father took over. (Son doesn't like getting his hair washed and I didn't want it to result in my husband being short with him after such a long day) He then says ""do you want me to go start dinner....?"" I say ""Sure, that would be great. If you don't mind that would be really helpful."" He says ""I came home early to spend time with my son so I would like to give him a bath"" and I say ""Ok, great. I will go start dinner then."" I then start dinner, he bathes our son and calls for me to take him out and then he gets into the shower while I dry and dress our son and put him to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

When we go downstairs, he says ""I am sorry I didn't like the jacket you got me, I appreciate your thought --"" And I kind of cut him off and say ""I appreciate that, but I am not upset about that. I will return it, no big deal. I am upset you said you felt bombarded when I asked if you wanted to give our son a bath."" We then argue because he says this is him expressing his feelings and me ""blowing up"" at him about it. Would it kill him to just say ""Hey, I am sorry I just need a minute because I had a really long day"" or ""I would love to give him a bath, but I just need a few minutes to unwind"" or ANYTHING. Aside from telling me I am bombarding him? For asking him one question? And like what, did you think you were going to come home at 5:30 and just relax? Knowing it is bath and bedtime?

&amp;#x200B;

I am so exhausted. I even apologized for being passive aggressive, owned that I was upset and didn't think I could respond to him following me saying ""I will give him a bath"" without snapping. And all he wants to do is beat a dead horse. As though 100% of the issue that evening was me not responding after I get told I am bombarding him for asking literally ONE question (No, he doesn't know the definition of bombarding clearly). I get ""I am sorry for saying that but I don't think it's something I should have to apologize for because I was just saying how I felt."" Like, that isn't an apology? Might as well just say you don't care about my feelings. Which, fun fact, he doesn't. At all.

I am tired. I am so tired.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Wow. Thank you for all the responses. I didn't think this would get as much traction as it did. A lot of you took the time to formulate really thoughtful responses and I am taking those to heart. I have called a couple's counselor and am working on getting us into therapy.

To address a few things that were repeatedly asked/called out in the comments:

\- I do not believe my husband would ever hurt me or my son. That being said, he can be short. He does say things without thinking that I do think my son will someday very soon hear and potentially internalize. I have spoken to him about this and plan to try and address it more directly in therapy. (The example: I usually get up and grab my son when he wakes up but I was in the shower, so he did this one morning. My son was grumpy and my husband said ""I get it I shouldn't have even come to get you, I ruined your whole day!"" That just doesn't sit right with me. I am overprotective about his emotional negligence because his dad is literally an evil man who emotionally abused my husband his entire life.

\- My husband was a stay at home dad until 5 weeks ago. His work pays for daycare and our family's insurance. I pay for the mortgage, groceries and all bills. The reason I made the breadwinner comment and felt it was relevant is because I am currently sensitive to a situation. We got into a fight over the weekend because when he was a stay at home dad, I expected him to feed our son lunch and also clean up after it. This was when our son took (2) two hour naps a day. Before daycare started, I had our son home for five days over two weeks completely by myself, while also working. I fed him breakfast, lunch and dinner. He bitched at me about not having dinner cleaned up when he got home. (BTW - I also had dinner cooked for us.) I explained I feed him dinner at 5, then bathe and bedtime, he gets home at 6 and I haven't even been back downstairs yet. He said this is a double standard because when he was a stay at home dad I expected him to clean up after his lunch. I told him this is not a double standard because I am not a stay at home parent, I am a full time, working parent who is juggling taking care of our son while working a demanding WFH job. He will DIE on this hill that this is a double standard. He says that by me saying it is apples and oranges (which it is!) that I am insulting him as a stay at home parent and saying it is easy (???). That is not what I am saying but I am doing literally the same thing AND MORE (because I worked part time in the office, was always there for breakfast, only missed dinner (3) times in eight months) because I also have a full time job. He is refusing to acknowledge this. I explained he should be happy to clean up dinner because it can be a way he contributes towards our son's care for the day while I care for him while he is at work. He is SO ANGRY about this he packed a bag and threatened divorce. He has still not apologized. It has put me in a place that I feel very used, unappreciated, disregarded. I can't shake it.

\- I have spoken to a couple's counselor and we will go to find better ways to communicate because we are both terrible at it.

\- I do not need this man. I love him so much, but I will be fine without him caring for our son. If he is unwilling to accept any responsibility towards his anger (Which he has not. Every fight he tells me I am 100% of the problem and he is none. He tells me couple's therapy isn't fair because then he has to go even though he isn't part of the problem) then I will be divorcing him and hopefully find a way to amicably co-parent. I will not be staying in this relationship long enough for it to emotionally damage my son. NOTHING is more important to me than my son's physical and emotional safety.

Thank you again to everyone who took the time to share their experiences and advice. I feel much less alone than I did this morning. &lt;3 ",TwoXChromosomes,2962,1698336275.0,564,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17gzv7l/my_husband_feels_bombarded_and_i_am_so_tired/
I found the secret to not getting cat called!,"It’s overalls! And not just any overalls, the overly cutesy ones that a 6 year old would be jealous of. 

I like being cool in the summer. I like wearing shorts + tank tops or crop tops. Or dresses. But every year it’s like the crazies emerge and I’m constantly being followed, harassed, yelled at, or having weirdos come up to me. 

The final straw for me was two years ago, I was shopping with my four year old. I was wearing shorts and a tank top. I had no makeup on. We were out in the parking lot garden center, and this man drove up with his door within inches of me and my child. He wanted my “autograph” and my number and got shitty when I said no. 

I felt uncomfortable so we went inside. Where not *ten minutes* later, a guy old enough to be my father walked up to us and graphically described what he wanted to do to my body *in front of my kid.* I decided I was going to try to make sure my husband was with me when I went out. 

Last year my husband told me he loved overalls on me. I’m not gonna lie; I don’t prefer them. But I love him so I bought a pair of pink overalls with strawberries on them. They’re actually really comfy, so this year I decided to wear them more. 

I wore them to the store alone. And I did keep getting approached, but always by women! They’d tell me how cute they were! So I decided to try something new. I bought 3 more pairs of pink overalls with patterns. I wear them every time I go out. 

Men have stopped cat calling me. Women continue to be nice. I think overalls have saved my sanity and my freedom. My daughter continues to be jealous of my cool overalls, but she doesn’t know that I bought her several pairs for her birthday.

I'm 15M. Is this sexual harassment? How to make them stop? How can I talk to her mom/her about this?,"Hopefully this is the right place to post this. My friends and I consist of about 6 (all 15-16 yr olds), along with my twin. We've literally grew up together as we live in the same neighborhood and have for all our lives. All of our parents are friends and we go on trips and such together often. They're like brothers to me, and while we're all stupid teenage boys, they've never done anything too wrong or questionable. Until now

There is this very attractive girl who has just moved into our neighborhood about a month ago. She's 17, so she's not that much older than us, but she is one of the only girls around our age in the neighborhood. Instantly she got our attention, and while I did attempt to flirt with her at first, when she told me she wasn't really interested I left her alone. The rest of my friends weren't so dismissive, and I'm pretty sure they've been harassing her now.

They'll wait for her to come home from her cheer-leading practice, and then whistle at her, and take pictures of her in her uniform. Whenever she walks her dog they'll follow her around trying to talk to her, even after she tells them to leave her alone. Yesterday, they actually grabbed her and tried to force her to hug them, but at that point my brother and I pushed them away from her. She went home and after that they started calling us ""white knights"", and ""cock blockers"". They said they were just having fun and she probably likes the attention.

I really don't think they're going to leave her alone, and to be completely honest we've never had any problems between us before. They mean everything to me but how else are you suppose to tell someone close to you that they're acting fucked up without cursing them out or losing them. If I go and talk to the girl or her mother what should I say?",TwoXChromosomes,12709,1504715433.0,1416,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6ygplk/im_15m_is_this_sexual_harassment_how_to_make_them/
My friend got followed on her way home last night and confronted the guy,"I'm shaking, I cried already because this just terrifies me

Last night my friend and I were at an event of our school (covid safe), and ended up chilling a bit longer with the rest of our group until we both felt a bit tired and decided maybe we should head home. At that moment the group we were with invited us to go along to someone's house and I ended up deciding I wanted to go with them.

She said she would walk home, 20 minutes from where we were. I asked her to stay, then asked the group which way we would go so she didn't have to walk alone long. But we had to go the opposite way and she said she'd be alright. We hugged, promised to see each other the next day, she said she'd call me if she got some trouble. We had both forgotten my phone had died.

Later that night when I charged my phone I got a notification that she had tried to call me and my heart just sunk. Then I got a snapchat where she was in her room, saying she had been stalked on her way by a guy.

When she left us after a while she got on a main walkway across our city that is usually safe at night. Right away when he started following her she noticed. She stopped walking so he could pass her and he turned into a side street further away. She kept waiting, and eventually this guy came out of the street, and walked ahead of her, so she started walking as well thinking he just got lost. Then he turns into a street again, she feels suspicious, tries to call me, my phone dead so she calls another girl friend. She tells her she feels like she is followed, asks how she should proceed because she doesn't want him to see where she lives and maybe come into the apartment hallway with her. After some courage and just before her apartment street she stops, and waits. This guy passes the corner. He stops to look at her. She stares him down, and then tells him to keep walking. Keep walking, Keep walking.The guy asks her what's the problem, he just wants to talk to her.She tells him the problem is he obviously been following her, to leave her alone, she got somebody on the phone.He says he wasn't going to do anything, the shops were closed and it's late, he wanted to talk to somebody.She kept firmly telling him she wasn't interested, it's creepy, keep walking, I want to see you walk in front of me.He's stubborn, doesn't want to go,Frustrated as fuck, she tells him she doesn't want him to see where she is going,He says he doesn't need to go the way she is going, (like he hasn't been following her for a while), that it doesn't matter where he is going. It goes back and forth for a bit longer and he says I'm staying here.She tells him to then stay the fuck there and not to follow her anymore, and decides to keep walking, making sure he isn't following, loudly speaking on the phone.

She was shaking when she got inside, mad and freaked out. THIS ISN'T FUCKING NORMAL. I'm already prepared for men who lurk this subreddit for cheap shots at women to say she should have at least spoken to him a bit, he was probably lonely, he wasn't following her, it's a main street everyone could walk there.WE DO NOT OWE MEN WHO STALK US AND FOLLOW US ANY OF OUR TIME. WE ARE ALLOWED TO WALK DOWN THE STREET. LESBIANS DO NOT STALK WOMEN HOME, THEY DO NOT OGGLE AT US WITH THEIR EYES AND YELL HOW THEY WISH TO FUCK US ON THE STREET WHEN WE PASS, WHY CAN'T MEN DO THE SAME.

And then let's say this guy really was a nice guy, which he wasn't, he lacked the basic awareness that women do not feel safe when a guy walks behind them suspiciously. He didn't think how his actions affected her. If he really just wanted to talk, why wasn't he just a friendly face, that said good evening instead of creepily following her.  Then men say, we don't want to adapt our actions for the small possibility of your discomfort. Guess what, women adapt their actions all the time based on the men or the idea of men in their immediate surroundings. We walk on main streets and avoid side ones and alleys, we avoid or try to avoid to walk alone, we text our friends when we got home and tell them to call us to say they are, we surpress the way we really want to dress so that we aren't oggled at, and even if we did dress more ""provocatively"" that isn't an excuse to be mistreated. ""But women like compliments from other women, why can't I say anything?"" is what is asked then. Because women usually don't only see us as a potential sex opportunity. We know women see us as potential friends, they see us as beings not for their own gratification. That's why. I have yet to meet a women, *or a girl* who hasn't been sexually harrassed by men and boys.

Tonight, I have decided I will not let any of my girlfriends walk alone for a while. This man's actions, for some would seem not that agressive, not violent, why all this drama for a stalker right? But this shit goes deep. Because we as women, have been trained on all these stories in the news and over the passage of history that men rape women, all the time, everywhere, whenever they do and do not suspect it, it doesn't matter in daylight or at night, if she was modestly dressed or not, the only similar factor is that it was a man.

I'm tired, I feel incredibly guilty, I'm going to hug her tight later today

&amp;#x200B;

edit: UPDATE; I saw her today and did hug her tight, she is feeling alright. She explained things more in detail;Apparantly she also told him he made her uncomfortable, and he asked her why she thought that,""Because you followed me for 10 minutes!"" She yelled, and she told me she saw that he was genuingly confused that he had made her uncomfortable. Same for when she told him she was on the phone with someone because of him.

She told me that the moment she had started confronting him, she felt herself in power of the situation and not so scared anymore. She hopes that maybe this interaction will make the weels in his head spin a bit and develop some introspection in his attitude towards women.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: This is in Europe, so we don't carry guns or have gun ranges. Women shouldn't have to carry guns for men to finally leave them alone. Pepper spray is illegal here. Car serviced to bring women places is nice and all but that is not what I'm pleading for. I'm pleading for us to be able to fucking live our lives without men trying to fucking bother us.  Teach men not to see women as objects. By telling women how they can prevent this you are putting the blame in their court.

You just don't know until it happens to you,"In February, I (32 f) was at a gas station after work and saw a guy knock his girlfriend out. He did it in front of everyone at a busy gas station in Baltimore.

Without thinking, I jumped out of my car and screamed at the guy to get the fuck away from her unconscious body. He immediately tried to pick her up and apologize, but when I started to call the cops, he swung at me. Grazed my jaw.

I got in my car and locked the doors. I tried to take video, but I couldn't while on the phone with the police. So I took as many pictures as I could.

This man dragged her body to his car, shook her awake, and made her come and tell me to stop calling the cops. I didn't. So, then, he tried to break into my passenger side door. I backed up to leave, so then he sat on the hood of my car. I managed to drive off without running him over (despite the desire).

Shocking, yes? But, wait, there's more. The majority of my call with 911 during the incident was arguing whether I was in Baltimore City or County. I lived in that neighborhood and knew it was in the city. Still, she transferred me to the county dispatch.

County police arrived and said it was city. But was able to pull his license plate info to help me identify him. After about an hour, the city police arrived, took a report, told me that I need to file charges, and said he will check out the surveillance footage.

I assumed that the state would pursue this incident automatically. I assumed my photos and the surveillance footage would be enough for the state to file charges related to assaulting his girlfriend, assaulting me, trying to break into my car, trying to intimidate me, etc. I assumed the evidence would be damning that I wouldn't have to do anything else. I assumed wrong.

I had to file an assault charge. Me. I had to show up to court as the plaintiff. Me. I had to bring up to the prosecutor the fact that he was already on probation/parole for a previous assault charge. Me. I had take 3 days off work for the district court hearing, the initial circuit court hearing, and the trial. Me. I was the sole witness because no surveillance footage was acquired (for reasons unknown). Me.

Today was the trial. And, about 30 minutes ago, I got the call from the court that he was found guilty. He will be sentenced next Friday.

I bring this all up not because I want to brag about how I put an abuser behind bars. (Ironically, my current job before I go off to law school is providing civil legal services to people who are incarcerated. And, I don't see jail or prison as the best option for many). I bring this up because I never truly understood what it meant for someone to press charges against an abuser. Until now.

It means navigating a system that is tragically overwhelmed and jaded. It means having one of the worst things that has happened to you be treated like a day at the DMV.

Going to court the first time, I had to wait in the hall alongside this man. The second time, I had to pass him twice in the hall to find out I was supposed to be across the street in a completely different building for victims and witnesses. No one told me this. The third time, I was waiting alone in the hall for my moment to testify while they were on break. And, he walked past me in the hall back into the court room.

Each of those times, I felt myself reeling. The term revictimized had a more profound meaning. Not to mention how I had to endure being cross examined by his attorney, who was trying her hardest to make my story seem as if I was the instigator in my assault.

The thing is that I was not especially injured. I did not know this man. And, I feel confident that our paths will never cross again.

But, all I could do was imagine what this experience is like for victims of rape, domestic violence, or something else more violent and personal. The courage it takes to go through all this when the stakes are even higher is underappreciated. And, the reality of not wanting to file charges and not wanting to go through all this is overzealously criticized.

To all of you out there who have had to stand up and fight, I hear you and applaud you. And, I'm sorry you had to go through it, especially if you had to do it all alone. Having someone there to hold your hand makes all the difference.

To all of you out there who did not pursue action, I hear you too. I get why people don't report or take action. And, I'm sorry our system doesn't support you better.

Edit: I'm overwhelmed with support here. Thank you! For some reason, I am not getting access to every single comment, which I am trying to read and respond to accordingly. I'm sorry to anyone I couldn't.

For those of you who have asked for a link or proof that this is the truth, I have two things to say to you:

1. I understand wanting to get more information, but if your motivation is to verify my story (as some have overtly stated), you are part of the problem. Many victims don't report because of the fear of not being believed.

2. I already feel that I have provided too much information that a reasonable person could do this on their own. In fact, I'm a little worried that this post has gotten so much attention that if someone were to find the offender's information from the case docket, they'd be harassed, which may result in further violence or harassment on my part or another.

Any advice on this would be welcome, as he is not going to be incarcerated until his sentencing date.",TwoXChromosomes,27801,1562978197.0,574,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ccizyn/you_just_dont_know_until_it_happens_to_you/
My 13 year old brother has become an Andrew Tate fan and it’s getting scary.,"Idk if I'm dumb and I don't know how to use reddit, but I can't figure out how flairs work so I want to add a trigger warning for mentions of violence and SA.

&amp;#x200B;

*How it started*

I first noticed it what was happening I was driving him and my other sister to the mall on Black Friday. Seemingly out of no where, he asked us why there hasn’t ever been a female president.

In an awkward and maybe difficult to comprehend way, I started to explain that historically positions of power have been limited to a specific demographic and while there aren’t in current laws specifically preventing a woman from being president, no women has had the opportunity yet.

He stopped me at some point and told me that women were just too incompetent hold positions of power and there were a lot of things that men do a whole lot better than women.

As we started to go back on forth on it, I realized what was happening. I’d heard all of these weird manosphere talking points a million times and he was just recycling bad tiktock content.

I don’t want to go to far into the details because it’s a lot but, he’s said and done a lot of way worse stuff since then. Pretty much everyone in our immediately family has tried to talk to him about it (both individual and as a kind of intervention) and has eventually just given up with the hope that it’s just some messed up stage that he’ll eventually grow out of.

He’s was raised as the youngest child and the only boy in a single mom household, so I ever expected him to end up like this. Now, pretty much all of my other sisters keep him at a distance and make occasional jokes to each other about how he’s probably gonna end up in jail for beating women (or worse) when he grows up.

When we used to argue about the dumb misogynistic shit he get’s from the internet, I can see the corners of his mouth curl up into a smile when he get’s me upset or angry. When I ask him how he could take pleasure in seeing someone he cares about in distress, he denies it or mocks me further, he really is becoming a kind of a cruel kid.

&amp;#x200B;

*The incident and me being a bad adult*

The last time I tried to talk to him about this stuff, he ended up getting violent with me and repeatedly punching me in the face. He’s tried to hit me a few times before that but, there had always been family there to hold him back from attacking me.

He’s only 13 but he’s already 5’10 and has strength comparable to an adult man (by comparison I’m like 107 lbs and 5’3). I’d never been hit like that by anybody before and authentically terrified, I ended up having a very embarrassing and loud panic attack and we’ve pretty much kept away from each other ever since.

I’m not completely innocent in the situation. He was defending Andrew Tate and I asked him how he could follow advice from a man who had raped and sexually exploited so many women. He went on to deny any of it ever happened and used a lot of really mean victim blaming rhetoric in Tate’s defense.

At some point, I thought I could get him to take the situations seriously if I told him about some of my SA experiences from the military. He mocked and victim blamed me and I just couldn’t take it. I shoved a 13 yo autistic kid and he immediately went into a rage and started punching me over and over again with as much force as he possibly could as I started sobbing and wailing (quite humiliatingly), curled up into a ball, and tried to use my hand to block as much of the impact as I possibly could. I know I was wrong but I never thought I’d have such traumatic experiences mocked by anyone, let alone my own brother. I can't change the past but I know that'll I'll never do that shit again.

&amp;#x200B;

*Wtf should I even do at this point, if anything*

I don’t know what to do, I hate the kid but I still love him and want to help. He’s on the spectrum and had learning disabilities and I know life isn’t easy for him. I wish I could just hang out with him and get him out the house and interested in new hobbies until he stops caring about stupid manosphere shit but, it’s complicated. I’m not sure if I should just keep away to avoid lashing out and being an asshole to a literal child (or getting myself hurt physically speaking).

I know my mom isn’t the best parent and won’t be much help to him, even though she does try in her own way. Speaking of, my mom avoids certain topics because he has been aggressive and physically threatening to her in the past. When he’s not around, sometimes she half-jokes about how if she tried to take away his computer he’d probably snap and beat the shit out of her.

&amp;#x200B;

*Notes:*

*- I know he needs therapy but all of that’s kind of in my moms hands; she’s interested but has been moving slowly on it, despite my encouragement*

\- *I can’t call the cops on him if he get violent because we’re black and there a slight chance they might shoot one of us for racism and stuff*

*- He's on the spectrum, you can't put a percentage on Autism but it's to the extent where although most people don't notice not neurotypical upon first impression, people with experience working with kids like him are generally pretty quick to pick up on it*

**edit:**

**I was not expecting this post to blow up a little bit. I was super embarrassed about posting this and avoided checking reddit because I felt really guilty about the whole thing and was honestly fully expecting ridicule. I definitely feel less weird and more validated.**

**Last night, I decided to try to have a conversation about everything that happened and everything that lead up to it and offer my friendship and guidance and he was pretty receptive. He's autistic and had a meltdown and feels really bad about hurting me. Asking him a lot of questions while trying be as non-confrontational as possible seemed to help a lot.**

**Also, to all the people saying that he needs juvi, I really don't think that helps kids, it just makes them scared and angry and confused. Also, we're black, getting a little black boy involved with the criminal justice system sometimes ends up becoming a life-long situation.**

&amp;#x200B;

**edit 2:**

**Just to be clear, no one in my family openly mocks or laughs at him. There have been occasional jokes when he's not present, but everyone is almost exclusively kind and supportive in his actual presence.**

**My family and I are a group of deeply unserious people and we generally tend to laugh with each other a lot. I think when they make these jokes, they're kind of a way of acknowledging how serious the situation is without making everyone feel awful and sad.**

**The reality of the situation is if we can't help him before get get's older, he might do something really bad later on in life, and that's a hard pill to swallow. Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.**

**It's not perfectly mature, but we're all our 20's and have some growing up to do. And I'll give my mom a pass because as much as they love each other, he really does put her through hell a regular.**",TwoXChromosomes,3133,1688877671.0,591,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14up4zo/my_13_year_old_brother_has_become_an_andrew_tate/
Customer tries to break into bathroom,"My trans child (22 y o, f to nb) and I both work in a coffee shop that is inside a department store. Yesterday, my kid (I'll call them K) went to use the restroom. They use the family bathroom because it is for any gender. Looking at K, if you dont know them, they look like a 14 - 16 year old boy.

As they got to the bathroom, an older man (65 ish) came out of the men's room. He walked right up behind K. K ran into the family bathroom, pushed the door closed, and locked it. Not a moment later this guy tried to open the door.

Now K is texting me but I'm with a customer so I dont see it. After the customer walks away I check my phone because K has been gone about 5 mins and Im like ???

I see the texts but the guy is a few feet away from the bathroom so at first I thought they were over reacting. As I'm watching however,  he goes over and asks an employee to open the door, then tries the handle again and *pounds* on the door  full force.

I throw my apron off and run over. I call through the door that it's me. I maneuvered to block him from seeing K and K comes out. 

""He's been in there 15 minutes""
Me: he ain't been gone no 15 minutes
""The fuck he hasnt""
Me: well pounding on the door really helped didnt it??

The guy watches us walk back to the café and then goes into the bathroom.

Keep in mind he had just left the men's room, and that he watched K go in and then immediately tried the door. When he came out we have supervisors with us so he knew we told them. He walked around the store and then stared at K the whole time he was cashing out. I was *ready* but he didnt come over.

Yes, we reported everything. K was given the option to press charges but didnt really want the guy provoked any further. However if he returns to the store security will be watching. 

Edit: thank you for the support/concern. K is okay. They clocked out early last night and cried a good long while. They're working today but their fiance (a big ole cis man) went with them and will attend if K uses the rest room. They're gonna use the employee bathroom from now on (we usually dont because it is further away, and usually busy because it's 1 toilet for like 100 people) to avoid any more customers. 

We are thinking the guy wanted to assault K because he tried to open the door quietly at first but got angry when it was locked. As he'd just come out the men's room he obviously didn't have to pee. He saw what he thought was a young boy alone and went for it. 

Edit again: FROM K
So as my mom said, I am a 22-year-old nb person. While working at the café, I decided to take a bathroom break. So I take my apron off, all that jazz, and waddle my happy ass over to the public bathroom. Now earlier that day, something went down that I don't need to go over, but it was... weird. Not bad, no one was hurt, but kids being dumb kids, basically.

So I knock on the family bathroom, hear someone yell they're in there, then just back up and wait. While I'm waiting, the creepy guy came out of the men's and walked slowly past me, all while staring right at me. He went a little ways past me before rounding back to stand a little ways off to the side behind me.

Now I instantly get a bad feeling in my gut. I really shouldn't have gone in, but I had to take a wicked piss. So I go in and shove the door shut fast and click the lock. Mind you, these doors are super heavy and have a thing to make them close slowly, but I was shoving it hard to make it faster. I then went and did my business. I also cannot confirm, but I swear I heard him move towards me as I went in. It was loud in the store, though, so no real idea on if he did.

But now, to be fair, I did get distracted on my phone. By this time of day, it was nearly closing and I had barely been able to even see if anyone messaged me, let alone anything else, the whole shift. So I took the chance to watch a few YouTube shorts. After maybe two, which neither were even close to a minute together, the door handle jingles. Confuses me, but I assume someone thought it was unlocked and tested it. Bear in mind, I still had that bad feeling.

So I go back to my phone and message mom about it, wanting her to come over so I had someone there and wasn't alone, someone suddenly POUNDS on the fucking door. I immediately start tweaking and spamming her I was in danger, that my gut was telling me I would be hurt in some way if I opened the door. Thankfully, during all this, she taught me from a very young age to always trust my gut. This was really the first time in my life I had to even use it.
Originally, she thought I was overreacting. I have issues and disorders that tend to make me blow things outta proportion, so totally understandable. But once he went at the door, she came running. I was starting to have a panic attack when I heard her call to me through the door. Never says my name, though. So I rush to get out, and she walks directly next to me to block me from his view and is snarky to him.

I never heard really what was said, I was way too in my head and panicked to really pay attention and process it. We go back, and I get my apron back on quick because the café was left unattended and there were customers. I rush through drinks, messing them up because I'm still having a panic attack. She lets me go hide in the kitchen, so I go back there and call my fiancée to try and calm down.

I spend about half an hour back there, full on sobbing. Like, I was NOT okay. I end up needing to clock out and just sit in the back of the café where I could see everything and my back to the corner of the room. I cried on and off then, explaining to my boss and other team leaders of the department store what happened, and later on talked to the security of the store. I told them exact times I was in there, thank you Discord, described the man, and told them what happened.

I decided to not press charges despite being able to because I really am praying that it happening to me was a one time thing and not targeted. I also didn't want to rile him up and him do much worse. But the team leaders, store directer, and everyone in charge there and who has any sort of power, they all know who he is and exactly what he looks like due to the cameras. If he tries shit again, they know who to show to the police.

And.. That's about it. Work today was uneventful and honestly quite fun! I was still paranoid, thanks to that all happening, but my fiancée came with me and spent the day just in case, lol.

And thank you to everyone who commented in my mother's post, I read them all, and it really helped me feel like I didn't overreact. Genuinely, from the bottom of my heart, thank you all for the support &lt;3",TwoXChromosomes,2227,1745851097.0,176,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1k9x4s2/customer_tries_to_break_into_bathroom/
A man tried to kiss me outside a bar and pulled my hair to stop me from getting away.,"I was outside a bar with friends having a great time with a small group of guys. One of them was hitting on me all night and saying he wanted to kiss me but I was clear about being in a long term (10+ year) relationship. He managed to corner me when we were all outside smoking and grabbed my face to kiss me and when I turned around and walked away he balled all my hair(waist length) in a ball and yanked me towards him to try again. I managed to break free and put chairs between us.

When we all returned to the bar he tried to get me alone again but when I said no he yelled at me “What the fuck is wrong with you” I immediately wanted to leave and sobbed all the way home with my friends. 

I feel guilty for being nice to him. Is this my fault!? I feel like I’ve been assaulted. Have I been? Am I being overly dramatic? I feel so upset and violated right now.

Edit:

I feel like I should clarify some things. 

We are currently in a foreign country where people generally say not to trust the police. If I were in my home country I want to say I would have reacted differently but I felt completely and totally unsafe making a scene. He is gone from the resort today and unfortunately I do not have any of his information.

I was not with my SO because we are on an all girls trip.

No one really saw what he did since we smoked in a huge gazebo and I went to a corner to separate myself from the group since he was making me uncomfortable. Imagine a circle of people around a table talking and me behind them about 10 feet back in the dark. In hindsight I should have not separated myself from the group and vocalized my feelings towards him to my friends more outwardly. It’s was a horrible situation all around but I have learned from it. I will never ever enable someone like this to be alone with me again especially where they could easily follow me to my room and be ready to strike.

Also, thanks to everyone who is encouraging me to quit smoking. I did quit smoking in 2020 but I do have the scattered cigarette when on vacation.

As for the people who have commented on my mental health… yes I do struggle with mental health. How dare you take away from victims of abuse because they have mental health issues as if that changes the situation at all.

That’s all I really have to say. I think I’m still in shock today but I am so grateful for your support.",TwoXChromosomes,6294,1681716625.0,321,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12p6np0/a_man_tried_to_kiss_me_outside_a_bar_and_pulled/
My Husband thought he had Coronavirus but has Leukemia instead.,"I have no idea where to post this but could really use some support right now. My husband and I live in Michigan. As some of you might know, michigan is kind of a hotspot for the coronavirus right now. We had been in quarantine since before the start of the stay at home order. However on April first, my husband started to have a fever and a cough. 

Things slowly started to get worse. About 4 days after he started feeling sick, I started to have symptoms. We were both experiencing the same types of things, fever, chills, fatigue, and a dry cough. We thought for sure this was the beginning of the virus. 

I would be considered a high risk person to get the virus. I am overweight and have preexisting conditions. Naturally I was concerned for myself, my husband is a fit, 26 year old man, who has no pre existing conditions. I figured he would be just fine. 

All of the sudden I was starting to get better. I started to have energy to do things again, while my husband just gradually started to decline. One night he passed out because his blood oxygen level got too low. When the ambulance arrived, they told me that he was fine after taking his vitals and that he just needed to take it easy. 

Every single time my husband would stand up, his blood oxygen would tank. And by tank, I mean 80s or 70s. He insisted that he was fine because the EMT's said he was fine. I argued with him for hours trying to get him to go to the hospital, but he refused. He was scared to go because of the virus, the lack of supplies, the shortage of staff and he didn't want to take up space for someone else. But mostly he didn't want to be left alone. 

I finally gave up and agreed to let him stay home. For the next few days, I took care of him. He would move the bare minimum. I was constantly waking up during the night to check his vitals and waiting on him hand and foot. He was just so sick. The day before he went to the hospital he slept for about 16 hours, longer then I had ever seen him sleep before. 

The day he went in he had a final exam. He was just so sick that he couldn't take it. He was freaking out because yet again, he was struggling to breath. He would walk about 15 feet to go sit on the couch and be so short of breath that he couldn't even speak. He finally agreed to go in, fully expecting to only be in the hospital for a short period of time. 

When we got there they rushed him back. I had to yell I love you and goodbye from the door. I didn't get to hold his hand, or hug him goodbye. He was just taken back and I was told to go home. 

Thankfully he is in a good hospital where they worked extremely fast. Running initial blood work showed that his hemoglobin was at 3, making this life threatening. In less than four hours, he was diagnosed with AML leukemia. Our world had been flipped upside down. His short hospital stay had turned in to 4 weeks. Our whole future has been put into question. All of the sudden we went from thinking it was the virus to talking about chemotherapy and fertility problems. 

Worst of all is the waiting. We are still waiting for the results from the gene study that determines which subtype of AML leukemia he has. This determines how treatable it is and what we can do moving forward. He is already well into chemo and doing his best to fight this. He has developed a mild pneumonia to top it all off and has trouble talking for longer than a few minutes without hacking up a lung. If we video chat he gets emotional because he just wants nothing more than to come home. 

Here is why I think this is appropriate to post here. My heart is broken as a women. My whole life plan has been put into question. I don't know if we will ever be able to have children or grow old together. I don't know what to expect or where this will go. 

This is even worse considering that the pandemic is going on. I am now at home alone with my thoughts. I am not allowed to go see him at all. I am not allowed to go see my family at all because they are all high risk for the virus. I am not allowed to even go do normal ass things like go to the grocery store without fear. 

This is my worst nightmare. I have been through one hell of a lot in my life but this is easily the most difficult thing I will ever go through. My heart is breaking because the most important person in the world to me is hurting so badly and there is nothing I can do. Everyday here alone is my own personal hell. I have no idea how we are going to get through this. My heart just hurts and I am scared. 

Sorry for the long rant. I am just not doing okay.

Also if you think you have the virus, this is why you should try to get tested.. it could be something else. Including something much, much worse.",TwoXChromosomes,15421,1587598091.0,543,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/g6bwdp/my_husband_thought_he_had_coronavirus_but_has/
"Today, I scared off a creeper following 2 preteen girls.","Today, I (40f) took my toddler to a nearby playground park. The park is right next to a middle school, and we heard school let out while my kid was playing. 

A few minutes later, 2 preteen girls (12-13yo?) walk thru the playground to hang out on the swing set. Giggling and talking to each other. But about 15-20ft behind them was a 30-40yo strung out creeper dude who couldn't take his eyes off them. My gut was screaming he was up to no good. He looked high as fuck on meth. Before the girls arrived, I had already picked up my kid to walk back to our car. But as we walked closer to the entrance, I heard the creep was mumbling ""I shouldn't, I shouldn't. Not now."" He saw me watching him like a hawk. We made eye contact and he immediately turned around and started walking out of the park. But he kept stopping to look at 'hiding' spots within eyeline to the playground (behind a big tree, behind the bathroom building, and next to a big forest) I kept positioning myself in a way so he could still see I was very obviously watching him. 

The park was very big, and there were others there, but nowhere near the playground. So I lingered with my kid. Watching as the creep left the park grounds and wobbled down the street.

I quietly approached the girls and asked if they knew that guy. They didn't even realize there was anyone behind them. I calmly described him and said he followed them into the playground and to keep a good eye out as they went home. Asked them to please be safe. I apologized for saying something so scary, but I wanted them to stay out of harm's way.

What made me most sad was one girl was terrified, the other was completely unphased and said ""I've been stalked before. I'll pay better attention."" The one girl was about to cry, the other  acted like it was no big deal.

I called the cops and reported the creep at the park. He had walked away down the street by that point, but I couldn't shake that feeling that I was meant to be there at that exact moment.

I’m having an abortion 3 months after my daughter was born,"When i was pregnant with my daughter i felt like it was a blessing. the moment i saw the 2 lines i got so happy. we weren’t trying and she was a complete accident but i was still ecstatic to be carrying life.  

it’s been 3 months and i love her dearly. i’m a SAHM and i love spending my days with her, although i do get very much needed breaks. she is just the light of my life and everything i do is for her. me and my husband agreed this will be our one and only child because it worked for us.

2 days ago i saw those familiar lines again. this time happiness did not come right away. this time i was pissed. this time i cursed in my pillow until my face was blue. i cried myself to sleep that night. it was different this time. i felt my plans to go back to school fade away. i saw 2 babies in diapers. i saw 2 babies to feed. i saw two doctor bills, two school payments, two of everything. i saw my attention, time and money being taken away from my daughter who is just an infant right now herself. 

1 day ago i scheduled an abortion consultant. i feel incredibly stupid for getting pregnant again. i feel ashamed in having my daughter but choosing to end this pregnancy. i am firm and secure that this is the best decision for my family but the guilt is eating me alive. if i’m being 100% honest i’m scared to even post this. we haven’t told anyone and we’re not going to. i just needed to put my thoughts and feelings out there. thanks for listening.

EDIt: 
just wanted to add because i might be a lot of questions i was on two different types of birth control both times. the depo shot and then the mini pill because i still breastfed my daughter

edit: 
i didn’t know expect this much support thank you everyone for the kind words. last night i was thinking about it and i am still firm in my decision to choose abortion. my guilt is coming from a mix of the fact that this happened again,  society expectations that since i have had my daughter that i’m suppose to have any and all pregnancies following her and my daughter loosing a potential sibling. but those are not dealbreakers to me. yes they are making me feel like shit right now but my decision is strong that i am not mentally, physically and financially ready for another baby SO soon. abortion right now in this circumstances is right for me and my family. again thank you everyone for the kind words they are very much appreciated in a dark time in my life.",TwoXChromosomes,7975,1570948269.0,945,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dh70la/im_having_an_abortion_3_months_after_my_daughter/
"Today, I could not have been more thankful to run into that ""annoying neighbour""","First time poster here ... To start this off right let me say that Mitch is not annoying, but there are times I just want to peacefully enjoy my walk with my dog, and really don't want to engage in conversation with anyone, and times I've been trapped in a conversation or two where all I want to do is escape. 

Well, this evening was a completely different story. I live in a condo complex that has 5 buildings. I was leaving the complex to walk my dog when I spotted a driver who had stopped and was staring at me. I thought nothing of it, kept walking as he drove away slowly and carried on getting off the property and to the park. Well, I get to the street, and sure enough the same car is sitting there, we make eye contact, he stares for a couple more seconds and drives away. By this point my guards are up, the way he looked me up and down sent chills up my spine. I keep walking down the street, main goal being to get inside the semi-busy park and surround myself with people, when sure enough this same car turns the corner back onto the street I'm walking down and I notice he begins to slow down. As soon as I saw him I thought, grab your phone and pretend you have a call. So I'm walking down the street, talking to myself and he drives by very slow and gives me that look again. Once he passed and I saw him turn back into my complex I hauled ass to the park where I stopped to gather my thoughts, and this is where Mitch came over. 

He came up to me, we did our usual hello's and he paused for a moment before he said ""I don't mean to intrude, but I noticed while you were walking, you kept looking over your shoulder a lot. Are you ok?"" At that moment I didn't know if I told him what was happening if he would think I was overreacting, or if he would understand why I felt scared. I explained what was happening, and without even batting an eye he said ""My pup and I would like to continue our walk with you, if you feel comfortable with that?"". Of course I said yes, and we carried on through the park. I felt my shoulders relax and knew I was safe. 

Once we got to the point where my walk would end he said ""Would you like me to walk you to your building (the farthest away) just to make sure everything is ok?"" My response was, nah I think I'm ok, what are the odds of him sticking around ... 2 seconds later, he pulls out of the complex again, and gives me the creepy stare before he drives off. At that point, without hesitation Mitch says ""Let's carry on"". As we are walking he so calmly says to me ""If I see that car again, I am going to gently take your hand in mine as if we are a couple, as long as you are ok with that? And if so I need you to do two things. Nod in agreement, and move your leash to your other hand so your hand closest to me is available"". I didn't have to think twice, I nodded as I moved the leash and we continued to walk and carry on conversation like nothing had happened. 

I got to my building's main entrance safely, and I didn't know what to say. I couldn't thank this man enough for being so protective of me, a woman he had only had a few interactions with here and there. It was then he took a few minutes to explain his background, and it made a lot more sense. He was an ex-Israeli soldier who left Israel when his Mom was constantly being abused by his Father and no one would help. He used all his money to move his Mom, little sister and their family dog to a safe place far away from his Father until he could join them. He said it was at that point, he decided he would do everything in his power to ensure women felt safe and secure, no matter the circumstances. 

I learned a lot tonight, and I feel like if it weren't for Mitch, something bad could have happened. I appreciated his soft, consensual approach to me, especially when he could see I was struggling and stressed. The world needs more men like Mitch.





***UPDATE: Firstly, OMG you guys. I have never felt soooo loved and heard from a group of strangers. Honestly you guys made my day. Waking up and seeing all of your responses, I couldn't help but cry. You are all an amazing group of humans and thank you again for the support 🩷

I went and filed a police report after work, with as much detail as I had, model of the car, colour, description of the guy. Sadly my brain went into panic mode and I did not get the license plate. I also notified the condo management company and they in turn have advised our security to be on the lookout. Again thank you everyone for all of your suggestions, and words of encouragement. 

Secondly, some of you are both hilarious and have very twisted minds lol. Trust me, this was not some creepy set up by Mitch. His reactions to me were very genuine, and I could not be more grateful for him and everything he did. 

Lastly, for those who are saying my title was mean or that I didn't appreciate Mitch by referring to the ""annoying neighbour"". I think I made it very clear that I DO NOT see him that way at all, and I am extremely, EXTREMELY grateful for his help last night. I cried when I got home before I posted this because I was so overwhelmed with his kindness and support. I kept asking him how I could pay him back, but he said there was no need. Just to stay safe, and come find him if I ever need his help. I'm sorry that out of my entire post, all you could focus on was the title. That really was not the point of me sharing.

Oh and really lastly lol I don't know if he's married/single/in a relationship 😂 he didn't mention this while we were walking and talking.

I went to the police station armed with my video. I told the policeman I already talked with them on the phone and they instructed me to record him. The policeman (let's call him best-cop-ever) took it very seriously from the start. I made it clear that i am scared of this guy and i don't want him to know about me going to the police. Best-cop-ever responded:

""Don't be scared of guys like this. After we're done with him he will never bother you again. From now on you have us to protect you. If you want we can even take him in custody. Wait for me to finish some paperwork and we will go face him together"". 

Of course I was scared shitless but a little voice in me said ""go girl, look this perv in the eyes, stop being scared of men, this is your chance."" So I agreed.

So best-cop-ever took me and 2 more policemen and we walked until my street. I showed him where I live, where his balcony is and everything. He rang every doorbell in his building, and then we went up the stairs and asked any neighbor we could find for info. Finally we arrived to his apartment and were met with 2 teenage boys. The best-cop-ever zoomed in the video on his phone to show them the face without showing the act. The boys both claimed this was their dad and that he is at work.

The cops told the boys some fake story, and told them to call their dad and tell him to make it his priority to call the chief of police (of the local department). They said it isnt anything bad and they shouldn't worry. They also took the personal info of the dad. We walked in the apartment to check the view from his masturbating position and my balcony is perfectly visible. Not only that, I noticed he deliberately put a chair in front of the window every night to be able to see me, because there was no chair at the moment where he usually sits. At that point I remembered that the first time I saw him masturbate he was siting on the couch, but later, when it started becoming a daily thing, he moved closer to the balcony door. 

We left and I thanked all of them. Later in the day best-cop-ever texted me that the guy arrived in the police department. I asked how it went and he texted me that it went great and he promised never to do it again.

In my country there is a very strong anti-police sentiment and I have to say my views have changed after this incident. I understand all the problems of the police but I cannot ignore how amazingly best-cop-ever and his co-workers handled my case. I will be forever grateful!

This happened yesterday and masturbating neighbor finally learned how to draw his curtains (yeaaa). What a win. I hope I will  never see his dick again, but if i do i know i have a support system now! I do get a bit paranoid though and I am very careful when I enter and exit my building just in case. But so far so good.

Thanks for the support! I have been scared of perverts due to traumatic experiences since years and this is the first time I react. It was hard but now I feel way stronger than before. Hopefully this guy learned his lesson. Much love to everybody!

I don’t think men understand how much we fear them,"I’m working out by myself in a somewhat rural area (22F) and my store closes at 7:45 automatically, auto locking the door. Last night while closing alone a man came to the shop door at 7:45 exactly. I had forgotten to turn the neon open sign off so I apologized and told him we were closed. All the while this man is continuing to aggressively try and open the door. I’m refusing to let him in shocked as this man keeps trying to open the door despite me standing there and telling him we are closed repeatedly. The man then tells me that I can let him in because he’s “not A…” he literally said that and then stopped himself when he realized what he was about to say. This man then tells me (through the glass door) that he is having car troubles and asks if he can stay in our parking lot. There is a gas station right down the street. I assumed his car was broken down here though so I told him that was fine. I waited to leave the store until I knew he was actually there for car assistance and not just waiting for me to get off.  Flash to this morning, I open the store again. The same man from last night I witnessed getting road assistance is still in the parking lot. He sees me get out of my car and I am trying to get inside to open the store on time, he decides to try and flag me down for something. I straight bolted into the store and as I’m sitting here typing this he’s still in the parking lot. I truly think he is clueless that I find him off putting in anyway. I also don’t see how he doesn’t get the hint I was scared/ am scared of him.

Edit: am I crazy or justified in feeling this way? Idk.

Update: I have texted my coworkers to warn them of this situation in case he returns. I also forgot to mention that I feel as if he was trying to gauge if I was alone or not because he specifically asked if I had a manager there I could tell (in regards to him parking there). Overall gives me the heebie jeebies. If he returns again I will be calling the Non emergency line to have someone come and tell him what is up. I will be taking no chances to make this weird man feel comfortable.",TwoXChromosomes,2846,1695741315.0,460,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16sqqq8/i_dont_think_men_understand_how_much_we_fear_them/
"I was almost abducted at 19 at my work and when I reported it minutes after, they did nothing","Worked at a grocery store for 2 days. I bagged groceries. Rule was you HAD to walk the bags out to the customer's car if they asked.

My second day where I actually started, I had a few nice ladies who needed help to their car. And then this older guy in his 50s comes up.

He had maybe 4 things and saw that I had just come back from helping someone. He kept smiling at me and I felt creeped out, but customer service meant smiling and being polite.

He then asked that I take the one bag to his car. I looked at my cashier and at my boss who was at the front of the store. No one stopped, no one thought it was weird.

I was about 120lbs and 19 years old. As I walked out he told me he picked my aisle on purpose. That he wanted to get me away from there.

When we got to his car, he doesnt open his trunk, he opens the front seat driver side of the car. He has me pinned between his car and the one he is parked next to, with him blocking my only exit.

He then starts to say he has a cabin and wants to take me there. He says he will take good care of me. I politely say I have to get back to work. He says, ""you wont have to work with me"".

He has me there for 20 minutes by now, no one has come. I'm alone in the parking lot. He is now starting to get closer and keeps inisiting I leave with him and that I am pretty.

I say my boss is going to come out and I have to go. He looks angry. I put his bag in, making sure I dont stick my head in so he cant push me. I quickly push his door closed and run back inside.

I'm in tears. Hysterical. I went to the manager who brought me to the security room in the back. I ask them if they got it on tape and they didnt even look. I describe the man to them and the situation. They didnt call the cops and tell me to get back to work. I then ask if I can refuse to walk to a car if I feel unsafe. THEY SAY NO, ITS PART OF MY JOB.

I quit on the spot. Never get a call. No follow up.

I felr ashamed because I lost my job and my feeling of safety all in one day.

I learned several life lessons that day.
1. No one will believe you
2. No one will care
3. You are on your own
And 4. No justice will ever come out of telling

That was 12 years ago, since then I've been sexually assaulted twice after that. Once at an office job and once by a good friend of the family. I've also received verbal sexual harassment at another office job.

Now I make sure I don't wear too much makeup, I dress extremely modest, I leave my work before everyone else, and I dont go grocery shopping alone.

Update: I expected to just get a few responses so wow! I was up late last night and just felt like I had to post this somewhere. At first I did it on my facebook but chickened out and deleted that. So I posted it here. I had mentioned it on facebook a few years back without the details and my dad came out and commented that it never happened. I remember I went to my parents and told them the day it happened, I remember him not believing me and then later acting like I overreacted. He was really pissed that I had quit. Now he doesnt remember...

I was 19 and was scared. I was still in that mentality that most adults are right. I went to my parents and they were more angry at me. So I was afraid to call the cops. 

Also, the 20 minutes he stared at me and talked about his bikes and his cabin. I was sweating bullets and frozen. He was parked next to a car and had the driver door open and I was between his car door and him.


Thank you to everyone who commented with support. Even if there isnt any justice for what happened, it has been very liberating knowing i have at least been heard and believed. 

Also, some of the comments are awful. But I've learn to laugh at most of it.

Single Ladies: Do Not Rely on your Coupled-Up Friends to Look Out for You,"This is my annual cautionary tale to single ladies during the holidays: do not rely on your friends who are in couples to look out for you. It doesn't matter how long you've known them. The only person you can rely on is yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Four years ago I attended a wedding of two close friends in Philadelphia. During the reception, someone stole my phone thinking it belonged to the bride. I knew my phone was missing, but I was with friends, staying in an AirBNB with 9 other people, so I figured I could catch a ride with one of them to get back to the AirBNB.

Wrong.

The reception hall closed around 10pm, so a bunch of people (including most of my AirBNB housemates) took Ubers to a local bar. We were having a great time until about 2am. Someone in the group said it was time to leave, so I told my housemates that I would go pay my bar tab and be right back. By the time I paid my bar tab and got back to the group, they had already gotten in their Ubers and left. At this point, I was in a city I'd never been to before, without a phone, in the middle of the night, alone. I stayed at the bar for awhile thinking SURELY one of the NINE people I was sharing a house with would notice I wasn't there. 

Only one person noticed I wasn't there. She also happened to be the only other person in the house who didn't bring a plus one. 

She brought up fact that I hadn't come back to some of the other people in the house **who insisted I must have gone home with some guy from the wedding.** So not only did these people, people I had known for over five years at that point, not notice I wasn't there, but when it was pointed out to them, they literally didn't care. Why didn't they care? Because they were too focused on their dates. It is worth mentioning that everyone in this group was in their late 20s/early 30s. These are not college kids drunk at a bar. These are reliable professionals. Until they aren't.

These people knew I didn't have my phone. They knew I was in an unfamiliar city. And they abandoned me. After eventually getting booted from the bar around 2:15/2:30am when it finally closed, I wandered the streets of Fishtown by myself, inebriated, with no idea where I was or how to get back to my AirBNB, wearing a party dress and flip-flops, until 4:30am. I was terrified. I walked until I recognized my car, then banged on the door of my AirBNB sobbing until the ONE person who knew I was in trouble found me. Everyone else had gone to sleep. 

No one called the cops. No one went to look for me. Prior to this event, I would have trusted these people with my life. Now, I only trust one of them, and I have mostly cut contact with the other 8.

Do not trust your friends in couples to look out for you this holiday season. You cannot rely on them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: People keep replying that I should have had the bar call a taxi. Call a taxi to take me where? I didn’t have the address of the Airbnb memorized because I had the address *in my phone*. I didn’t think I’d need to memorize it. Also, you can’t log into Airbnb without your phone number receiving a text. The only way I got back to the Airbnb was by walking until I recognized my car.

Also, to be clear, I know now that my friends were shitty friends. That’s why I’m not friends with them anymore. But most people don’t know how far their friends will (or won’t) go for them until you’re in a situation like this. Which is why my advice is to never rely on friends, even ones you think are trustworthy. DO NOT go out if you have no independent way of getting yourself home. Write down your address. Memorize a reliable friend’s phone number. These are all things I’ve done since, but things that I didn’t know I needed to do.",TwoXChromosomes,3314,1670130848.0,609,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zc18tm/single_ladies_do_not_rely_on_your_coupledup/
"I feel really bad for breaking off my 6 year friendship with a guy, but I feel he did something unforgivable.","So my friend(34) wanted to go star gazing with me (34), and told me we were going to a popular beach with Christmas lights and a pier. 

Instead he drove out in the middle of nowhere to a sketchy abandoned parking lot (I guess some sort of parking lot that leads to hiking trails) late at night. I felt very afraid. 

There were only two other vehicles there. A white van with two sketchy guys weirdly loading things and exchanging things in the back. And a giant truck with a guy smoking in it. 

I was too scared to leave the car becuase I was in a cute dress suited for the pier and for a nice dinner. My friend stubbornly left me in the car alone for 40 minutes to go use his camera equipment to take pictures of the stars.

I begged him several times that I didn't feel safe and that this wasn't the plan, which was to see christmas lights at the pier.

He just said ""I could do these things alone, you know. I dont actually need you here.""

Then on the way home, I was very upset. He basically made jokes that I was old and who would want to kidnap me anyways. 

I didn't talk to him for 2 weeks, but last night I gave him a chance to apologize and met with him. Instead he made awkward jokes the whole night about how everyone must want to kidnap me in my fantasy. 

Then he drove me around to do chores like shop for Christmas, and refused to do any stops I wanted or bring me back for hours. Additionally, on the phone he was super rude to his own mother. I was trapped again becuase he was the driver. 

I just followed along quietly trying to put on a good face, so I could get home.

When we got back to his place, he actually had the audacity to try to follow me for a hug goodbye, and I literally just bolted to my car and drove off. 

Idk, even though there is absolutely no reason I should blame myself for getting rid of this friend, I still feel so sad to do so. 

Ever since his father died 3 years ago, he has not been the same person. To everyone else he is an angel. He only seems to save this bad treatment for me.

Edit to clarify: IDK if he wanted a hug. We are only platonic and he is not into me at all (he's not into women and doesn't want any relationships with anyone). I just basically dashed off to my car and said bye quickly, and he's like ""Oh, That's all? Okay...""",TwoXChromosomes,3461,1702939961.0,310,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18lm3uf/i_feel_really_bad_for_breaking_off_my_6_year/
I want to share my story of being married to a sociopath,"I (41f) married my ex (39m) after a year of dating. In the beginning, he seemed like the perfect catch. Charming, hardworking, hilarious, down to earth, interesting, very loving, very supportive. I had moved in with him after about 8 months of dating. Soon after, he asked me to marry him. I remember feeling so happy and excited then. I felt like I had finally met the love of my life. But as time went on, he started showing signs that something was off.

He was also hiding his alcoholism. Which turned into him being full blown plastered every night. The best part was that I would get home later. I knew as I was driving home, I would be coming home to him drunk and pissed off. In the beginning, he would casually drink. Come to find out, after finding his bottle stash that he was drinking every night. Hiding bottles in dressers, closets, the garage. He was constantly lying about his drinking.

He would get upset about every little thing I did. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells. One of my favorite hobbies is coloring with markers - it's very therapeutic and relaxing for me. I remember trying to color next to him on the couch, and we got in an argument about how I wasn't paying enough attention to him. I eventually stopped coloring completely. Because I knew it would just end up in an argument. I stopped doing every single thing that brought me joy. Every single thing. He was slowly but surely manipulating me into being his perfect, submissive shell of a wife.

It didn't matter what I did, everything I did was wrong. I couldn't say the right thing, I couldn't do the right thing, nothing I did was ever enough. I work full time, would get groceries, clean the house, constantly picking up his mess. In the winter, when his work got slower, I would cover all the bills and food. I was constantly broke because of this. I would come home after a long day to him being off work that day and already drunk. I remember getting a lot of ""hey bud,"" ""wasup dude,"" ""hey sailor"" greetings when I walked through the door. I knew my night was going to be hell. Every night was a living hell.

I learned how to be compliant. I basically completely, totally lost myself and my whole goal was to keep him from snapping. So I stopped saying my opinion about anything, I stopped even talking sometimes because what he had to say was more important than anything I thought or felt. I was constantly agreeing with him. Even though I knew he was wrong. He could say the sky was red, and I would agree. Anything I could do to keep him from going into a - breaking things, screaming at me, stomping around the house, threatening me or my cats...nightmare that was my life. I was constantly on edge. I had this feeling like my life was constantly being threatened or my welfare was always in danger.

He would hurt my cats. My older cat Billy would be laying in bed, and he'd just kick her off the bed because she was in the way. She's 12 years old and I could tell it hurt her. The worst feeling in the world was not being able to stand up for them because I knew at any moment he could snap. He would chase Pepper around the house ""playing"" but I knew she was uncomfortable and hated it. She learned, eventually like I did, you can hide from him and in his drunken idiocy, he won't find you. I learned to find all the good hiding spots in the house so that he would just pass out in bed and leave me alone. It made me sick that I had put my cats in this unsafe environment. It made me sick to see them being abused and feeling so afraid, that I couldn't do anything about it.

He would gaslight me. At the time, I was being manipulated so bad, I don't think I could tell up from down. I remember there was this constant argument that I would tell a story and he would later ""figure out"" that I was lying. In his mind, this story really happened...I went to a drug dealer with my ex. Had sex with the drug dealer in exchange for drugs. And my ex had pulled a gun out on the drug dealer after some disagreement. This of course never happened. And I never told this story but in his mind I was constantly lying. I would constantly feel like I was losing my mind. Things like ""you said your favorite band was \_\_\_\_ the other day, why are you lying to me?""

Sex was always an issue. Either we weren't having enough sex - which it was at worst every other day or few days. Or he was having performance issues that were my fault. There were times when I didn't want to have sex, but I would anyways, because he was so drunk and out of his mind that I feared what would happen if I said no. So I learned to just do what makes him happy. At least then, I wouldn't be hurt physically. I had to stop having sex one night because my blood sugar was dropping and I was feeling light headed. Which turned into him screaming at me as I'm sitting in the kitchen waiting for my blood sugar to get back to normal. Wouldn't help me. Didn't care about how I was feeling.

He would just scream at me over everything. One time, I had about a week off work for Christmas break. He had to go back to work, while I had 3 more days off. He went to bed and started yelling things like ""no, no this is bullshit. Why do I have to go to work and you get to sit on your ass all day. Fuck this shit."" Proceeded to come up and scream at me for having more 'time off' than him. I ended up going outside and hiding in the neighbor's yard just to get away from him.

One night, he drunkenly falls down the stairs. Fell down a tall stairway onto the basement floor and hit his head hard. I was upstairs using the restroom and didn't hear it. He bolts upstairs and starts screaming at me ""why the fuck aren't you helping me, I just fell down the stairs you fucking bitch, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you..."" And I just froze. I learned early on to just stop talking and take the hateful talk. No matter what I did. I just had to agree with him, so he wouldn't hurt me. He was dangerously violent. I started to feel like I was on the verge of being horribly hurt physically or killed. One night he was ""showing me a karate move"" and ""accidentally"" punched my nose hard. My nose bled. I didn't go to the hospital because I pulled the ""I'm fine."" There is no doubt in my mind that he did it on purpose.

The last time I ever saw him was when I went back to him briefly after moving out. I went to bed at midnight. He wanted to stay up to finish his drink. I had a long work week and was exhausted. I like catching up on sleep on the weekends. So he had come to bed at 3am trying to get fresh with me. I woke up to him feeling me up basically. I said no and rolled over with my back towards him. He continued to touch me, uncomfortably. I rolled back over to face him and he was staring at me with this look that was absolutely terrifying. It looked like his pupils were dilated. The only way I can describe it was pure evil in his eyes. He was making fists in the air. I said ""are you awake?"" and he then squeezed me way too hard like he was trying to hug me. I knew it was intentional. He would do things often where he would be way too strong armed with me as a point of - you're not following my every whim and I'm going to hurt you enough to where it couldn't be viewed as 'violent.' But you can feel when someone is being too strong with you. He was upset because he wasn't getting any and wanted to hurt me as punishment, I believe. I got my stuff and drove home at 3am.

He was diagnosed as sociopathic. I do believe he is narcissistic as well. He's also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism. I have bipolar (medicated), autism, and major depressive disorder. Trying to navigate how to heal from this has been very hard. I feel lost and lonely at times. Trying to figure out what I need to do to heal all the damage that's been done. It feels daunting sometimes.

Even though I've been away for months, I still feel severe PTSD. I can start remembering something that happened, and need to instantly throw up. I know the trauma is still there. I know it will take time to heal. But I feel like I'm losing my mind. Somehow, even with all the horrible stuff he's done, I can still remember the good times and have some sort of nostalgia over his good qualities. But the truth is, he is volatile, manipulative, and incredibly dangerous. I know that now.

I guess the feeling I'm dealing with now is that I can never recover mentally from this. I don't want to look at my future, like I'll be unable to find love again or even trust people. I don't want to be around anyone. I go home at night and watch TV with my cats. It's the only place I feel safe anymore. I don't know if I could ever trust a person again to let them in my heart - friend or whatever. I battle with being frustrated with myself for staying so long. And guilt that my cats were in such a horrible environment because of me. I love them more than anything. And it still haunts me - everything that happened.

I hope that this post can help someone in an abusive situation get the courage to get out. I was able to get out thanks to my family. I truly believe if I stayed, I would be dead by now at his hands. If you're in an abusive situation, there are a lot of people going through the same things. If you feel any kind of negativity about your partner/spouse or intuition telling you this person is very bad for you, please listen to it before it's too late.

Had a concerning experience at the gym today,"I’m a young mom (five months postpartum) and today a man walked up to me in the gym to say “you’re skinny now, that’s good, a few months ago you were like this” and with his hands gestured having a large stomach (I had a baby five months ago). He then proceeded to follow me around the gym trying to coach me on my workout then asked if I was in the gym because “females get depressed about how big they get when they have kids”. I genuinely didn’t know what to say and I’m not proud of it but I kind of just ignored him and now I am considering switching gyms because that is the third time in the last few months I’ve experienced harassment there to that level.

I want to crawl out of my skin after that interaction. How could I have handled this better and what can I do to avoid further situations like this? Like I said, I’ve had several instances of harassment at that gym now.

UPDATE- I reported the incident to the gym and they plan on having a talk with the guy about appropriate conduct in the gym so it should be resolved. In the meantime I’m gonna start learning to stop being so nice for the future.

neighbor having a crush on me ruining my life,"my (26f) older, married neighbor (60sm) and i had a weird interaction yesterday and it's making me fearful to leave my apartment and go on walks with my dog. 

this neighbor lives in the apartment building across from me, but i frequently take my dog out in that area because he doesn't like to use the bathroom near my apartment. this neighbor has a dog he walks that's befriended my dog so we talk occasionally. 

yesterday, i ran into this neighbor while walking my dog. he started following me to start a conversation, and was saying and doing a lot of weird things. this includes touching my hair because he ""liked the color of it"" and asking me if what i was wearing was what i wore to bed and that he ""usually wears nothing because it's so hot."" 

eventually i walked away but when i circled back to my apartment he appeared out of nowhere and wanted to continue the conversation. he started asking me what my car i drove and where it was parked and if i was ""happy"" because supposedly he saw me crying from my window (for context: my room faces the main street, so if you're absolutely looking through you can see my room - which i've noticed he does every time he passes by). he then asked me if i liked dancing and if he could take me out, which i thought was a joke. then he asked me about my boyfriend, who he's met a few times, and started going on a tangent about how he should ""be here with me more often"" and ""take me out more."" 

the real kicker was when he asked me for a hug and for my number so he could ""call me"" and i immediately told him ""no."" he called out to me and said it makes his heart happy when he sees me and i rushed back to my apartment. 

i've told my dad and my boyfriend about the interaction, and i'm considering talking to the man's son to ask him to tell his dad to lay off. but as someone who's been previous SA-ed and harassed, it gives me so much anxiety to be in situations like this to the point it's thrown my entire routine into a loop and i hate it.

A men pretended to chase me while I was on a run. I’m still really shaken,"I was on a run around 6pm on NYE. It was dark, but I stuck to residential lit streets in (what I thought was) a safe neighborhood.

I have 3 blocks left, and I pass a man who is walking in the same direction I was running. He turned around and shuffled, almost like how basketball players do when they’re playing defense. My stupid ass gave him the benefit of the doubt as I ran past— “oh I must have scared him coming from behind”. Nope, the man was pretending to grab me.

I keep running, glance over my shoulder and the man is RUNNING AFTER ME. I screamed and started sprinting, and he stopped and laughed at me, like it was the funniest joke in the world. I shouldn’t have done this, but I started screaming expletives at him.

I kept sprinting, on the verge of tears and luckily I ran into my neighbors walking who walked me the rest of the way to my door. I’m still really shaken, and needless to say I ordered some pepper spray to take with me running from now on.

It’s 2022, how do men not recognize that women’s safety is not a joke?

EDIT: I cannot thank you all enough for the support. Thank you so much for validating my feelings and helping me see I wasn’t overreacting.

I posted on the NextDoor app about this, and immediately received a comment and message from a neighbor saying she recognized his description, she had a run in with him one block from where he accosted me and about 5 minutes after on the same night, and that she called the cops. She said he was wasted and threatening. She asked me to please file a report. So tomorrow, I will be calling the Police and making a report so that they can have information about my interaction as well.

Turns out he lives one block up from me which is… terrifying. Looks like I’ll be driving elsewhere and avoiding running in my neighborhood for a while.

"To the woman who made sure I was okay, even though I was perfectly fine. Thank you.","My dad and I were walking on the street. We were speaking Portuguese, we naturally speak loud but we were having a somewhat heated conversation about someone and we were probably louder than usual. I was late at night, so you might not have seen the whole scene properly, but you probably saw an older man talking to a younger women loudly in a language that you didn't understand that has a harsh sound to it. 

What made you react was probably the fact that my dad does this ""elbow"" thing when he's proving a point. He will take his elbow and ""hit"" me with it. It doesn't hurt me at all, but I was wearing high heels and lost a bit of my balance when he elbowed me since I wasn't expecting it. He apologized and caught me but you were there. 

You came in running from behind saying ""hello, excuse me."" We turned around and you looked at me straight in the eyes and told me ""You look identical to this girl I went to high school with from behind. I'm pretty sure it's you, do you remember me?"" I was a bit confused, and told her ""uh..."" Before I said more she said ""Maybe it wasn't you. I'm not sure it's dark, but she was a good friend and there is nothing I'd like more than to reconnect with her."" I smiled and said ""I don't think it's me."" She just said ""Okay, cool, well my name is Emilie, and I can leave you my phone number if ever you remember me."" As she gave me a big smile. It clicked in my head, this girl was just making sure I was okay. 

I smiled back and told her that I got it now, and thanked her. I told her that I was okay and that I was talking with my dad about something that upset both of us in Portuguese. We laughed it off and she mentioned how harsh Portuguese sounds and we went separate ways. My dad didn't understand what happened and thinks it's some girl thing. We resumed our discussion as soon as she left. 

So to that Emilie Montreal woman who made sure I was okay, you did everything right. If I was in a situation where I was being vulnerable, you gave me many ways out. You've inspired me. Thank you.

“I’m going to call you to make sure you didn’t give me a fake number.”,"I used to take a city bus to and from High School when I was 14-17 years old (about a 2-3 hour ride depending on the day) and looking back on it, the amount of grown MEN who tried talking to me, flirting with me or following me is disgusting. I was taught to be polite as “we don’t know what that person is going through,” and because it was so instilled into me, I was extremely non confrontational about literally everything including standing up for myself. Most days, I got home by sitting with my bag in the chair next to me, blaring music in my headphones and ignoring anyone who tried talking to me. Some of those days, I didn’t have the small protection of my music because my iPod had died. That is apparently a good enough reason to talk to a child who clearly looks underage and who is clearly alone. 


I’ve had adult men tell me, “You’re really pretty,” or “You would look better without that makeup on.” Ive had them ask me to “hang out” and to “come over and smoke with them.” I’ve been offered to buy fake prescription scripts and to “go into Taco Bell’s bathroom real quick.” I honestly prefer when they talk and leave it at that when I laugh it off but when I’m sitting waiting for the next transfer bus to arrive, that’s when I would get nervous. I remember being 15 and a guy ran across a main road to walk beside me, asking me personal questions, my name, where I was going, where my home is, why do I have to pick up my sister when we could hang out? Even as I continued to walk to my destination he still followed right along next to me like a sadistic lost puppy. When he asked for my number, I gave it to him knowing it was fake (I hadn’t learned to say no at this point and was stupid and young), and you can imagine the sinking feeling I had when he told me he was calling it right then to see if I was lying about the number or not. Well, when my phone didn’t ring, guess who now knew about my lie? And guess who got angry about it? He did. An adult male got angry over a 15 year old giving out a fake phone number to a random man that ran across a busy street to her. My only way of calming down the situation which, I shouldn’t have had to do, was to give him my real number and tell him I forgot I had switched numbers recently. After he called it and made sure I showed him my phone screen to make sure the call went through, that is when he left me. 


It took me awhile to understand it’s okay to not be polite to everyone especially if you are alone. I still would give real or fake numbers out to appease the people who surrounded me at the time. I was always scared what the wrong person would do if I said no so I started saying, “I don’t give my number to strangers, I’m sorry.” It took me too long to realize how fucked up it is that we have to deal with fear and paranoid thoughts about what could happen just from simply taking a bus ride home. 


To anyone who needs to hear this, especially teenagers, stand up for yourself. If you’re uncomfortable and alone, try to find someone that could help you. You don’t have to be polite; you don’t have to be compliant with someone you don’t know. This part is a recommendation, if you see someone clearly in a predicament they don’t want to be in, help in your own way but assess the situation first. Please be safe out there.


Edit: Since this gained more traction than I thought, people in the comments have been saying Google Voice is a good workaround instead of giving out your personal number. This wasn’t around when this happened to me, but I recommend using that or a fake number generator app! (Text Free)

Restraining order against a colleague’s wife. 6 months of hell,"Front Page Edit: while I have your attention, I would like to stress how hard this process has been and that I have had to be a fierce advocate for myself and my family’s safety. I have wanted to just walk away and forget about it so many times. If you are going through something similar, stick with the process and see it through. Leveraging the legal system to help protect you is not cowardly - it is courageous. Self-defense is always an option you can explore but no matter what it’s not your fault and you do not need to resort to violence in order to regain your safety. 

If you know someone is being harassed or abused or worse, believe them. Support them. Be a resource to them. Help them work through the legal process even when it’s completely overwhelming and seems futile. 

**Post hearing update:** The judge granted a one-year restraining order. Thank you for all of the support and for sharing your stories. Who knew an insomniac’s musings would create so much interest? I am glad that this phase is over and I am anxious to move on with my life.

Wall of text below. But I cannot sleep and this is a story I want to share with other women. Thank you in advance for reading. 

About six months ago, my colleague’s estranged wife assumed we were having an affair and started stalking me. It is worth noting that we work at a university and live in a fairly small community. We also never had an affair but we were friends before this all started. 

She was already stalking him and when she found my phone number in his call logs, she turned her attention to me. Over the course of several weeks, she followed me home from work, found out which gym I go to, called my boss, called my HR rep, created multiple burner numbers to text and call me, created accounts in her husbands name and contacted me, and continually threatened to show up at my office and cause a scene. 

During all this time, I respond to her three times. Once to say she was wrong and to stop contacting me, once to tell her i was filing a police report, and once to say I was filing a restraining order if she contacted me again. 

These past months I’ve been unable to answer unknown numbers, every white SUV is a threat, bumps in the night jolt me awake, and i live in constant fear that I’ll be assaulted in my office. 

It took two months to serve her as she kept hiding and i ended up having to hire someone to do it. When we finally went to court 6 weeks ago, she did not show but her written statement delivered by her lawyer claimed it was a case of mistaken identity and she thought I was her husband’s other lover. Then her lawyer accused me of sleeping with her husband during Q&amp;A. The judge postponed her decision but did grant me a temporary restraining order. 

Today is what I hope is the final court date. Where hopefully this entire thing can be settled and done and I can get on with my life and start feeling secure again. I have so much anxiety that I won’t be able to explain the impact this has had on me and that the judge will throw it out since there hasn’t been any violence. 

Thanks for reading and making me feel slightly less alone. 


Edit 2:  Hello to the team at work. Pretty sure I just doxed myself.

"A little bit upset with the ""lonely, sexless 20's man""","Increasingly, I keep seeing posts, discussions and conversations around the new epidemic of the single, lonely, virgin or sexless man in his 20s'. I see it online, I see it in real life, and I for sure see it on Reddit.

This discussion bothers and scares me a lot, especially with the rise of anti-women/LGBTQ laws, and increasingly 1950's traditional extremism that's popping up more and more. I'm a 20 year old woman and I feel like whenever the discussion on alienation in your 20's is brought up, it only applies to men. Women cannot be lonely; we all have a ton of friends of course!

But I'm constantly lonely. I didn't have a support network for most of my life, and all of my friends either are so busy with their own lives, or are fair-weather. It looks like I have 15 or more, but only 3 are close friends, and only 1 will drop everything to come and help if I need help.  I can go weeks without seeing any of my friends; but since I'm a girl, I'm not included in the discussion on alienation. There's alienation where you are by yourself, but what being in a group and realizing that you're only here as long as you play your correct part? I can stick around as long as I'm funny, but if I ask for help with something serious, then I'm a burden. In class, I can't for the life of me make any friends. I had no friends in public school, and I've only made friends outside of my classes in college.

The thing is, those experiences? It's not limited by my sex or gender at all. It's a very human problem, so why is half of the population excluded from talks about it?

&amp;#x200B;

Of course men face different limitations because of the ideas drilled into their heads at a young age, but the outcome is the same. Why don't we talk about women who struggle with being alone and on their own in their 20's?

&amp;#x200B;

And I think this applies to the sexless part. I'm just going to say the quiet part out loud since I'm so tired of people skirrting around it; the ""solution"" for these sexless young men is for women to have sex with them, and become their gfs, wives, fwb, etc, etc. It feels like a huge backlash against the fact that women are now becoming independent and aren't tied to their husbands by their hands and feet legally, socially, and financially. If we ignore the fact that not only men are facing issues in the most turbulent time of our lives, we can construct a narrative that this is a man exclusive epidemic. Also, why is there such a huge fixation for men to have sex? I don't see this for single, unmarried women for them to go and have sex as much as possible. Sex isn't that big of a deal to not have, and its a bit creepy and sad that men are told that they need to have sex or else they're not manly enough, or that it's a pressing biological urge. My own father said that for young men, it's just different than for women when it comes to sex. That they need it more than women do. Doesn't that sound so sad? Life is so wonderful and lovely, but men have to have sex for it matter? At that point, are they even better than breeding bulls? We're humans, not dumb animals. Why would we expect men to have to behave like that? And where does that put women? If sex for women is different than sex for men, why do we need to give men that? No one is entitled to someone else's body for anything.

And this need and drive for sex is ironically, part of the reason that there are so many sexless single men who don't a lot of friends. I don't have a lot of actual friends, but I've been friended just because the person wanted to fuck me. I've had friends try and get me drunk to have sex with them, I've had men who, we got along super well, but they started to get creepy because they didn't want a friend. They wanted to have sex with me. That's so horrid for both parties! I want to be friends with everyone, but if I have to worried that a dude is only getting close to me because of what I can give him, it's heartbreaking.

This whole discussion is leading to the idea that we need to return to traditional gender roles because men can't function socially or without a sexual partner. But that thinking limits men, and punishes women. In all of these talks, women aren't seen as actual people unlike the men are. I don't see anyone saying, hey, where are all of the lonely women? How are they doing? What's going on with that? I don't see anyone treat them more than sex and socialization dolls for men. And the conversation babies men! It acts like they are no more than dumb animals that need to get their dicks wet and that no one will ever ever like, so they need to lash out; instead of seeing them as actual people!  This whole epidemic of the ""single, sexless 20 year old men"" is just so dehumanizing to both groups. We should talk about men's mental health, but the solution we're coming to is that women aren't suffering and that they need to start fucking these poor guys and become trad wives.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Frustrated with the focus on men only in lonely and sexless conversations, and the unspoken idea that women having sex and becoming their S/O's is the only solution, and that women aren't suffering as people either.

EDIT: A lot more people than I thought have read this post, and things I skimped on in detail for personal reasons are becoming a hot topic which bothers me. I've struggled with making friends my whole life; I was bullied in pre-k for God's sake. I wasted a decade of my life alone in my bedroom, not talking to anyone and feeling cut off from society. I tried to make friends following advice from other people, because I know what real loneliness feels like. I got some DMS that didn't think that I did, but I do. I know what it's like to go out to school for 8 hours everyday where people hate you for things you can't change, where they hate you for being award or having mental issues, they hate you for being poor,  and the wear and tear it is it look at a room and know that if they're thinking of you, it's at your expense. I had to leave my first high school because I was being bullied so bad I would wake up vomiting before class. In my second high school, I started to break down mentally at the end. Every week as a senior in high school, I would break down and have to go home. No one cared. None of my teachers thought that there was an issue with me crying and sobbing in my classes so often, none of the new, tentative friends who hadn't been picking on my for their entire school lives cared that I was having mental breakdowns next to them.

I am more akin to a dude in my manners; I do get angry and mean when I'm unhappy. The same things that worked for my male classmates to get help didn't work for me. No one seemed to care that I was so close to losing it all. That's why this whole thing bothers me. There's an idea that women don't really suffer from being alone, that they don't need to contribute to the conversation when it's brought up. I am one of those women who didn't have friends, who everyone thought was ugly because my family couldn't afford decent clothing, and who was mean and jaded because I was treated so badly. When I came to college, I was still so fucking lonely. I did course work, made no friends in my major, and slept an average of 4 hours each night. Even when I started to get this big group of friends, it doesn't really cancel out the lifetime of being isolated, nor does it mean that everyone is close to me. A friend to me is someone who I can hang out with and talk to. Out of that big old group, only one person really gives a shit when I'm in trouble. I don't even ask other people for help because we're not those types of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what it's like to literally have no one. I also know what it's like to have lots of people, but too know that if you don't play your part right, you'll be shamed and tossed out. Both are horrible in their ways; like how drowning and burning alive are. The whole point of this post was that this is an issue that is effecting everyone, but is only being applied to young men who don't have sex instead of the wide array of the population.

Men need to have their mental health taken seriously. I never said anywhere that all men deserve to suffer forever; in fact, I think the opposite! Wouldn't it be great if all men didn't have to operate underneath a system that treats them like animals that crave sex, but rather a system that treats them like smart people who can be wonderful, and amazing and alive. We can't make that system fair though in reality without also taking into account how women are treated though. Women are fighting all of the time for so many things - an issue that runs as deep as how society wants us to live together needs both sides not one. If we only care about how men are alone and sexless in an age where our lives are being torn apart, the path forward is one that hurts women and limits what men can be.

I know that this is Reddit and no one has any reading comprehension, but if you have beef with a point I make very, very early on, you might have the pleasant surprise of an answer that supports the point you want to argue about :D!

My creepy older male neighbor whom I've been avoiding reported me MISSING when he didn't see me for two days.,"UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xbwwpp/update\_my\_creepy\_older\_male\_neighbor\_whom\_ive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xbwwpp/update_my_creepy_older_male_neighbor_whom_ive/) (and below in comments). 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know how to feel about this, but hoping to get advice from women who can relate.

I'm mid twenties and moved into a quiet four unit apartment last May. Shortly after, the apartment opposite of me was rented out to an older gentleman who is retired, bold, and will trap you in a conversation. He made it clear that he did not like the tenants upstairs, and between his racist comments (neither parties are white, but are different races) and general untowardness, he did a great job at making them feel completely unwelcome in what had been their home for two years and the families quickly left. They claimed they were leaving because a different housing opportunity arose- I have no doubt he was a large, motivating factor. When they left, the only person left in the building were the neighbor and I.

He comes off friendly but in a clear ""I know you're too polite to say no"" way. Once he starts talking, he wont stop, despite any clear verbal or nonverbal attempts to leave. His door across from me is always open, and he is constantly in the front yard either talking to people or his dog quite loudly. I'm WFH, and least once a day, he knocks on my door, and if I don't answer he goes outside and rings my doorbell and knocks on my window, sometimes multiple times a day. I try my best not to answer and have to physically hide in my apartment to get him to stop.

I feel trapped in my own home. I typically don't leave, but when I do, he will either rush to his door to speak to me or already be outside, waiting. I feel like I'm being tracked. There are times that I leave or get home late in the night, and he is either standing in his window in the dark watching me, or rushes to the door to speak to me. I can't have guests over- He beats me to the door to great them. He's made several sexual comments to my mom (who's a good 30 years younger than him) and makes all my guests uncomfortable.

Several times he's mentioned details about the inside of my apartment that he should NOT know, which lead me to believe he'd been looking in my windows. That theory was proved when I actually did catch him SITTING IN A CHAIR facing my window- he was staring, watching me while I worked. I had to spend over $100 on privacy window coverings and now I never open my windows or blinds. And just icing to this cake, he likes to pay very loud music and talk loudly all day with his window, door, and our main apartment door open, so I can never escape him visually or audibly.

Last week, I was house sitting for a friend for two days. When I came home, he was outside and informs me that he had gotten worried and REPORTED ME MISSING to the property manager and the owner. He also stated that he thought it was ""that guy"" (my partner of three years) because he had shown up while I was gone and my neighbor wouldn't let him in the building. My partner has the codes and keys to the building and was stopping to feed my cats.

There is no way that my neighbor would know I was gone unless he looked in my windows repeatedly, since most of the day I work in the room farthest away from him and I already don't leave or open my curtains or windows.

I have already told the property manager that this man makes me uncomfortable, that I had caught him staring in my windows and am on the verge of feeling harassed. The property manager informed me that my neighbor is ""not all there"" and they placed him in this building because he felt the tenants ""wouldn't take advantage of him"". With him here, I doubt the upper units will be filled, since he's made it clear what people have waiting for them during tours.

On one hand, I don't know if I'm biased and reading too much into this situation. My family thinks he is lonely and just looking for conversation. On the surface he seems nice, and he has claimed several times that people attempt to get into our building for nefarious reasons that he's scared away, and I guess it's nice that someone would notice if I had gone missing. However, I feel creeped out, harassed, and fully uncomfortable. I'm stuck here for 8 months, most likely alone. I don't think I can set hard boundaries with him without drastic consequences to my quality of life.

"Sexist, insufferable boomer put his hands on my neck today.","I volunteer at a local animal shelter and there’s a very creepy old guy who volunteers there. Most other volunteers there are women who avoid him. I’m one of the only volunteers that speaks to him so he trusts me. (Keep your enemies close.) He has made a lot of wildly inappropriate comments to me, including calling another volunteer a bitch, and rude comments about a female staff’s body figure. He has even made comments to me about hating his wife who has Parkinson’s and is in hospice care. He’s asked me and my friend weird personal questions, like whether or not we are roommates, which felt so gross of him to ask, especially when it was followed by a question about my relationship status and then an inference about my sexual orientation.

Today, we were alone in the back and I was talking to him about something. I can’t remember what was said but it doesn’t matter because he made a face like he was angry and put his hands on my neck and pretended to choke me. Throughout the day, he made multiple comments about “women not being good listeners” and after hearing it several times I jokingly replied, “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that,” and he made this angry face and grabbed my hat off of my head.

The rest of the women there are totally passive and just avoid him or try to keep the conversations with him short. I’ve only volunteered for a few weeks but I’m ready to start collecting evidence and speak to other volunteers so I can file a report. He crossed a huge line today. The women who work there don’t deserve to feel uncomfortable, unsafe, harassed, or intimidated.

Reflecting back, I should have kicked him in the balls when he put his hands on my neck. If I ever have a daughter one day, she’s going to learn jiu-jitsu. If you have a daughter, niece, or a little sister, please consider enrolling her in self-defense and encourage her to fight instead of freeze if she is ever touched non-consensually. 

TL;DR Boomer who tests boundaries with women and makes sexist comments put his hands on my neck and pretended to choke me today. It is now my mission to get him banned from the shelter. Wish me luck.

I had a wholesome experience with a catcaller today,"I had something happen today which has never happened in my very long history of unwanted advances by groups of men when walking alone, it was so unexpected and wholesome that I felt like sharing.

I was walking on a busy street today when I was catcalled by two men passing me. This kind of thing usually happens at night when I’m by myself and already feeling unsafe, so I would usually ignore it and immediately walk in the direction of the nearest main road. But in broad daylight and with cars around, I felt confident enough to call him out and say ‘You shouldn’t say that to people, I think it’s rude’.

The catcaller of the two guys immediately escalated the situation, changing paths to approach me, raising his voice and asking ‘What, you don’t like a compliment? I’m not trying to pick you up or anything, I’m just telling you – ‘ etc.

I told him, ‘I don’t take it as a compliment, actually it makes me uncomfortable.’

The catcaller was still coming towards me and started to say something else, when the second guy stepped in and called him out, saying ‘She said she doesn’t like it, leave her alone’.

The catcaller turned back and started arguing with the second guy, who cuts him off, and apologises to me on his friend’s behalf, and they both leave.

It might seem like a little deal, but it meant the absolute world to me that a stranger would see a problem with his friend’s behaviour and call him out on it. In all my experiences of being catcalled by groups of men, I have never had a man intervene like this. 

Welp, that was my wholesome experience. Although I feel like I should add the disclaimer that I don't think it's any wom*n's job to teach men appropriate behaviour, especially in situations where doing so might put you at risk. This guy was much larger than me, and I was genuinely scared when he changed paths to come at me. Stay safe.

Edit: to the people who are confused or upset about my use of the term 'wom*n', I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I used this term to try to encompass all people whom identify as a woman and/or have lived experience as a woman, who have probably experienced feeling unsafe in similar circumstances. It's a term commonly used in circles in my area but it's been interesting to learn from this thread that it's not widely known.

To the woman at the gas station,"Thank you. It was 11:45 tonight, a Sunday, and the roads were pretty deserted. Me, being the procrastinator that I am, was on my last bit of gas and HAD to stop to make it home. I pulled into the nearest gas station and it was closed, but not a big deal as I had my debit card. I scanned the station and saw you pumping gas and immediately felt better as there was someone else with me at the empty and dimly lit station.

I got out, glanced around, being aware of my surroundings as my always paranoid mother taught me. We made eye contact and you gave me a comforting smile. I was typing in my pin number and noticed you closing your gas cap and getting into your vehicle. I didn't want you to leave. You were a stranger, you could have been a serial killer, but your smile and your eyes put me at ease. I felt safer with you around. 

You pulled away and went around the gas station and the minute you were out of sight, I was on alert. I kept checking my surroundings, wishing I hadn't picked the seeimingly slowest pump at this station. 

He came put of no where-- I was alone and then I wasn't. He wore camo pants and an oversized black hoodie, the hood up and shielding a lot of his face. I gripped my keys tightly in my hand, trying to get them between my fingers just in case. He asked for a ride, calling me ""sugar titties"" and winking. I quickly said, ""sorry, I have somewhere to be"" and wished I had sounded more confident as the words left my mouth. He persisted, yanking on the door handle of my passenger back door. I said ""no!"" again, this time, more forcefully. He kept laughing, like this was the most hilarious game in the world and tried my passenger door.

I froze. I'm not proud of myself. I should have jumped into the car and drove off. I should have had my cell phone in my hand instead of my car. I should have gotten gas that morning instead of the last minute. In everyday life, I'm typically a force to be reckoned with and strong and painfully independent. Why did I freeze? Why didn't I jump into action? Why did I act like a sitting duck instead of a ferocious lion? 

And then you came. You rolled up next to us in that boxy Element car that I used to complain about to anyone who would listen and you just rolled down your window, your phone in one hand, illuminating your face in the darkness. 

""I have 911 on the line. Take your chances or keep walking.""

He immediately put his hands up, shaking his head. A slew of curse words were said, including crazy bitch and he backed away. My eyes left him and moved to you. You simply nodded and drove away, not actually pulling out onto the street until you saw that I was safely in my car.

To the lady at the gas station,

Thank you. Thank you for being kind, for being strong, and for caring about a complete stranger that needed help. I can only hope that if I'm ever in such a situation again, I have the same strength and confidence you have.

I was married to a narcissist and didn’t realize it until I left him. Don’t make my mistakes.,"When I was a teenager I married my high school sweet heart. He was joining the military and had me convinced that if we didn’t get married I would never see him again. 

The red flags started when he told me he didn’t like friends A and B. We fought about them often, but they had been my best girlfriends since jr. high and I didn’t want to totally give them up.  “I’m just worried about who they hang out with , I’m worried about your safety, they’re not good friends they don’t want us to be together” he said. 

We moved several states away from our hometown and then things got progressively worse. I had my belly button pierced wanting to surprise him thinking it was sexy. “Why did you that? You didn’t ask me! You changed your body without talking to me first” I got confused and upset saying it was a surprise for him since he had said they were attractive, then he said “it’s ok hun, I forgive you, you just need to ask me first.” I felt ashamed that I didn’t realize that “I needed to ask him first” what a bad wife I was already I had thought. 

The first time he showed his true temper was when I folded the towels wrong. I had mixed in the blue towels with the white towels. He wanted them separate.  “I’m trying so damn hard to give you nice things! And you can’t see that!” He yelled, standing the doorway before storming off. “This looks terrible you can’t mix them!”  I cried, but brushed it off as he’s just stressed from work. 

He told me he didn’t want me to go to college in town like we had discussed before we got married. “I might get transferred you can’t go to school you need to be with me” he had said. I agreed. So I worked and saved money for school whenever that would be. 

He was happy I had made friends. But then he would become angry when I would go have girl time. “I just fucking miss you ok? I work so hard for you and I want to see you when I get home” He would yell at me. So I skipped seeing friends to avoid fights. 

I wanted to fly home to visit my parents for a few days. We were driving down the highway and it was brought up and he started screaming at me “Don’t you think I want to go see my family too?! And you’re leaving me here!” His face was beat red and he had pulled into an empty parking lot to yell more. This time I was so scared I didn’t say anything and just silently cried. 

We went to the beach with friends. When we left, he told me I was “too quiet today” and how dare I embarrass him in front of everyone. “Dan asked me why you were so quiet asked what’s wrong with you?!” He screamed at me as we were driving home, I cried, he pulled over at an ice cream shop and got me my favorite cone. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to make you cry. I just don’t want to you be moody around our friends. It’s embarrassing.” I hadn’t realized I was being quiet, I’ll have to try harder next time, I thought.

He would pick fights with me about the dishes or putting groceries away wrong, and I eventually didn’t have the strength to fight back. I would try to hide in the bathroom hoping he’d calm down, but he would follow me and pound on the door threatening to break it down. “The housing people will be pissed if I break this door down you’d better open it before that happens”

He convinced me to let go of my access to our bank account and let him handle everything. “It’s stressing you out just let me handle it” he said. From then on out I needed his log in and password to sign in, which he kept changing. Making me come to him with questions about our finances. 

It was so confusing because he would shower me with affection and grand gestures making me believe we were soul mates. But then he would yell at me for “doing something wrong.” 

I never spoke to anyone about it. I was afraid they wouldn’t believe me and I didn’t fully know how to explain it because he was so charming and everyone loved him. “I wasn’t being a good wife I must be doing something wrong” I would think. I didn’t know that his behavior wasn’t normal, I thought I was a bad wife and started to become massively depressed without fully understanding why. 

The tipping point was when we was screaming at me about wanting to go out with my friends. I was pressed into the couch holding back tears and I got up to walk away to lock myself in the bedroom. But he stepped in front of me and pushed me back into the living room. I left the house. I went for a walk. When I came back he apologized saying “I just love you so much. You need to spend your time with me ” 

I pushed to go back to college and demanded that he let me sign up. That’s when he admitted that he had spent the fifteen thousand dollars I had saved up working at shit fast food job before we got married. “You can’t go there’s no money but I swear I’ll earn it back.” He had lied to me for years about how much was in savings, making me think I had even more than before we had gotten married. 

We fought a lot. I suggested we go to counseling, he fell asleep during a session. He never really listened to what I was saying and would tell me my feelings were wrong and why he was right after we would leave the counselors office. Overtime, if I “did something wrong” he would yell at me about how his family thinks we should just divorce since I was being so difficult such a bad wife, but that he loved me too much to do that. 

I stayed with him for three years before I got the nerve to leave him and at that point I was absolutely terrified of him. He got an assignment over seas (not deployment, just an assignment) and I took the opportunity to leave him. I felt like a terrible person for leaving him while he was away, like a complete coward, but I was so scared he wouldn’t “let” me leave and scared he would make it physical. 

My new friends didn’t believe me when I tried to explain what had been happening, he was so funny and sweet after all. He spread rumors that I was partying and cheating on him and that destroyed all of my relationships with my friends and acquaintances. He got his friends to spread rumors about me so much so that at one point I had a total stranger ask me at my work if I was “that whore at (my job on base)that was screwing around on her husband”. And he even managed to tarnish my reputation in our very small hometown, cutting some already small ties. He refused to sign the divorce papers, keeping me trapped in limbo for almost an entire year. Pulling power grabs and making false promises. But once it was finalized I was so fucking relieved I didn’t care that I was basically alone and had almost no one. 

Not even my family fully believed me, “him? No he’s so nice, maybe you could have tried harder. I don’t believe he would yell at you for stuff like that.” 

So if you’re still reading, after this long long post, I just want to say please don’t repeat my mistakes. If you feel like something is off, do not brush it aside or continuously make excuses for someone’s bad behavior. If someone is showering you with affection then screaming at you or putting you down over small things, that’s not love. That’s not love at all that’s control and a power grab. It wasn’t until years later that I saw an episode of some show featuring a narcissist husband when I realized that’s what I had been experiencing and I just wish I had know about those types of twisted behaviors when I was that dumb kid back then, it might have saved me from a very dark period in my life.",TwoXChromosomes,10753,1563672053.0,484,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/cfthln/i_was_married_to_a_narcissist_and_didnt_realize/
Bears. ,"I get this is a trending thing. I get a lot of people are tired of it. I get that a lot of people are glad the conversation is happening. I get that a lot of people have a lot of feelings about it. As for me, I’m burning with rage.

A bear has never told me that it forgot I was a person.

I’ve never told a bear it harmed me, caused me mental and emotional pain and argued that it didn’t. 

A bear has never shown up at my apartment in the middle of the night and refused to leave “until it got to fuck me”.

A bear did not park 3 blocks away from a clinic and let me walk to and from in 90 degree weather because it did not want to be seen with me, even though if the bear had put me in that position. 

A bear has never required me to do it’s laundry, clean up after it, prepare it’s meals, organize it’s social calendar, make it’s doctor’s appointments, find it’s missing keys, cover it’s bills, plan it’s vacations, organize it’s budget, and then feel entitled to be inside my body while failing to remember my middle name. 

A bear has never forbid me from closing the bathroom door when I take a shower. 

A bear has never blocked me from leaving until I gave it a kiss.

A bear has never scolded me for being hungry after a 12 hour shift. 

A bear has never met me for a first date, and when I said I was not going to be physically intimate, pushed me against my car and pinched my inner arm hard enough to leave a black and blue bruise while shouting about what a stupid bitch I was. 

A bear has never messaged me out of the blue “K👁️LL YOURSELF SLU✝️” “Go f*ck a goat, wh*re” 

I do not have a collection of screenshots of lewd, unprompted, unwanted messages from a bear. 

A bear has never touched me while I was sleeping, in our shared bed, in our shared home, and become enraged with me when I said “Please stop.” It was not a bear that then insisted I sleep on the couch and ignored me for days.

A bear has never followed me to my car, memorized my car and schedule and left terrifying notes and gifts on it. 

A bear has never caused me humiliation, and certainly not intentionally because it could not handle being turned down for a relationship. 

A bear has never told me it loved me, then dismissed every feeling or need I had. 

I have never asked a bear if it could just treat me like it liked me, and responded with “you don’t deserve that.”

A bear is not the reason I fear relationships, and have mistrust in others. 

A bear has never shown up at my workplace, threatened to harm me, then returned and exposed itself to me and my underage staff.

A bear was not the one, who when I was young and experimented with alcohol, waited for me to pass out. It was not a bear that was a decade older than me, fresh from military duty, that used my mouth to pleasure himself while I was unconscious. It was not a bear’s hair I pulled out of my braces. 

A bear was not what caused me to spend my 31st birthday in court, because it saw me through a window and decided to return every day, making threats and throwing canned goods at me.

A bear has never choked me.

A bear has never shoved me, especially during a session with a photographer. 

A bear has never lied to me, has never allowed me to plan a birthday weekend for it, then immediately cheat on me with its ex after its surprise party.

A bear has never dismissed and argued when I tell it I do not get drunk with bears.

A bear has never accused me of being disloyal because another bear said hello to me. 

A bear was not the one that pulled a 🔫 on my best friend when he found out she was going to leave. 

When my best friend needs help going through family pictures, I am not there because I’m filtering out photos of a bear that harmed her. 

My aunt was not left in financial peril because a bear refused to pay child support, emptied the accounts, and left the country. 

A bear has never brought a 🔫 into schools. 

A bear was not the force that kept my grandmother from making her own financial choices until the 1970s.

A bear did not intentionally hit my car because the location tracker it wanted me to have was off by a street.

A bear has never said “Grab em by the 🐈”

A bear has never thrown anything at me.

A bear has never commented on my weight.

A bear has never denied me a raise that I had earned because another bear should be buying me dinner. 

I have never had to ask a bear to leave me alone, give me space, respect my boundaries, don’t grab my body, don’t text me, don’t try to drunkenly lift my skirt. 

A bear is not seeing this question be posed and get defensive.

A bear is not going to pressure me to be in a relationship when I keep saying no, and if I happened to meet a different kind, caring, respectful bear later on, the first bear probably wouldn’t start texting me about what a bitch I was rather than consider that being an adult bear who cannot drive, cannot pay his bills or do laundry, reeks of cat urine, gets blackout drunk and violent, lives in filth, and lacks emotional intelligence might be why I would rather talk to the other bear. 

A bear has never approached me in public and ask “Can I just sit and stare at you?”

If I should choose to legally join this bear “for better or worse”, I would not have to consider that statistically, my lifespan will be shorter and I will be unhappier than if I remained alone. While the opposite, statistically, for the bear would be the case. 

I’ve never had a bear intentionally do a task wrong so that I would just do it for them. 

A bear was not who chose to keep playing a video game when my friend fell down the stairs while carrying their newborn and then complained about being interrupted by her crying. 

It was not a 40 year old bear that snatched my 15 year old cousin off the sidewalk when she walked home. It was not a 40 year old bear that kept her in a tent in the woods across state lines when she was found.

A bear has never taken my jokes for their stand up comedy routine, then told me that women aren’t funny. 

A bear is not the reason my social media profiles are completely un-searchable.

A bear is not the reason I tell people to never share my contact information.

A bear was not the one that pushed my friend out of a moving vehicle because another bear liked her social media posts. 

A bear was not the one that put bruises on my employee. 

A bear was not the one that got my childhood friend out of being homeless, but instead hooked on hard drugs and tattooed his name on her face.

A bear never has cornered me on the street.

I could go on. I really could. It’s just never been a bear in my experience.

"Men with thin skin are dangerous: Ignored a guy at a stoplight. He reacted with threats, throwing unknown liquid on my car","Pulled up to a light. Had my radio on and the windows down. Chillin, just doing my own thing.

I'm a racially ambiguous-looking woman, in a very diverse city, so I've unfortunately been on the receiving end of what I call the ""Magic 8 Ball"" of multilingual street harassment of both the racial and seal varieties -- Everyday it's really a mixed bag whereby I get to both cringe AND amuse myself by deciphering both what language I am being street harassed in as well as whether the harassment is of a sexual or racist nature. Usually, a little bit of both, depending on neighborhood.

So this dude at the light starts off with his petty driveby street harassment through my passenger window. Not wanting to get into a confrontation or acknowledge him, I remain stoic -- I don't look over, I don't turn up my radio, I just pretend it's the wind. 

I realize this isn't a strategy that's working when he just gets louder. It became obvious he wasn't taking kindly to being ignored by a random woman at a stoplight. He just got louder AND ANGRY. He unloads a barrage of crazy and looks to be unbuckling his seat belt, presumably to exit the car for this perceived INSULT of not acknowledging this fucking douchewad. I see the driver side door crack open and a foot step out. Not good for me.
 
Changing tactics, I turn my head to stare this loser in the eye while I roll up my windows. I'm at the front of line at a left turn at a 5 point intersection. It's afternoon rush hour daylight. I figure, if I'm about to be attacked, I may as well be as visible as is humanly possible, because really, what are my other options? So I just start flashing my brights, honking my horn, and seeing a squad car a few cars deep in another direction, I just make a giant fucking scene. A GIANT FUCKING LOUD FLASHING SCENE.

Fucktart in lane 2 stepped back in his car, closes the door, and I see him pour something into a cup and he throws it at my car windshield. (Later, I find out its antifreeze). The light changed, so I sped off hoping to blend into traffic and I realize this dude has made an illegal turn to follow me. 

I see a bunch of LAPD vehicles swarming a curb ahead, pull up behind one of them, and just park. 

As racially ambiguous looking female, I realize immediately that fuck, this is very obviously the least worst move on my part. It's a terrible idea to pull up and stop a car behind an LAPD squad car while said officers are conducting whatever business they're doing, while not-obviously-white-looking. But it's also a preferable state of affairs than being chased down and likely assaulted by Fucktart From Lane 2 because its rush hour traffic in LA, and any attempts to evade this psycho will be cut short by being penned in by traffic, making me a sitting duck. I rolled down the window and yelled to one of the cops that some guy was chasing me by car, gave a description, and asked if I could just park my car near their cars for a minute until he moved on.

So that's what I did. And that was just fine, I went home after a few minutes. The cops were obvi, very busy and not going to give chase or take a report. The officer I spoke to gave the others a quick heads up as to why I was parked there and went about his business.

All of this happened because of some dude with thin skin felt ignored by someone with a vagina. Which is alarming, on so many levels. 

Some dude at a stoplight, some orange near-dude in a not-quite circular office... this shit needs to stop. Nobody is entitled to my attention. It shouldn't be that serious, until some thin skinned fool decides to make it a problem. Then it becomes everyone's problem. Which is sad and terrible.

EDIT:::: Last Comments from me about this whole post. https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6n8jjm/men_with_thin_skin_are_dangerous_ignored_a_guy_at/dk83g42/

I, generally, don't fear the police. Obviously, if I did, I wouldn't have parked a safe distance from several squad cars while waiting for the creeper to drive away and leave me alone. HOWEVER, once I parked, I realized these *particular* LAPD squad cars and officers were actively working on something a lot more serious. As such, it made a LOT of sense to be both self-aware, and mindful that this *same* LAPD has a long and storied history of shooting first, then asking questions later, and usually those shot are minorities. I wasn't hesitating to report the incident, and the cop I spoke to seemed understandably anxious and occupied, not at all what I'd describe as ""dismissive"". The squad cars' presence was due to something totally unrelated. Stop PM'ing me to claim I'm ""anti-cop"" or ""being a victim."" LA is a great city with a lot of amazing people. With that comes some exceptionally shitty people of all stripes. UGH RIP my inbox.

A primer for Nice Guys(TM). (Trigger warning: LOTS of bad language),"TL;DR: if you're not part of the solution, you **are** part of the problem.  Full stop.

This is for the men lurking in this sub - the ones looking for women to pounce on, the ones looking to start an argument, the ones genuinely here to try and break through the veil of toxic masculinity and misogyny drowning them.  Any men who want to read it.

One of the most common addenda I see on this sub - on any women-centric sub, and often on others - is something to the effect of ""Edit: okay, yes, not all men are doing the problem I'm complaining about.""  So many men come here in bad faith to argue, ""Well, **I'm** not like that, so your argument is invalid,"" or ""what are you talking about, I've never seen this happen,"" or any one of a hundred other bullshit arguments aimed specifically at invalidating what we're going through.

So, I'ma break it down for you.

When women bitch about men doing something awful, the reason they have a tendency to generalize... the reason so many of us become misandrists... is because enough men subject us to their bullshit to make it a **statistically likely outcome**.  If nine out of ten men hit on us and don't take no for an answer, we're going to assume that tenth one will as well - we simply can't afford to take the risk of giving them the benefit of the doubt.

\- If you're paying a woman a compliment, because you're expecting reciprocation?  That's not nice - that's manipulative.

\- If you're being a woman's friend in hopes that she'll ""notice you,"" or put out, or accept you as a lover?  You're not being her friend - you're deceiving her in the hopes of using her.

\- If you won't accept no for an answer when you shoot your shot?  You aren't looking for a partner - you're looking for a possession.

\- If you touch a woman without an invitation, and get butthurt when she has a problem with it?  She's not being rude - she's protecting herself.

\- If the fact that a person has a feminine gender role changes your perception of their worth, regardless of their other accomplishments?  You're a bigot.

\- If you're standing around keeping your mouth shut when someone catcalls us, or makes a rape joke, or fires off a sexist comment, or touches us inappropriately?  You're perpetuating the issue.

\- If we act like you're doing something creepy?  *It's because you're doing something that comes across as creepy.*

I cannot stress this enough, guys: ***romantic comedies LIED to you***.  We act horrified when you follow us, because it's **statistically probable** you're following us for malevolent reasons.  We get scared when you won't back the fuck off, because it's **statistically probable** it's going to escalate into something unpleasant, and highly possible it'll escalate into something potentially **lethal**.

And when it does, the odds are overwhelmingly high that - at best - we'll have to go through miles of shit just to hold you accountable, if we're lucky enough to get anyone to listen at all, if we're lucky enough not to be blamed for somehow instigating someone else's vile behavior, if we're lucky enough to survive.

If you want to prove you're one of those #notallmen?

\- Take no for an answer and walk the fuck away.

\- Give us our personal space.

\- Judge us on our accomplishments, not our fuckability.

\- If you're absolutely intent on barging into our day to compliment us, compliment us on clothing choice, or skill, or our makeup, or **something** we have control over.

\- Most importantly, call your fellow man out when he acts like a jackass.

Nice guys exist.  They're out there - I've met several.  But for every one genuinely good guy I meet, there are a dozen other casually misogynistic pigs who either don't understand why we have a problem with their behavior - or worse, they understand perfectly and don't care.

And for love of the gods, if you meet a woman whose default posture is ""you're a scumbag until proven otherwise,"" take a deep breath and think about **why** they're so fucking scared.  Because, gentlemen?  Too many of you are acting the fool for us to take the risk that you, specifically, are one of the good ones.

**Edit**: cleaned up the formatting and wording a bit.

**Second edit**: over half of the responses are from men, as predicted.  To add to the above list of misconceptions we apparently need to correct: if you're posting a response that doesn't contribute anything more to the conversation than ""Here's my opinion from a guy's perspective, which is a different take on what you're saying,"" *please just shut the fuck up and let the women's sub be a women's sub.*

\- We don't need to know all the ways you, personally, are complying with the list.

\- We don't need to know how much you disagree, or how wrong we are for thinking this way.

\- We don't need virtue signaling or a categorical list of mitigating circumstances that ""explain"" why men act like jackasses.

Just watch, learn, and move on with your lives, instead of giving us several paragraphs of virtue signaling, or trying to veil yet another #notallmen response in disingenuous ""support.""

**Third and** (apparently not) **final edit**: obligatory ""holy hell, this exploded, RIP inbox"" edit.  To my sisters: thanks for your support.  To my brothers adding their support as well: at least you're trying - now go out and make it a reality.  To the bad-faith arguments, misogynists, trolls, strawmen, and brigadiers: die mad, you salty bitches.  We're tired of your crap.

**Fourth edit**: So, DMs blew up, thread derailed by the crap I explicitly mentioned in the post, a tsunami of #notallmen bullshit in both public and private, etc.  This, I expected and braced for.

What I didn't expect was being reported to r/RedditCareResources as a suicide risk.  For reference, folks?  Yes, I'm salty about the subject matter listed above.  Yes, I'm probably more than a bit depressed.  No, I'm not going to self-harm because boys called me names on the internet.

"I watched the guy who just targeted me go after another girl, and this time I did something.","He stood the wrong way around in the crowded elevator and kept exhaling hard, and I kept seeing him looking over at me out of the corner of my eye. The vibe was that he was either angry or on drugs; as we exited the elevator he elbowed me out of the way -making significant physical contact - and kept looking back at me as we moved toward the platform. I'm a six-foot-tall woman with a confident stance, so it felt like he was looking for a fight. I avoided eye contact, made measured movements, and moved away from him first chance I could. I figured I'd seen the last of him as we boarded the tube, especially since I change lines in the middle of my commute.

But just as we pulled up to my destination a girl came moving all the way through the crowded carriage to get away from someone, and there he came following her. She was clearly distressed and the people around noticed something was off, but I was the only one there who would have recognized the guy.

As the doors opened I took her arm and told her to follow me, just with the intention to separate them and put her on the next train. Instead, he followed us off and kept moving into our personal space, not going away even after I stepped between them and told him to leave. That's when another older woman got involved and came along with us as we all went looking for staff to intervene, with him stumbling along behind us continuing to pursue his target. At this point it's clear he's on drugs - he clearly doesn't recognize me from earlier and isn't registering that other people are getting involved now.

We made it up to station staff (male) and informed them that the man who's still trying to get too close to us has been harassing women on the tube. It's finally at this point that he got spooked and ran off, through the barrier and disappearing out into the night. We weren't sure if it's because it was a uniform or a man who got through to him, but apparently three women saying 'no' wasn't enough to break through his haze.

I'm disappointed that the station staff wasn't able to detain him fast enough because now he's out there and probably picked another woman to go after, but I'm glad another woman was ballsy enough to join in and make us into an impromptu guard.

I've tried to help her, I've begged her to come to my door if she or her son needs anything, I've told her that I will fucking THROW DOWN to protect her, and I DON'T FUCKING BLAME HER FOR NOT TAKING ME UP ON THAT.

Of course she doesn't, because who can she really trust to protect her?

No one...fucking no one...

This is the fucking world. And I am so fucking angry...

Sorry for any typos, I am still crying, and am stupid and don't know how to post stuff to reddit.

Edit:
Called the line, going to bed...I don't know what I'm going to do to myself if those people show up and leave and I listen to her die through the fucking wall...

Edit 2:
Woke up not long ago, she triggered my cameras by walking right by all of my windows (I gave her explicit permission to come to my door/use my yard already, I'm glad she feels comfortable taking me up on that at least). I watched her pack up an SUV I didn't recognize and leave.
I hope she stays the fuck away from the guy next door, and keeps the kid away too. 
I feel much better about taking aggressive action against him too, making sure that the child never enters that home again if I can...

I haven't read any new comments yet, I REALLY don't post on reddit, and 200 comments is a bit overwhelming. I'm going to shower, get dressed, scope the house next door, buy an energy drink, and come back to this. I assume most of the comments are worried for this poor woman, and I thank you all so much for being concerned, she deserves to have someone give a shit about her wellbeing, I plan to talk to her and offer whatever help I can if she comes back.

Edit 3: 
Had a friend (u/QuietPersonality) read the comments for me and give me the gist/resource suggestions. My anxiety got the best of me in this whole online situation and I am prioritizing the actual situation. I have emailed my therapist and asked them for resources that I can give her if I see her again, and who to call to have something done about the neighbor that is still there/ to make sure that the child is safe.
Thank you all for your comments, I will read them when I am ready to, but I'm going to prioritize my infant neighbor's safety, then his mother, then my own because there is no way the man living there still doesn't know that I called the police, and he has been stomping around all day. 
I am also going to grab all of the security camera footage that I have of any of them in the event that it is needed.
I live in a pretty poor area, but I wear a utility belt instead of having a purse, and it is a pretty good deterrent, my father-in-law is also only 5 minutes away and would show up faster than the police if I'm home alone and feel unsafe.
I will provide updates if there are any.



EDIT 4:
She came back today.
I couldn't catch her, I was in the arms of a man that owned my dog for the first 10+ years of his life and is facing that dog dying (As am I, but I took him in knowing I was going to be his luxurious retirement home).
I made eye contact with her, she looked down and avoided further contact as she walked quickly into the house.

I had an abortion and my fiance is pressuring me for sex before I'm ready,"I'll try to make this short.
My fiance &amp; I live together,  been dating 3 years. We are both 30s ish. I have a job I love, but recently have decided id like to move on from. We live in a college town.  Abouta year and a half ago I made the decision to finish my BS in engineering (one more semester left).  My first semester back was hard, especially working 30 hours a week, but I was determined.  I take birth control pill form.  SO hates his job and decided to pursue a second BS. A month into my second semester of school I get preggo.  I'm so upset.  I have made changes in my life to make it better (go to school) and now this.  I tell fiance and that I don't want to keep it.  He is a little disappointed, but agrees we both aren't ready yet (this happened before we got engaged).  The nearest clinic is 1.5 hrs away.  I do the entire process by myself. He doesn't ride with me, he doesn't sit in the wai ting room with me.he doesn't pick up any Rxs. He doesn't even stay home the night I took the pills.  In fact, his friends came to the house when I had planned to take them.  
That whole situation completed and I am okay from it. However, I feel like I went through everything alone. He didn't even Google what I had to do.  He has no idea except the Information I give him.   They tell you not to have sex for so many weeks after.  After like 2 weeks, I'm still bleeding a crap ton and he's moping around the house because I won't have sex with him.  He's not saying it but I feel like he thinks I should at least blow him or something. I tell him it's health reasons and they say not to.   But honestly,  I'm irritated that he's even being this way.  After time goes by, we eventually have sex again.  I had started back in the pill, but didn't tell SO.  He doesn't even pull out. 
We never talked about why we ended up in this situation,  what we can do to avoid it again, if we should start using condoms with the pill, why I don't want to have a kid right now,  when we would both be okay with having kids,  etc. I feel completely disrespected in the fact that he hasn't tried to talk to me about any of this. Whenever he came inside me I said ""what the fuck!?"" And he's like ""oh, I'm sorry, do you want me to get you plan B?"" No,  MF, you take plan B! Do you even know how bad it sucks to take that stuff? Much less get an abortion? By myself??? 

Since all of this has happened I can't bring myself to have sex with him. I feel violated and that he doesn't even know it. He brings up that we don't have sex and he doesn't feel attractive. He makes it about him when it's about me.  I don't want to have sex with someone who can't consider someone else.   and then there's the fact of if I went through that alone, how would an actual pregnancy have gone? I want to tell everyone in the world the thoughts I'm having and why I'm angry but I don't want everyone to know my situation. We have sex like maybe a few times in a month.  He doesn't make me feel sexy because I immediately get anxiety about feeling preggo.  When he mentions it, I say, ""can you maybe think of the reason why I might be scared to do it?"" And he pretty much shuts up. So instead of talking and yes, arguing,  the conversion stops there. 

Enough time has gone by that I am ok with leaving the relationship. I want him to understand me and he doesn't.  Plain and simple.  He doesn't want to or can't idk.  I feel very trapped. I don't really have money to move right now,  although it probably won't take, me long to save.... this semester I had to work a lot less and focus on school, but it's almost over.  Any encouraging word would help, I feel like I know what I need to do I just need some help.",TwoXChromosomes,4589,1509896430.0,1266,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7ay88n/i_had_an_abortion_and_my_fiance_is_pressuring_me/
"Incel comes up to me at bus stop, asks if he's repulsive","So I'm chilling at the bus stop at a pretty busy station in my city. A compleeeetely average-looking guy in his early-mid twenties comes up to me and we have the following exchange. (The convo has been translated.)

Him: Hi, can I ask a question?

Me, thinking he wanted directions: Yeah, sure! :)

Him, with the resting bitch face of quiet anger: .......Do you think I'm ugly??

At this point I immediately knew. I didn't want to say ""no"" because I felt like this was shaping up to be a leading question. So I said nothing, I just kind of blinked like that blonde guy in that gif.

Him: Is there something wrong with me? Am I *so* repulsive??

At this point, a random homeless person enters the convo, asking for change. I suddenly felt really unsafe because the guy looked angry, suppressed anger but anger nonetheless. So I got up and started walking, leaving him with a very insistent homeless person.

I looked back to see if he was coming after me. He leaned to look over the homeless guy's shoulder and called after me sarcastically, ""Thanks...! Thanks a lot!""

This happened months ago. I just told my sister the story and to my surprise, she said the same thing happened to her at a different station, a more empty one and at 2AM to top it all off. She described a different guy than the one I met, meaning there's a network of incels in my city going up to women and opening with ""Do you think I'm ugly"".

Just wanted to share, I wonder if this is a thing in other places, too.

**Edit:**

I don't want to be crushing you guys' ideals but I don't think the homeless person was aware of what was going on, he seemed pretty damn out of it. I'm not saying this to say homeless people **can't** **ever** be aware of what's going on or they can't ever benevolently intervene, but it certainly didn't seem to be the case. There are a LOT of beggars in this area and this man happened to waddle over there, I'm not trying to spin this into a heartwarming story of a homeless savior because it simply wasn't, honestly. This was a story of a poor guy wanting change and an insecure guy probably thinking he had it worse than the homeless guy and a scared woman wondering what even to say and that was it.

Frankly, from looking at the homeless people in my area, I doubt that their first priority would be to intervene in such cases, they simply look too miserable to do so. They look like they're in pain, some of them act like they're high on either relaxants or stimulants. The person in question seemed high on relaxants to me (or he simply haven't had anything to eat, I don't know). From witnessing the entire scene I firmly believe he just wanted change. I don't want this to read like a feel-good story, it simply wasn't, unfortunately. Nobody came to save me OR the homeless guy. It was an all-around indecipherable exchange by three strangers, nothing came of it except for this post.

**Edit2:**

I deliberately Googled the title of this post to see if it has shown up on incel forums these past 12hrs. It has, although it's only gotten a couple comments, but they've been saying that I made this up. Well I haven't. Only I will know that forever, they can never know for sure.

I broke up with my abusive boyfriend three years ago and it still haunts me,"I started dating him senior year of college. I already had a job in a city 4 hours away. He didn't have a job yet but found one close to where I would be. We graduate, move there and get separate apartments about an hour away from each other. 

He doesn't like spending nights by himself, so we spend almost every night sleeping over at each other's apartments, but he doesn't like long commutes, so 90% of the time we stay at his place. I get an hour commute every morning, he gets a 15 minute commute. 

He likes to play video games, but I'm not really a fan. Too bad, we can't possibly do separate things, we love each other and should want to be together all the time. I spend most of my nights watching him play video games.

He demands we text each other all throughout the day. My work doesn't like me to be on my phone. I find a way to appease him by using an internet browser messaging service. I'm expected to answer him within 60 seconds. If I mess up, it's because I don't love him enough. I have to tell him when I'm leaving my desk so he doesn't ""get sad waiting for me to respond.""

If we don't ""connect"" well enough over the day, he will want to ""eat dinner alone."" Which means he will pick up fast food on the way home, and then spend the rest of the night completely ignoring me. But I'm still required to watch him play video games. I just have to do it in silence while he seethes at me from the other end of the couch. If I don't follow the normal night schedule, I am showing him how ""I don't care enough to make it up to him."" Except I don't understand what I did wrong and what I need to make up to him.

I learn to manage his emotions. I know what will set him off and how. I hide things from him. I went out to lunch with my coworkers today, but he had packed my lunch the night before? I make sure I throw out the reciept where he won't find it. I even dump the lunch he made me so I can bring home an empty container. But this doesn't work all the time, because when something happens that's out of my control, it's still my fault and I get punished. 

He breaks up with me at least one a week. He gets so angry that he ""just can't handle all the stress I put him through."" But I know he doesn't mean it. It's my job to talk him down. I apologize and tell him everything is my fault and I will fix it in the future. We do this so often, I start to believe it.

I call my friends crying a lot. Am I a bad person for doing [insert latest argument] to my boyfriend? They get tired of having the same conversations with me. ""Just break up with him."" But how could I? I stop calling them. I worry they are judging me. They think I'm weak or stupid for staying with him. They don't understand.

He starts getting resentful. He doesn't like the city that I picked. He doesn't like his job. He doesn't have any friends here. He nitpicks at my life to show me how I shouldn't like my job either. He constantly tells me that my friends ""just don't seem like my people"". I have to run any after-work events by him. He usually finds excuses for me not to go. ""But babe, we planned on going to the grocery store tonight. You can't make me do that by myself. Don't you love me?"" Don't I love him?

He starts suggesting we move. He reminisces about his hometown. It's so much nicer than this city. His parents would be so happy if he moved back. He has friends there. Our lives would be so much better there. I'm not sure. But ""I don't like my job so it shouldn't be hard for me to leave."" 

We both find jobs near his family. Mine starts in August, but he doesn't have a start date yet. He tells me to move up anyway. He will be up there soon. So I move up and start my job. He comes up every weekend. We spend time with his friends and his family. He is very happy.

Except now it's September and October and he still doesn't have a start date. He calls the company every week, but they are waiting on his background check. There is nothing he can do but wait. He does not take that well. It's my fault. Did I tell the company something that would delay his background check? I shouldn't have taken this job before he had a start date. It's my fault we are living 5 hours from each other. How could I do this to him? Didn't I love him?

He comes up to see me for Halloween. He walks in the door but doesn't say hi. He glares at me. I didn't call him on his drive up to see me? He was bored! How could I have left him to be so bored? He was putting time and energy into coming up to see me, but I couldn't even bother to call him while he was driving? Was I an idiot? How could I do that to him? Didn't I love him?

He told me we were over. This time, I don't play my defined role. I say ""ok."" He is livid. I am supposed to fight back, but I don't have the energy. He throws things on the floor and goes to his parents. 

I start packing. I'm going to drive 2 hours to my parents. I can't be here anymore. While I'm packing he comes back. He's talked with his parents about our fight and he is going to give me another chance. I still don't apologize. I tell him I'm really breaking up with him and I'm going to my parents house. He cracks. He alternates between yelling at me, throwing things, and sobbing on my shoulder. 

I tell him I want to leave, but he won't let me. I try to leave but he physically holds me back. He tells me ""I'm not allowed to leave until I understand."" I tell him I do understand and this is my decision. He responds if this is my decision, I obviously don't understand well enough. 

After and hour, I am finally allowed to leave. I drive to my parents house, I'm so emotionally and physically exhausted. They don't ask questions and just give me a hug. God bless them. 

I spend the next month living with my parents commuting to work 2 hours each way. I'm afraid to go back to my apartment because he has a key. He texts and calls me 100s of times in this period. I don't answer. I'm depressed. I feel like a shell of a person. 

I slowly make steps back to being a human. I go back to living in my apartment. I make a friend at work. I try dating. My friends from college visit me and help me back to my feet. Three years go by and to the outside observer, I'm all better.

But to this day I'm still terrified that I'll see him again. I still have nightmares about him. I still live in his hometown. I avoid his favorite bars. I worry I will see him at the grocery store. Writing this all down made me shake and cry. 

I'm not sure how to end this, but Halloween always brings me back to those dark times. I feel so lucky to have been able to leave that situation, but sometimes I feel like my mind is still there. 

Maybe someone will read this and see a little of themselves in it. To you, I say that you are not stupid. You are not weak. You are being manipulated and abused.

"American Sharia: Why women should never leave the house, and how we are being convinced of this by our own counterparts.","I listened to a podcast about a girl being murdered walking to her car after a shift, and now I’m afraid to go to work. 


I was cat-called on the street, and now I don’t want to go on walks anymore.


After reading all of those “man or bear” discussions, I don’t even want to go hiking alone anymore. It used to be my favorite hobby, but seeing all of those threads about how awful men can be, I’d rather just stay home.


I’ve been lifting weights for a while now and have been sparring at my MMA gym, I’ve been really successful, but I’ve heard that “men pretending to be women” are trying to join combat sports, and men are over 1000% stronger than women, even the strongest woman could never beat the lowest 99% of men, so I think I should just stop because it is pointless. 


I’m not afraid of men, but everyone tells me I should be or I’m not a girls-girl. 


I’m a really accomplished systems analyst, but I keep hearing that any job I get will result in me getting underestimated and undermined. Should I just go into accounting? 


At what point do we take a moment to consider the potential that the feminist ideology has been high-jacked by bad actors? At what point do we define the line between earnestly considering the experiences people have had and recognizing that there are people who gain a lot from scaring us into shrinking back into the homes? At what point do we remember the virtue of unabashed feminine strength and tenacity that once pervaded the ideology and has been replaced with a narrative of ambiguous victimhood with threats of alienation?

I can’t stand how men try to say they are just as afraid of being attacked as women are,"Every time a woman says, “I wish I could walk alone and not fear for my life” a man has to chime in and say “men are scared to do that, too.” 

They don’t understand that it’s literally incomparable. They say it’s irrational and ridiculous that we feel our hearts racing and think of an exit plan when we’re walking somewhere alone at night and a lone man is walking close to us. They say they’re also scared of being attacked or raped just like us, as if they walk back to their cars with keys between their knuckles or look underneath their car to see if someone is going to slice their achilles and kidnap them. I am always on edge when I’m alone, and I just know men are not. 

It makes me so mad that they think this is the same, that men are just as scared of other men as women are. I wish they knew what it felt like.

Edit to add: I’m not saying men can’t be scared to walk alone at night or that they are not likely to be victims of crime. However, anything a man is a scared of, a woman is scared of and then some. Men might be scared of being robbed, women are scared of being robbed and raped, etc. And let’s not forget catcalling and wondering how we’re going to react to it to best avoid being attacked, which men almost never face.

I've been hit with world shaking news and I need advice,"I've not been well for weeks, felt really bad.

Anyway, I felt atrocious this morning, too. I had a pregnancy test and thought ok, I'll do it, it's my last one anyway. I took Plan B about 5 weeks ago, maybe 6. I tested up to 27 days later and got all negatives. This morning, it came back 1-2 weeks. We think with how I'm feeling it's likely to be more 3-4 weeks. Please, don't tell me congratulations. I have never, ever wanted to be in this position, and I'll be going ahead with medical abortion - I don’t even know how this has happened. I'm petrified, I'm nauseous, I'm so worried I'm gonna end up throwing up - I have SEVERE emetophobia, I work from home and I rarely go out - I'm all over. I've done everything to avoid this for years - I'm 26 now - and I've finally slipped up with the pill.

Can anyone who's had a medical abortion before please give me some insight. I'm petrified. I've called a line and left my name, dob and number and I'm waiting to hear from them. Me and my boyfriend are also going to go to a walk in health clinic today.

I heard back and they’re asking me to wait until Thursday to talk to them, and then another appointment after which will likely be the following week. I don’t feel like I can do this. Mentally I’m not coping whatsoever and I’m freaking out. 




Edit:

I know I can’t reply to everyone but I just wanted to thank you all so, so, so much. I’m petrified - both the pregnancy, and the possibility of sickness. But, I don’t feel as alone or ashamed anymore. It’s hard to express.. I’m not ashamed, but I am, too. I’m sad I have to do this, but more upset I let this happen. But you have all been so kind to me, and it has helped so dearly.

My sweet boyfriend is upset, he also doesn’t want children but still feels emotional. He’s been there for me, and will be for the next few weeks to hold my hand through it all.

I have called for an emergency anti-emetics prescription and should hear from my doctor in the next hour or two. I’ve been cramping for days, but it’s been more prevalent today, maybe cause I’m anxious and I’ve just found out. I have a call tomorrow for my mental health (my emetophobia funnily enough) so I will see if I can rush through the appointment with the clinic, but it’s unlikely. For now, that’s scheduled for Thursday. It’s also likely we will look at trying another form of contraceptive like the injection so there’s no chance of me missing it as this isn’t something I want to have to do ever again, and I haven’t even gotten to the hard part.",TwoXChromosomes,1240,1755517244.0,142,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mtjluu/ive_been_hit_with_world_shaking_news_and_i_need/
Neighbors tried to label me a prostitute because I was sexually active,"I lived in Melbourne, Australia for a bout a year (2013 to 2014). There, I met a gorgeous same sex couple - Brian and Derek ( name changed ). They were both bisexual. They lived in the same building as me on the floor directly above mine. I soon entered into a sexual relationship with both of them. We would have threesomes, and sometimes gangbangs. Besides the awesome sex, I also became really good friends with them and we're still in touch. It was tons of fun for all involved.

Among my neighbors, were a middle aged couple with two children. They lived right across the hallway from me and were quick to judge us after seeing Brian and Derek exiting my apartment early in the morning on more than one occasion. The woman, Karen asked me in the elevator what I was doing with ""those two gays"". I politely told her it was none of her business. When she kept on pestering me, I told her ""If you must know, I'm friends with benefits with them, now leave me alone"". I still remember the look of shock on her face. I don't think she expected me to reply so brazenly.

When I told Brian and Derek about this, they shared their own experience in dealing with them. This couple was rather homophobic too and had tried to talk to the property manager about ""the fags moving into a building with families and children"". They were told to fuck off (just not in so many words), but anytime either, or both of these guys were in the elevator with them, or ran into them in the parking lot, the husband (Let's call him Todd) would stand between them and his kids while giving Brian and/or Derek angry looks. Must've been trying to prevent their kids form catching ""the gay"". LOL

In the weeks that followed, the entitled couple continued to give me the stink eye any time they saw me. I just smiled back at them sweetly, which pissed them off even more. On one occasion, their teenage daughter said ""good morning"" to me and tried to make small talk, before her mother dragged her away by the arm, while berating her for talking to ""that woman"". Interestingly, their kids seemed very well behaved and nice and I truly felt sorry for them.

My next door neighbors (another couple with kids with whom I got along very well) later told me that EM had tried to get them to file a noise complaint against me. According to EM's logic, since I shared a wall with that family, they could probably hear all the ""ungodly"" noises coming from my apartment and they should complain in order to protect their children. The nice couple told them they would do no such thing as I had never bothered them and they had never heard any such noises coming out of my apartment.

One night, Brian Derek and I decided to have a foursome that would involve the three of us and Brian and Derek's friend Dean. The next morning, Dean asked if he could come back to my place with me. As it was a Sunday morning and Dean was hotter than hell, I agreed. As he and I were walking down the hallway to my place, Karen was just getting out of hers. She saw Dean and I smiling and talking and his arm around my waist and approached me, asking angrily if I was being "" a whore and selling my body"". I told her she was insane and asked her to kindly fuck off.

Later that day, I received a call from the property manager. She wanted to let me know that Karen and Todd had complained that I was "" a prostitute"" and that it was dangerous for their children to be in the same building as me. They told her in great detail about how I was bringing home different men. The property manager had gotten to know Brian and Derek quite well and had and inkling that I was friends with them. So she contacted them and they told her all about the EP's crazy behavior and accusations and that the man they had seen me with was a mutual friend, there was no prostitution going on. The property manager dissuaded EP from filing any sort of false complaint against me as it could cause a world of trouble for them. I thanked that kind lady and later had a good chuckle over it all with Brian and Derek.

The blatant harassment from Karen and Todd had stopped, but of course, the hateful looks continued. On one occasion, when we were in the elevator together, Karen tried made a pathetic attempt at shaming me by condescendingly asking if I was going to have any men over that night. What she didn't realize is that shame about my promiscuity is something I'm entirely incapable of feeling. I proceeded to tell her in great detail about all the sex acts I was going to engage in that evening. I mean, she's the one who asked, right?

After this fun little interaction, she and her husband avoided me completely. Good times.",TwoXChromosomes,7296,1583661964.0,406,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ffamxq/neighbors_tried_to_label_me_a_prostitute_because/

Background, I've been seeing him since April. He made it official this week, but we were very much in love before we put labels on it, or so I thought. I had never met another human that I thought so highly of. Genuinely the perfect guy. 

I walked into a bar with my friend last night and I immediately had this horrible feeling that he was there with another girl. I can't explain it. When I got to the bar I turned round and there he was, across from another girl. I thought they were friends, but then he leaned across the table and kissed her very passionately. I just stared at him, and when he pulled away we made eye contact. He whispered something to her then he got up and walked out. I followed him out and very calmly asked him if I could get my shoes from his flat which I had left there that morning, I woke up in his bed yesterday morning. He didn't seem to be feeling an ounce of guilt, but the way he was talking made me feel like he thought I'd get over it. He said he'd been hanging out with that girl for 20 minutes. He got angry at me but I kept myself completely level headed. He walked away, and I was going to leave it, but I could tell he was lying to me. 

I walked to his apartment, waited on the street outside, and a few minutes later he appeared with the girl. I wasn't trying to ambush him or anything, I just wanted to ask him for my shoes, because the thought of going back for them in a few days was too much, I just wanted my favourite shoes back and then I wanted him out of my life for ever.

He blew up on me. He was so mean. I've never heard anyone be as mean to anyone as he was to me. Then he was horrible to my friend. Then he hit me on the back, pushed me, picked me up and threw me against a big wooden post. After a while of him screaming at me, I decided to drop it. He wasn't going to give me the shoes. I accepted it and walked away. 

While I was walking I called the police non emergency number to report the assault. And as I was hanging up, he came screaming after me. He brought my shoes, threw them onto the road, and walked away. My friend was a couple of streets down waiting for the police. She was with them when I got there, and I gave a statement. Now would be a good time to say - I ate two pizzas last night, and had one glass of wine and two vodka and lemonades over a space of five hours. I was not drunk, I don't even think I'd class myself as being tipsy. He was very drunk, slurring his words. I gave my statement, my friend gave one that matched exactly, the law here meant that they had all the evidence they needed to arrest him, but I also played them a recording of some of the things he said to me to show how cruel he was being. 

I was told that if I wanted them to arrest him then he'd be held in a cell until Monday or Tuesday, then taken to court. Don't ask me why, but I couldn't bring myself to have him arrested. The police went to his place to caution him and let him know that he was very close to being in a cell for a few days. He tried to call me, and sent some angry texts, and then I blocked his number and all social media. 

My friend and I had some drinks, I stayed with her, I cried a LOT. Today I got a text from him on the one app I forgot to block him on, saying that the police told him he could file a harassment charge against me. The thing is, the police were very much on my side and very understanding and sympathetic. At no point did I block him from moving, touch him, step onto his property. I stood on the street. I never once raised my voice or said anything mean to him. I don't know why he wouldn't have threatened me with harassment charges last night. It's all just making me think he thought of it himself this morning and is using it to threaten me. Does he have grounds to have me arrested? I have no idea. I don't think he does. I didn't do anything wrong as far as I'm aware. He also said something about me wasting police time, but I asked the officers I spoke to if that's what I was doing, because I decided against arresting him. They assured me I wasn't. 

The girl, by the way, I was being very friendly to her. It's not her fault. I asked how long she's known him, she told me two weeks. She lives a fair distance from the city this took place in, she was staying at his place last night. She had nowhere else to go. I offered to pay the ridiculous price for the taxi, she declined. She was trying to make him just get my shoes but he wouldn't listen to any of us. 

So now I'm here. Completely paralysed by shock. I feel so sick. I can't eat anything, my stomach won't hold it. I have no more tears left to cry, I feel so empty. I'm so fucking traumatised. Every single man I see, I panic and think it's him. I keep seeing guys that look like him and having panic attacks every time. I'm not really sure how to move past this. It's like a feeling that I'll never be ok again. I know that I will be, but I think it'll take a long time. I don't know what to do about my fear of men. 

I've been verbally abused before. I've been cheated on before. I've been physically abused before. I've never had someone do all three at the same time, and the fact that it came from someone I adored that much is crushing me. I'm very very lucky to have an incredible support system, my friends are truly the best. 

Now I need to get STD checks and a pregnancy test. I'm dreading that. 

And part of me wants to much to tell the police to arrest him, but another part of me doesn't want to ruin his life. That sounds crazy. 

I absolutely, 100%, would NEVER consider getting back with him, even if all he did was cheat, I would never, but the fact he was being so hateful towards me while trying to keep her... why her? Why not me? Why is he fighting for her and not me? I've been trying so hard to be perfect for him, be exactly what he wants, and I don't know why I'm not good enough. 

I don't really know what the purpose of this post is. I just needed to vent, and maybe hear from some other woman who may have experienced something similar. Sorry for the length.

Getting really tired of creepy men,"A couple days ago, I was in line to check out at the grocery store. It was 9am. The man behind me - looked to be in his mid30s - pet my hair. Like I was a dog or something. Just reached out and stroked my head. WTF. When I protested, he said my hair was “just so pretty”. I told the supervisor and he just made the guy go to a different checkout line and didn’t say anything.

Yesterday, I was at PetsMart. I’d just come out of the store with my cat food. It was dark outside and I was fumbling with my fob to unlock my door. A man came up behind me - SILENTLY- and put his face next to my ear and whispered loudly (idk how to describe it) asking if I needed help. I about had a heart attack. When I declined, he just stood there and watched me until I drove away. 

A few days ago, I attempted to buy something from OfferUp. I was going to meet the seller in a public spot (preferably the police station parking lot) and was trying to set something up when the seller started making sexual innuendos. I couldn’t decide if I was maybe reading too much into it or not so I kept trying…until he asked if I’d be willing to trade my used underwear for the item. BLOCK. WTF is wrong with them?

And the last but the worst - I volunteer at a children’s hospital twice a week on the oncology floor. Last week, I was there, hanging out with this one kid who is kinda my favorite. She and I have very similar interests and personalities, she’s basically a mini me and I love her so much. We were playing video games when the pastor/chaplain came in to her room - without knocking, which is also annoying. Instead of talking to the patient he started trying to chat me up. When I acted uninterested - only giving one word answers, not looking at him, etc - he then asks me for my phone number “to keep me updated on the activities at the hospital”. I declined, giving the excuse that I never give out my personal number. He doubles down and asks if I have a Snapchat or WhatsApp account. I just stared at him until he got uncomfortable. After he left, the first word the patient said was “Ew”. My thoughts exactly. Gross. And he was wearing a wedding ring. ETA: I reported the pastor to the hospital. 

Oh! And one more I forgot. I was out running errands. I was driving down a particular street, anyone who lives in my city knows that the right lane merges into the left at a certain point. Dude was in the right lane and needed to merge. I slowed down to let him in and he started yelling at me from behind his window and his face was turning red. He wouldn’t merge and we were holding up traffic so I just gave up and sped up, leaving him to merge in behind me. He followed me to the pharmacy and when I noticed, I immediately locked my doors and didn’t get out of the car. He walked up to my car, began screaming and yelling, and started pounding on my hood like a deranged gorilla on meth. He did this for FIVE minutes! I recorded the whole thing, including his car and license plate. It was terrifying. He finally stopped when a dude in the parking lot took notice and started yelling at him to stop. 

What is wrong with these men? Do they not have social skills anymore? Why do they think this kind of behavior is acceptable? I’d never purposefully touch a stranger, unless it was an emergency or something. I just don’t understand. Anyone else dealing with this bs?

"I just need to talk about my abortion, and I hope it helps someone.","I, my husband, and our two year old live in Japan. My husband is active duty and got stationed here about three years ago.

A couple weeks ago I was about 21 weeks along with our second child, and we went  in to have the anatomy scan. It was discovered then that our little girl had anencephaly, which means her brain never formed beyond the brainstem. It's a very rare condition and 100% fatal. The cruel trick that comes with it is that everything else is usually completely fine. The pregnancy was going very easily, she had a perfectly healthy heartbeat, and I occasionally got some strong kicks. But this is something that happens at about four weeks, which means that pretty much when we found out I was pregnant, we already lost her. She never had, and never could have had, any sense of feeling, smell, taste, sight, or hearing, or even the ability to swallow. I was little more than life support for her and within minutes or possibly hours from birth, she would die, without any sense of me or anything around her.

We were quickly taken up to the OB floor of the hospital to talk to a couple doctors about our options. I could stay pregnant and just let things run its course, possibly giving birth to a live baby or possibly not, or I could terminate the pregnancy. The choice was obvious to both of us right away that we wanted to terminate. Being in the military and overseas, my husband and his dependents (daughter and I) had only the option of Tricare for health insurance. Normally a wonderful thing because it's affordable and covers everything. But all they cover as far as abortions is in the case of rape, incest, or if the mother's life is in danger. After looking further into it I also saw that they won't cover any mental health needs after an abortion that they didn't cover. The very minimum amount of compassion. The doctors seemed used to and sympathetic to our situation and had information and resources ready for us. They were willing to help me have it done in a Japanese hospital, but out of pocket it would be about $8,000, and I was only two days away from their limit of 21 weeks. The other option was Planned Parenthood in California. They were very accommodating getting addresses, phone, and fax numbers.

It was Wednesday when this happened, and early the next morning (because of the time difference) my husband made me an appointment for the following Tuesday at Planned Parenthood. As you can imagine, last minute flights from Japan to the US are very expensive, so I went by myself. Luckily all my family is in California so I wasn't actually alone, but many times I imagined other women in my same position having to do all this on their own, as I'm sure many did.

I landed late Sunday and my appointment was early Tuesday. I thought there would be a lot of forms to fill out but there was just one paper, for a program called Presumptive Medical, which will temporarily insure children and pregnant women. Luckily(?) the military doesn't pay well so we were well under the limit for a family of three and the entire procedure was covered. My emotions were already at the tipping point and this news practically brought a tear to my eye. We already had blown through our savings buying my ticket, and paying for this procedure would be another two or three thousand dollars. 

Abortion in the second trimester is a two day process, and the first day is dilating the cervix. When I got in the room they asked a few questions about medical and family history, then I had blood drawn, then they gave me I think 400mg Ibuprofen and one antibiotic. The doctor was extremely kind and personable and showed me a picture of a uterus, how the procedure worked, and the risks. She asked if I understood, if I felt pressured, and if this is what I wanted.

It started out like a pap smear - I stripped from the waist down, had a blanket to cover me, and put my legs up in stirrups. She warned me that the speculum was smaller but I'd feel a lot more pressure. That part was actually pretty painful. Earlier after reading about the procedure I was kind of worried about the shot they'd give me to numb my cervix, but I barely felt it and might not have even noticed if I hadn't known it was coming. It also temporarily causes a weird feeling in your ears like you're under water. Then I started shaking uncontrollably, which seems like it would just be nerves although I felt really calm, so that made me think it was the numbing shot. Either way, it was impossible to control my legs especially with the position they were in. Other than that I wasn't having any issues. These little things that look like really small tampons had to be put in my cervix and she said sometimes they can only get about half of them in because for some women it gets to be too painful, so then they have to come back four hours later for the rest. I really didn't want to have to do that and luckily I didn't have to because up until the last four or five I didn't feel a thing. By the last few I started feeling some strong cramps and pressure. Getting all of them in is important though because it makes the next day easier and safer. When she was done she put in a little bit of cotton as well as some gauze coated in some liquid that was either anti-inflamatory or antibiotic, I can't remember, but it looked gross and bloody. 

After that it took me a few minutes to stop shaking, and I was feeling a lot of pressure and pretty dizzy. After a while I slowly stood up but then went right back to lying down again. The doctor went and got me Sprite and a granola bar, then she even went out of her way to have me lie back and put my legs up on her knee to help with my lightheadedness. I started slowly walking down the hallway but felt lightheaded again so they took me the rest of the way in a wheelchair. 

While making the appointment they said it would be better if I had a hotel room for that night so I could be close by. If I had any emergencies during the night I could easily get back and they could take care of me. It wasn't too long before I took the Ibuprofen and codeine they prescribed because I was getting some pretty bad cramps. It felt just like a really bad period. There was also a lot of pressure so it was hard to walk around, but they recommended not to walk anyway. I kept a heating pad on all night and that helped a lot. Luckily the medicine kicked in after a couple hours so then I got my appetite back, which I was hoping for because they said no eating or drinking after midnight. Despite everything, I slept quite a lot between about 2 or 3 pm and 6am the next morning, probably thanks to the medicine.

My second appointment was at 8am the next morning and they had given me two dissolvable tablets the day before and said to put them in my cheeks right away when I got there. These were going to help efface my cervix, basically starting labor. They tasted like chalk and took a really long time to dissolve, but after they did they made me feel cold and made me shake a lot, which is a common side effect. There were two other women in the waiting room with blankets, shivering like me. I was waiting a long time, three hours I think. During that time I broke down crying once or twice, and there was at least one other woman doing the same. I knew that Planned Parenthood has some long wait times, but part of it might also have been just the fact that they needed that medicine to kick in. It was in the last hour maybe that I started to feel some really light contractions.

Once they took me back I had to first strip down everything and put a hospital gown on. They had a container there for me with a blanket and hospital booties and for putting my clothes in. The nurse came in and saw my gown was on backwards and helped me fix it, she tried to maintain my privacy with a blanket but I really didn't care. I also had an IV put in and was given a small amount of clear liquid that looked just like water but tasted pretty much like straight lemon juice, and she said that was to neutralize my stomach acid, helping to make general anesthesia safer. Then she helped me get to the bathroom one last time since I wouldn't be getting a catheter (you only get knocked out about 20 minutes). I asked if the same doctor that did my procedure the day before would be doing the one today, since I liked her. She said no, and said ""But she's kind and very experienced and passionate and one of the most inspirational people I know"". 

After getting a few seconds alone in the bathroom I broke down crying again, and kept crying as I was lead down the hall to the final procedure. There were three people in there with scrubs and a much softer looking bed with supports for my knees to be up. I had no fears or regrets but I knew this was the end to the time with my baby that never had a chance.

They gently instructed me to open the back of my gown and lie back on the bed, and they helped my put my knees up. One of the nurses was wiping my tears and said, ""It's okay honey you'll go to sleep and not feel a thing"" and I said I wasn't worried about that. Then the doctor walked up and introduced herself and asked if I wanted to talk about what I was feeling. I said, ""It's a baby that we wanted but she has anencephaly."" My memory is fuzzy after that point but I think she expressed sympathy and asked whether I had other children and mentioned we could also try again in a couple months. I answered and the nurse dabbed my tears, then I mentioned my arm was burning. When I woke up I was in the recovery room feeling groggy. Once I woke a little more the tears started flowing again. The doctor was there and I asked if she had anencephaly, and she replied yes, and I asked if she passed away inside of me and she replied yes. I asked what would happen to her now and she said she'd be cremated. Then she asked if I wanted footprints and I said yes. A couple minutes later she came back with a really nice square envelope, with ""Baby (last name)"" written on it.

Once my tears were done I felt pretty much fine and with little discomfort. It did burn when I peed though, and upon further inspection the next day I think I did tear just the teeniest bit, which was probably due to the use of forceps. As sad as the whole situation was, I did feel a sense of relief to have it be over with. Physically I was feeling pretty good, with very little bleeding or cramping. Just like it said online, I felt almost back to normal after a day. Like one of my friends said, it's not the physical recovery that's tough after an abortion, it's the emotional recovery. But for my situation I was still recovering from the news we got on the day of the anatomy scan, from a week before. Starting from that point I already missed my baby, who we had planned on, and extended our time in Japan for, and named. But afterwards I missed my pregnancy, and my belly, and mourned the fact that despite my body doing everything right, the baby never had a chance. I was reminded of that again three days later when my milk came in too, although luckily not strongly.

I needed to get this out because I haven't been able to find stories like mine and hardly anything about second trimester abortions other than just some medical aspects. I hope my story helps someone, and to anyone who reads this please feel free to message me if you have questions or are going through the same thing.

Tl;Dr - 20+5 anatomy scan showed anencephaly for our little girl, a fatal condition. We are a military family overseas and Tricare has very little coverage for abortions. So I went to Planned Parenthood in California, where I was met with a lot of kindness, patience, and compassion. I came here to share my experience with abortion. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and sharing your experiences.

My husband was looking into starting some kind of charity to help people in a similar situation as us who find themselves with last minute travel expenses and possibly large medical bills. And I was thinking of how to directly bring about change and awareness. The only way seems to be contacting members of Congress, sharing my story, and calling for a change to the Hyde Amendment (the reason Tricare didn't cover me).

My abuser died on Monday and now I'm feeling all the things.,"Possible trigger: suicide and abuse

On Monday night I got a phone call that my ex had died. His Mom called to tell me he was dead, my first thought was OD, that was the most likely scenario, and then for a second I thought Covid, then she said he had hanged himself in the closet while she was gone. He had just got out of treatment, again, and had 21 days clean. He would have been 50 in July.

I escaped from him about 9 years ago. We have a child together, my kid knows nothing about him, not even his name. He's like Voldemort, no one names him. I still talk to his mom on a regular basis, I send school pictures every year and random snaps via text.

My first response was to be heartbroken, the guy that I knew, when he was sober, was amazing, he was charismatic, he could always make me laugh, he was my best friend, but he was also a fucking monster. The thought of him standing in that closet, alone, making that choice to end it is so fucking tragic to me, my heart hurts for the person I loved.

Now it's been a few days and I woke up feeling relief. I'm relieved my child will always be safe from him. I'm relived the insane phone calls and harassment will finally stop. I'm relieved that I can finally stop looking over my shoulder, he used to tell me all he ways he could kill me and get away with it.

He did me an amazing solid by removing himself from the equation. He wasn't a good person, he used and abused SO many people. He really had no remorse for the things he had done.

I went on his Mom's FB page today and there are so many posts about how much he was loved and basically what a Saint he was. People are releasing balloons in his honor, we met I was living in Maui and he lived there on and off for years so there are people doing a lei ceremony on surf boards. They obviously never knew the monster I lived with. No one ever believed it was all that bad, he was tricky like that. They didn't believe that he had really burned me with cigarettes, or stomped on my hand and broke my fingers, made me sleep outside for missing the bus home, none of it. 

Fortunately, he's not on the birth certificate, and my child has my last name. The day of the birth he showed up wasted on whisky and pulled me out of the bed and choked me out for not wanting to eat the sandwich he brought, he wasn't caught in the act, but the nurse knew something was up so she made him leave. He never carried his ID when he was wasted so he couldn't sign off. Small favors I guess.

When my child was 3 months old I got out of the shower and he was smoking heroin about 5 feet away from the baby in the bouncy chair thing, when I confronted him he hurt me in front of the baby. As I stood there crying I looked at the baby and realized I had a choice, the baby did not. I bided my time and hid money away and during his next bender I packed up whatever I could fit in my car and drove 1000 miles home to my family. That is the last time I ever saw him.

Still all these years people would think I was being ridiculous and over dramatic and would give him my number, so he'd call all the time and leave crazy messages. I just realized that's my life now so I dealt with it. His mom never did give him my info, she knew how awful he was when he was messed up, however he's still her baby boy, so it's all sorts of weird dynamics there.

It's been almost 10 years and I'm still dealing with the fallout of the abuse I lived through, he forever changed me as a person. I really do feel like a weight has been lifted. One I didn’t even realize I was carrying anymore. I'm fucking relived he's gone.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I just needed to somewhat anonymously get this all out. I'm not working right now, but my job offers free therapy options so I have a call into my HR department.

EDIT: 
I basically posted this as a shower thought that I needed to get out of my brain. I woke up and was overwhelmed by all the awards, comments, and upvotes. I have read all the comments, even the mean and shitty ones. It's been really helpful actually, all the kind words and reading that I am not alone in all of this.

To give a little more info since I've been asked, this is a little more backstory that also answers some of the repeated questions.

I suffer from severe Crohn's disease and a couple of other immune disorders so I was dependent on him for help with a lot of things. He def used that to this advantage. I honestly had no idea how bad he (and our relationship) really was until I was was completely out of the situation. I never thought I would be one of those people that lived in a DV situation. It made me realize it could really happen to anyone. It was like the old frog in the pot story. 

I never thought I was brave or strong for escaping like I did, it was just what I felt I needed/had to do for both of our safety and well being. I worked the entire time I was pregnant, he wouldn't work and his mom wouldn't send him anymore money, so I just did what I thought had to be done. (He was basically a grown PeterPan with a trust fund, his family has A LOT of money, like fly to Mexico just for dinner kind of money.) I don't want any money from them, it would be nice, but I feel like there would be way too many strings attached.

I literally worked until the day my child was born. I was a server, I worked the mid shift, I got off work at 4 and I checked into the hospital at 9. I had to go back to work at the 6 week mark, I didn't feel like I had any other choice. I had developed kidney stones during my pregnancy, they were so large that I had to have surgery to remove them, but they couldn't do the surgery since I was almost 8 months pregnant. They put a stint in and I went back to work. They induced me a month early because I was in so much pain all the time.

After I went back to work, I was trying to make it all work, but it was just too much. I was hospitalized a handful of times between the birth and the time I finally left. By the time I got home I only weighed 85 lbs. I looked like a walking skeleton.

Due to the Crohn's disease and other issues I was getting a lot of pain medication, it was a lot easier to obtain in those days, so I started self medicating with opioids and xanax. It got really bad. Fortunately, I have a very supportive family who was there for me through all of this. I no longer abuse medication, I am awake and present for my life, for both the good and bad.

I was able to pull it together for myself and my kid, it was really hard and a lot of struggling  to get where I am today. I got myself into counseling, went back to school and finished a degree and started another one. I was single until my child was about 4, I met someone who is now my fiancé, I have a job that I love, we just bought a home together in February. If you told me 10 years ago I'd be doing what I'm doing now I would not have believed you.

My son is happy and well adjusted, I've told him age appropriate things throughout the years when he's asked. For all intents and purposes he has a Dad, who he calls Dad, and a lot of other great male influences in his life, my Dad, my Step-dad, and a couple of really great Uncles. I've never lied to him when he's asked about his Dad, and I will tell him about things in time. I don't feel like he needs to know right now. He's almost 10 for those who asked his age.

Again, thank you for all of your words and stories, it's been unbelievably helpful throughout the day. I'm still working through a lot in my brain.",TwoXChromosomes,11866,1587677388.0,274,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/g6vdi5/my_abuser_died_on_monday_and_now_im_feeling_all/
"They didn’t believe us because he was a nice looking,nerdy, professional white guy","Trigger warning- stalking,violence,lewd sexual behavior  and rape ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ 


February 2019 a new neighbor moved into my quiet and mainly peaceful building. James is a nice looking, nerdy, professional white guy in his early thirties. He was polite (in the beginning),has a good job and looked like a good guy. But he started to target me (27f) and Claire (30f) my neighbor. It started small with him being overly familiar and excessively friendly,to invasive small talk while waiting for the elevator,asking if I had a boyfriend, if Id share a drink with him, or if the guy that visited me was my boyfriend(then later started saying it was my baby-daddy/sugar-daddy, it was my dad and I have zero kids. He was just being racist). 

At first I kept it polite but short. Then he asked me out. I let him down gently. Told him I wasn’t dating right now. Then he started saying we should be friends and invited me to parties at his. I gave him all the excuses, oh I’m working/got plans/got a headache/tired etc. Then one day he cussed me out for being a tease(I swear to all that is good I never once was interested in this man and never was anything but neighborly to him). 

Then I found out he was doing the same(not exactly the same cause I got a nice side dish of racism with my abuse) to our neighbor Claire who lives right next to me, who was also keeping it polite with him. After awhile he must’ve realized neither of us could be persuaded to go out with him. 

He then became angry. He started slamming the doors behind him if he saw either of us approaching. He would mutter stuck up bitch or n-slur in my case. My doormat was always mysteriously wet/white-ish stuff on my door handle. Random dms calling me the n-slur/talking about the good old days/degrading racist porn being sent from blank accounts. To packages going missing. Then one day he just touched his genitals in front of me. He just put his hand down his pants and started to rub himself. Then he started to watch porn on his phone really loudly when he was near me or stood really close to me in the elevator.

After months of this disgusting behavior. Claire and I started to complain heavily to building management of every instance of lewd behavior since the super/resident manager wasn’t of much help with our initial complaints. And these motherfuckers decided to tell him that we were the ones that had made the complaints in their meeting with him. Well that upset him alright! James’s erratic behavor became more targeted, more frequent and much scarier. It was near constant harassment and lewd behavior. He accosted me and Claire at every chance he got. He was escalating and it all started with just looking at us dirty,getting too close,muttering swear words and then it turned to sexual harassment (making sex noises, aggressively touching himself every time he saw either of us, whipping his dick out,rubbing against us), getting in our faces, breathing down our neck in the elevator just an increase of belligerent behavor.

Then a few weeks ago he threatened to sexually assault me “and see if that wouldn’t loosen the stick stuck up my ass”. I knew in my soul and without a doubt that this man was going to try to hurt me. I left and went to stay with my parents. I called Claire and told her to leave as this man is out of control. She refused to leave as this was her home. Last Saturday I returned home because I was tired of staying at my parents and had hoped he had cooled down. I spoke to Claire and she told me he hadn’t bothered her in awhile. At around 6pm I decided to get some food. I returned,parked my car and started walking towards the elevators,he then chased me in our underground parking lot(I didn’t see him chase me but I heard heavy foot steps running towards me so I just ran, instinctively) As soon as the elevator doors closed I called the police and they came out a few minutes later. This was maybe the 5th time I called the police on him in the last 2 months.

They told me they couldn’t do anything since I never saw his face and that gut instinct wouldn’t be enough to accuse someone of a crime. Okay fair. They even seemed frustrated with me as if I was bothering them. I begged them to at least check with the super for any security footage. Conveniently the camera was awaiting repair’s (its been awaiting repairs for almost a year now). The police left at around 7:30/7:40pm after advising building management to deal with him since this wasn’t the first time I or Claire had reported this man for harassment and intimidation. At around midnight Claire returned from work. James was awake, he somehow snuck behind her and pushed her in as she was opening her door. He beat her and raped her. He then fell asleep. She somehow found the courage and strength to get up and sneaked herself out. She banged my door several times as it was around 5:20am and I was asleep, I was scared at first and thought it was him but when I looked through the peephole. I noticed it was a completely naked Claire and I let her in. She was really hurt. It was brutally painful just looking at her. We called the police and when they arrived he was still asleep. They arrested him. Claire was taken to the hospital and I went with her. While I was in the waiting room I had the worst panic attack of my life and had to be sedated. (I was raped when I was 22 and suffer from ptsd ever since, so it was a traumatizing night and I hadn’t slept much the night before as I was completely wired up and anxious from him chasing me earlier )  

All of this could’ve been avoided if the police, building management/property company took us seriously.

INFO- using fake names and obviously Claire and I have already moved out. Claire is staying at her grandparents and I am now living at my parents.

Also I have a security camera that has recorded most of his behavior. I have written evidence of me contacting the building manager and escalating things to the management company. Emails sent to the property company that owns the building. I have recordings of James verbally abusing me,groping me,threatening me and I have recordings of my conversations with the police and building manager of every incident and they were aware I was recording them. I have video evidence of him pissing on my front door. A recording of hem smearing sperm on my door/door handle and on Claire’s door. Claire has the same recording as she also has a front door camera. From the moment we knew he was out of control we started documenting everything.",TwoXChromosomes,6393,1639072305.0,261,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/rcn11e/they_didnt_believe_us_because_he_was_a_nice/
"People are just so mean to ugly women. Please be kinder, Reddit","Warning: wall of text ahead

I am an ugly woman. Objectively, I really am. Please don't argue with me on this one, Reddit. I am not overweight, actually in better shape than most women my age, I dress well, I am great with makeup.

But last weekend the world just had to remind me that despite all this, people will go out of their way to kick me.

I don't often go clubbing, but Saturday night was a special occasion. A friend was celebrating her 21st, and it was also the weekend after a long week of brutal exams. It felt like a good time to blow off some steam. Because I don't often go clubbing, I really tried this night to look nice. There was an outfit that I had bought a long time ago, but that I'd never worn because it was a little sexier than what I usually wear. A close friend had picked it out for me when we were shopping, and, in that ""you go girl"" kind of way had urged me to buy it. I did my makeup painstakingly, straightened my hair which always takes forever because my hair is huge, put on that too-sexy-for-me outfit. 

And when I looked in the mirror I was even surprised at myself. ""Wow, is that me? I actually look...nice!""

I showed my friends. They all said I looked great. And they MEANT it too. Like, genuine happy encouragement. I could tell they were sincere and it made me feel so good, like for once I wasn't just masquerading as an attractive girl with fancy makeup and clothes, but that I WAS the attractive girl. I hadn't felt so attractive in ages, Reddit.

When we got to the club, we got a nasty surprise. We had been told that tonight there was no cover charge for girls, and so none of us had brought much cash on our person. Well, our info was wrong. They did indeed ask for a cover. Only one of us 6 girls had cash, and she only had enough to cover two people. When we got to the door and found this out, a group of guys behind us volunteered to help us out. They each forked over a couple of bucks to cover my friends, but not one of them offered to cover me. One by one my friends were let in and they waited on the other side of the door until everyone got through. There was an ATM machine nearby and at this point I was wishing I could just slip away and get the cash from there, but I was holding up the line, my friends weren't about to enter without me, and it was rather chilly and no one waiting in line was getting any happier. The guys were doing everything to avoid eye contact with me. They were looking at the ground, the street, pretending to look through their wallets for cash to cover one more girl. It was so painfully obvious that I felt like just going home. Luckily, my friend with the extra cash covered me so I was allowed in.

Well, once we were inside I thought I could just forget about that incident. I had dressed up and come out, to have a good time and relax.  So for a while I danced with my friends. It wasn't long before other guys started dancing with us. We kind of paired off slowly, there was a guy whose two buddies had started dancing with other girls and he was left alone. At that point I too had lost track of my friends and was alone. He started dancing with me, but the whole time he seemed really distracted. Not once did he really look at my face, he was kinda looking around the club the whole time, like he was browsing the scene for another, more attractive girl he could bounce to. In less than 10 minutes, he had seen one. He peaced out without a word, and I saw him dancing a few minutes later with a very attractive brunette. The way he acted with her was just SO different than when he had danced with me. He was face to face with her, smiling, dancing enthusiastically.

That made my stomach drop. I went to the bar, found one of my friends who was sitting there with a guy. She introduced us, he bought everyone drinks. After a while I felt like a bit of a third wheel so I went back to the dance floor.

Eventually my group of girls regathered together. Everyone had a guy, except for one of them who had a bf at home. So I danced with her, with our friends and their guys near us. 

There was a photographer going around the club, taking pictures of the people there. I assume it was for some promo for their website or something. He got to our group, and literally circled us several times, taking several pics from different angles. I was kind of psyched about this, so I did my best to look like I was having a good time, made sure he could snap me at my best. But after a while I realized he wasn't circling us to get our best angles. He was trying to get a frame without ME. If I moved closer to the center of the group, for instance, he would tilt his camera a little the other way. I couldn't believe it until finally, he actually came up to me and asked me to get out of the shot.

I felt so ugly right then. For all the effort I had put into looking and feeling good that night, it seemed like it just didn't matter. So the night ends with me leaving the club. My friend with the bf at home who was dancing with me left with me so I wouldn't be alone. The rest of my girl friends didn't notice what had happened with the photographer, so when they asked me where I was going I just told them I was tired and wanted to go home. And since I wasn't leaving alone, they let me.

So yeah, that's my story from the weekend.

Please be kinder to ugly people, Reddit. Maybe one of the people I met that night will read this post and recognize themselves. I hope so, if only so they can know how behavior they're barely conscious of can affect someone else.

EDIT: I have always been a lurker on Reddit so I'm not sure if I can find out who gave me gold. But thank you, stranger! I will enjoy this gold while it lasts. :)

EDIT2: A number of people have asked for a picture of me to judge for themselves if I really am as unattractive as this post suggests. I know you all mean well but my looks are a bit of a sore point right now so I will not be sharing any photos on Reddit. I was able to post this story because of my relative anonymity here on a massive internet forum under a throwaway account. I do not want to give up this anonymity.

A waitress was concerned for my safety,"This happened a few months back but I really felt like I should share it. I was driving to a friend's house who lives 40 minutes away from me and on the way my friend asked me to pick up to go food from Sonny's BBQ. Around 8:30 at night, I pulled over at the exit on the highway, and went inside and order togo food. I sat there quietly for a few moments and then a very drunk man came into the restraunt. He was a very loud, had extremely bad language, and took notice that I was sitting by myself.  He began talking at me and asked where my boyfriend was, why was I sitting alone, and implied that he wasn't seeing anyone either. I was very nervous: I was basically in the middle of no where, at night, and my friend was still a good 10 miles away. He kept trying to sit closer and closer, getting more and more frustrated that I wasn't answering.  20 minutes of this harassment continued until the waitress arrived with the togo food. She did not just have my food, but the man's as well. Just as we both picked up our food, the waitress says, "" You know what, I forgot something for your order,  just wait a second."" I sat back down and the man also waited. 5 minutes went by and the man finally says his goodbyes and leaves. As soon as he walked out, the waitress comes to me and says, "" I really didn't forget anything in your order, I just didn't want you to walk out at the same time with that creep. I think he is still in the parking lot, so let me walk you to your car."" Out we both went, into the parking lot. I got in my car, thanked her profusely, locked the doors and watched her walk into the restraunt. The next day I called her manager and the regional manager and told them what had happend and how greatful I was to her. I was so impressed on how above and beyond this waitress went for my saftey. She recongized an uncomfortable situation and took action to make sure I was safe. I guess it's just nice to know that good Samaritans are looking out for you, even at a Sonny's BBQ.",TwoXChromosomes,8101,1469068176.0,560,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4tuske/a_waitress_was_concerned_for_my_safety/
A rant about existing outside at night,"I’m in a new city for a few weeks, and have been exploring with my traveling companions. One is a male, and one is a female. 

For the most part I have been walking around with the female (I’m also female) and we have been getting (creepy) unsolicited comments from several groups of men at all times of day. These range from ‘You’re looking sweet, do you need a boyfriend,’ to ‘Have you ever had an Englishman, I’ll take care of you,’ and ranged all over the place in between. 

Yesterday I called my boyfriend and was venting to him that I felt like I couldn’t enjoy things about the city that I wanted to because I felt so uncomfortable and didn’t want to go out by myself after dark. He felt/ feels that I’m overreacting and just projecting because I haven’t been to this city before. He said that he gets approached when abroad often, too, and that these men are probably just being friendly. 

Last night I went out with the male in my group and we walked through all of the same parts of the neighborhood that I had been through with my female companion, and the tone was completely different. This was after midnight, and if we were acknowledged at all by a group they were friendly and asking how our night was going, joking with him about if I’m keeping him ‘in line’ or not, and etc. 

I’m so frustrated because I literally would not be able to explain to my male friend (or my boyfriend for that matter) about how much different their daily experience is than mine.

Leaving the house after 10PM alone isn’t even an option for me until I go home, and he can leave, drink, be careless, and not even have to deal with being uncomfortable, let alone being unsafe. 

Edit: To all of the men asking how they can help women feel more comfortable: you are probably not the problem, for me at least. 

If you happen to be yelling at women while they are walking in the streets, please stop doing that. It’s not flattering. If you start to follow someone after yelling at them to continue yelling FOR
THE LOVE OF GOD STOP. 

I appreciate all of the men who have asked and are trying to understand what women feel like and how to make it better. ",TwoXChromosomes,3769,1524924598.0,847,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8fk3rf/a_rant_about_existing_outside_at_night/
I found this on tumblr and i just think all women need to see this(about public harassment),"http://imgur.com/4TUpHBN

more than that : if you see a girl being harassed, she won’t always have that reflex. So YOU go and tell her : “Hiiii (insert random name here) I didn’t see you ! what are you doing here ? So glad to see you, come sit with me”. I promise you the girl won’t think twice before going with you.

I was with friends in a late night tramway once, everyone was drunk and tired, and there was a girl all alone in the seat facing ours. She minded her own business, finishing the sauce of an empty french fries carton. Two drunk guys show up and sit on each side of her, telling her that she shouldn’t eat that, that she will get fat, that it would be a shame to let such a pretty body go fat, and a various number of disgusting things. So I said “hey Julie, why are you letting those douchebags annoy you, come back, sit with us.” She looked at me and immediately changed sides to sit with us. The guys were surprised, saying “she’s your friend ?!” and I just replied “yes, and you’re annoying her right now.” I stayed with her until she got out of the tramway safe.

When you’re being harassed it’s sometimes very hard to think straight and find a quick way to react, so I encourage everybody to do this if you see another woman being harassed. Pretend you know her, and that she’s your friend. Let her know you’re here to side with her and protect her.

The guy Ive been seeing just revealed his true colours and I don't know how to react,"Hey everyone, Im actually struggling to have the words to describe how Im feeling rn, but I need advice, please.

Basically, I (21F) have been seeing this guy for a few weeks and everything was going great. He was the kindest, sweetest person, always asking me if Im okay, always being sure I was enjoying being with him. And that is the reason why I was so into the guy, I thought he truly was the best.

Yesterday, he asked me (all of a sudden) if I was only with him or sleeping around and I told him that I don't sleep around, I need a connection with a person, but that he could do wtv he was comfortable with. Im aware that he is in a moment of finding himself and so, even though I obviously don't want him to be with other girls, Im aware we have a very recent thing. He didnt like my answer though and texted me saying that the fact I wasn't sleeping with other guys made him uncomfortable and pressured him and he basically ended wtv we had going on. This happened at 5 pm.

Today, I woke up with 450 messages/call in all my social media from that guy, because he decided to get drunk and come to my street (thankfully he doesn't know my house number, as he has never been here) and harass me until I met him. The problem is that was fucking 4 am and so I was asleep with my phone on silence mode. The messages were very creepy and said things like ""how do you know you love me?"" and ""i need you in my life forever"", which scared the shit out of me because 1. i never said i loved him and 2. that is creepy guy material.

When I woke up, I asked him ""wtf"" and told him that I don't need a walking red flag in my life. He apologized and said he was very drunk and that he needed to think about his life before talking to me. Im so sad, because yesterday morning we were in a perfect place, i was so happy and thought I was so lucky. And now, even though I like him a lot, Im scared and feel very uncomfortable. I just wish I could erase the last 24h of my life.

**EDIT**:

 I just arrived home after taking the day for myself and Im overwhelmed with the amount of support you guys are giving me, thank you so much! I cant answer all the comments, but he is 21 years old (as I am). Also, he just sent me a funny tik tok like nothing had happened and Im even more confused. 

I have in restricted on Instagram (meaning, he cant see that I saw his messages), so I will just wait to see if he says something so I can just tell him I'm not interested in being with him again. The problem is that, because Im living abroad and we share some friends in this country, we will probably bump into each other in the next couple of months (that is why I didn't just block him). 

Anyways, Im not interested or comfortable with being with him again that way and even though I will miss having someone and I really liked being with him, its not like we were that serious, so I will just move on and hope to find a good person in the future.

**Edit 2**: 

I texted him saying it was fun while it lasted and he agreeed ending things was for the best and was very nice about it. Like some people said here, he is not a psychopat, he is just young and stupid and need to work on his own problems (and he told me several times about them during our short relationship).

He rarely drinks (this was the first time I saw him drinking and we went to clubs together twice) and this was just a very stupid move from him. With this said, Im not going back to him and will remember the good memories but always knowing the bad things.",TwoXChromosomes,3529,1638177377.0,357,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/r4rypw/the_guy_ive_been_seeing_just_revealed_his_true/
When reaching out to the “other woman” goes right,"Saw a post on here earlier about not being afraid to reach out to the “other woman” and thought this story might fit here. 

When I was in my early 20s, I met a guy named David through my roommate. They were coworkers. She was going out for drinks one night with some people she worked with and invited me along. He was cute in that Jeremy Allen White sort of way and we hit it off. He got my number and we went out on our first date the following week. Because of his work schedule, he only had Wednesday nights off consistently so that’s usually when we would meet up. After a few weeks, we have the exclusivity talk and alls going well. 

One Wednesday night he was over at my place and excused himself to go to the bathroom. I heard his phone ding and looked down, not because I was purposefully trying to snoop but because NOISE. I saw it was a text from a girl. That’s not what bothered me though. What bothered me were the first two words of the text notification, “Hey Baby….”. Not sure of what to think, I jotted down her name really quick. He came back from the bathroom, we had a nice night, he wasn’t weird or protective of his phone, but I really wanted to know who this girl was. 

Now, I’m not one to advocate going out of your way to snoop, but I personally see no problem with if something doesn’t sit right, check it out. So I went to social media and found her name in his follows. His page was mostly posts about activities he does like hiking, camping, or working on his car, no real photos of him or anyone except family.  I saw they had a couple of tagged photos together through her page, mostly group photos, the latest from a few weeks prior, but one stood out. It was a photo of just the two of them with just the number 2 and some heart emojis. It was posted 8 months ago and underneath were a slew of comments saying congratulations. 

So I bit the bullet and messaged her. I spent well over an hour drafting a message trying to not make myself sound like a creep or crazy, and ended up going simple, “Hi, do you know David X?” I of course was on pins and needles for hours waiting for her to respond. I was running every possible answer she might have in my head, and starting to second guess myself, talking myself into how I’m a crazy b*tch. Maybe they dated, broke up, but decided to remain friends? But that “Hey, Baby” still nagged at me. Obviously, you’ve figured out where this is going, and sure enough when she eventually responds late that night, she says, “He’s my bf, why?” 

I could have died right there on the spot. I wrestled with what to do. I was sad and angry for me because I liked this guy, but I was also sad and angry for her if she didn’t know. Ultimately I just told the truth, “I’ve been seeing him for a while and just found out about you. I was under the impression that our relationship was monogamous. Here is my number if you want to talk”. Within ten minutes, we were texting. Turns out they’d been together for over two years. My roommate had no idea he even had a girlfriend. She had never seen her or heard him talk about her.

We talked about the basics, how long they’d been together, how we met, how long we’ve been together and so on. I figured out that we mostly met on Wednesdays because that was the day she was most often at work. I couldn’t stop apologizing. I felt awful both for me and for her, and we agreed to meet in person to talk more. 

We met at a cafe downtown. I’ll never forget she ordered a coffee and when it was my turn to order I told her, “I think I’m going to need a beer for this conversation.” She actually ended up ordering a cocktail. She said she hadn’t told David she knew about me yet. She had made excuses not to see him. I told her I hadn’t said anything yet either, figuring I would defer to whatever she wanted. I asked if she had any thoughts about staying, and she said “Hell no. Fuck him.” I asked what she wanted me to do. I was trying to be respectful of what she wanted and how she wanted to handle the situation. She looked me dead in the face and said, “I want him to see us in the same room.” I’m not one for confrontation. Like at all, and I wasn’t expecting this to be how she wanted to handle it. The idea scared me shitless, but I agreed to it because somehow I felt like I owed it to her? She texted David right there asking if he wanted to come over later that night, and he said sure. We ended up having a few more drinks and continued to talk. I think in a messed up way we found camaraderie in each other and by the end we were both sad but cracking jokes at his expense. 

We met up later at her place, about 30 minutes before David was set to come. We had a few more drinks for liquid courage, me more than her probably. I drank a lot of wine that night. He arrived and she opened the door. He stepped into the living room to see me sitting on the sofa. He went pale, like absolutely freakishly pale. He didn’t say a word. He just turned and left, slamming the door on his way out. She ran after him screaming, “Got nothing to say? Seriously? Screw you!” 

We sat for a while, passing what an asshole he was back and forth, and we hugged before I left. I went home and had an embarrassing level cry. Full blown ugly, snotty sobbing. I didn’t expect to hear from her again, and I didn’t plan on reaching out. But then a couple of days later, she texts me. Saying that the news was out on both sides of their families and David was pissed. David ended up harassing both of us for a few weeks saying we ruined his life because I guess his parents decided to cut him off financially. He had apparently told them he was trying to save up for an engagement ring and they offered to help supplement the bills while he did that. Whether or not there was any plan to actually buy a ring, I have no idea. His ex and I ended up texting every time he reached out to one of us, and we actually slowly built a friendship over those weeks. We started grabbing drinks to go over the messages he would send us or the things we would hear. I would give her updates from my roommate who he worked with, and she still stayed in touch with his mom off and on. We have no idea if David had any other girls or if it was just me. But at least for us two, there’s a happy ending…

She’s now one of my closest friends and we’re now both in happy and stable relationships. She got married four years ago to a great guy and I went to the wedding with my current partner. We’re able to laugh about how we met now, especially since this isn’t the usual outcome to stories like this. 

Also David if you read this, thanks for helping me find a friend, but still fuck you.

Edit: since this post got a bit more attention than I was expecting, I sent the link to my friend. She’s loving you guys comments! And she wants me to make one edit…

David, if you read this, thanks for helping us BOTH find a friend, but still, from the bottom of BOTH our hearts, FUCK YOU.

"I landed a dream job, but now I'm being let go because a guy I rejected is falsely accusing me of being inappropriate.","Hi, throwaway for obvious reasons. This has been a devastating past few days, and I’m trying to figure out how to move forward. I have proof of all of this and am prepared to present it.

I (28f) landed a dream job that involves occasional travel. This role was promised to go on for several years, though I’m only away for a few days each month. I met Paul (not his real name obv) (28m) the first weekend I was on the job, and he seemed super nice. For context, I have a partner whom I've been with for nearly five years, and despite his job making us long distance for the first half of this year, our relationship is strong.

On my second trip, during a day off, I began chatting with Paul, and we hit it off. He seemed emotional, sweet, and didn’t make me feel weird in the slightest. I brought up my partner right away, and we talked about his recent breakup. I mentioned that things were difficult with my partner being away, but that they would be fine. Nothing felt out of line until the end of the night, when Paul asked if I would go back to where he was staying with him. I said no, but he persisted 3 or 4 more times, and I firmly said no every time. I went back to where I was staying, and he had found my Instagram, followed me, liked a bunch of my pictures, and sent me 3 DMs asking me to come to his hotel room. I did not respond.

The next day he apologized, and I decided to forgive him and move on. I still liked hanging out with him and the rest of the team and didn’t want to start any drama. I deeply cared about the job. He would text here and there, but never with anything sexual. I genuinely thought we had moved past it, and as months went on, our relationship felt extremely pleasant. Occasionally he would say something flirty or sweet, but I’d brush it off—it felt harmless. I became really good friends with another girl at work, and the three of us kind of became a unit. He would message me when he was heading to grab food so we could all have it as a group, and everything seemed completely normal. 

On the final day of my last trip, he messaged me at meals to see if I wanted to join him and, at the end of the night, even offered to help me transport some heavy things after he was already done with work (our job requires long hours). While we were walking, he asked about my relationship, and I told him that things were going much better. My partner and I were communicating better, he was home, and I felt better than ever about it.

I left, and everything seemed normal. He texted me while I was in the airport heading home and said things like, ""You should come hang out in \[where he lives\]"" and ""I would be so much happier if you and \[other friend\] both lived here."" Everything was super nice and normal feeling.

A few days later, he messaged me again, and when I asked how he was doing, he told me that he was dealing with some mental health stuff. He had gotten a bipolar diagnosis and was changing his medication to see if that would help. I sent him messages of support, and that was that.

A few days ago (about a week since we last texted), I received a shocking email from my bosses. Apparently, he had gone to his bosses, saying that I had been inappropriate with him. To quote directly, he stated that we were friends, but recently there was an incident where i had crossed the line and been inappropriate, and he was uncomfortable with me returning. And because of this, they were not going to have me return to the job. This shocked me to my core. I have never been accused of something like this, and I take it very seriously.

I have zero clue what incident he is even referring to, as the last time I was on a trip, we were never even alone together, except when he helped me carry stuff.

It’s apparent to me that the entire time he was attempting to manipulate me into cheating on my boyfriend and sleeping with him. It seems as though, when he realized this was no longer possible, in his mind, I became a bitch who must be destroyed.

He is attempting to ruin my relationship with my employers, my reputation by painting me as some kind of predator, my mental health, my finances, and has made me feel extremely violated. He has stolen a dream from me, and all I have done is be nice and supportive to him. The email from my bosses made it seem as though I was some kind of crazy person who is obsessed with him when this is not at all the truth (and I have the receipts to prove it). Just to add to the crazy, I recently saw that he sent me TikToks less than 24 hours before I received this email from my bosses. Meaning that he likely sent me those AFTER reporting me.

I have already responded to my bosses and said that I would like to have a Zoom call with them to explain my side of things and that the only one who ever behaved inappropriately was Paul.

My question is: what are my rights? Where the hell do I go from here? My dreams feel ruined, I’ve barely been able to eat or sleep. I feel so wronged and angry. I’m planning on writing a statement to read to my bosses and have all screenshots lined up and ready to show them.

**Update 1:*** firstly thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it. Especially people who also shared their stories, it means a lot and i’m so sorry. I think my post was a bit confusing (i’ll update it slightly for clarify)- in the email from my bosses they did inform me that “because i make him uncomfortable, they are taking me off the job”. This is only because he has more seniority and security at the company and is obviously bullshit. Second, tomorrow night i am meeting with an employment lawyer. i’ll let everyone know how that goes. Oh and i have screenshots of everything :) Thank you and KEEP RECEIPTS. 

**TLDR:** I (28f) landed a dream job that involves occasional travel. A coworker made advances toward me, which I rejected. Despite this, we stayed friends, and everything seemed fine. Recently, he falsely accused me of being inappropriate with him, resulting in me being let go from my position. I’m shocked and devastated, as he’s ruined my dream job, reputation, financial stability, and mental health. I’m preparing to defend myself to my bosses, but I’m unsure of my next steps.",TwoXChromosomes,2101,1723411084.0,169,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1epvrdz/i_landed_a_dream_job_but_now_im_being_let_go/
"Husband Died, Now Creep Neighbor is Lurking Again","Several years ago, when our daughter was a baby, my husband and I became friends with a neighbor down the street who also had a young daughter and similar interests as my husband. 

He is a single dad who has his daughter half of the time. Prior to the pandemic, he and my husband would hang out in the garage, ride motorcycles together, etc. We went to church with him a few times. He’s very, very Christian. Gave us bibles with our names on them. 

He had girlfriends occasionally and we would socialize as a group. Since he didn’t have family around, we would invite him to join us for Christmas or thanksgiving, sometimes Easter. 

Then the pandemic happened. I stayed home with the kids. My work dried up. My husband had to go into the office every day as a first responder. Since there was nothing open, the kids were going stir crazy. I’d take them out to play every afternoon. 

Looking back, it was like clockwork, he would come out at 4 to chat. Sometimes other neighbors would be out. It was nice to have social time. My husband would get home, talk a little bit, then go inside. 

I didn’t think anything of it. Unfortunately, this is when my husband’s drinking problem escalated. Neighbor took notice of my husband being gone or inside, and I was so lonely from being locked inside with two young kids all day. I was happy to talk to anyone. 

Unfortunately, I didn’t realize me talking to him was giving him the idea I was interested in him. I never told him anything other than I was frustrated with my husband not wanting to come out and hang out with everyone. I let him know I felt alone, and if my husband was being distant with him. He said no. I let creep neighbor know the pandemic was hard and my work was drying up. 

So he hired me to take a portrait of him and his daughter. I was excited because it was the first work I had all year. (I am a creative and have a photo and design service.) When I got to his house to set up, he wasn’t ready and his daughter wasn’t there, I asked if he wanted to reschedule, he said no. 

The session took a long time because he kept stalling and going upstairs for an extended period of time. I should have told him to hurry up or I’d be breaking down and going back home. He claims he can’t decide what to wear. I knew better than to go upstairs alone with him. Something felt off. 

During the phot session, he claimed he couldn’t button his top collar button and asked me to help. I didn’t feel comfortable and reached out, but it wouldn’t move, I withdrew my hands and felt icky. Then rushed to try and end the session. 

When I got home, my husband was mad at me (and drunk) accusing me of sleeping with the neighbor. I was aghast and shocked. He said I took too long and was dressed too nice to be over there. And said neighbor had stopped texting him several months ago. I had no idea neighbor was only communicating with me. He always told me he texted me and my
Husband. It was heated arguments between us for two weeks and I stopped communicating with the neighbor, realizing he had crossed several boundaries and was coming onto me. 

My husband and I tested a theory he had that I was being watched on the cameras. My husband would leave for a walk, intentionally going by the neighbor’s house and within 5 minutes I would get a “how are you?” Or “do the kids want to play text.” 

My husband and I wrote letters to him and said the friendship was over, and not to talk to us again. He complies, it’s super awkward, but it’s obvious is intimidated by my husband and leaves us alone. 

At the end of last year, my husband’s addiction led to him ending his life. I am in shock, my life is upended. Despite the addiction, I loved my husband and was trying to get him help for several years. I always held out hope he would seek treatment, it was too late by the time he did. The withdrawal caused him severe side effects. This is horrible. Nothing I would wish on anyone. 

Word gets out (though I tried to keep it private) that he has died. Neighbors avoid me and I’m fine with that. I don’t want to interact with anyone. 

Two weeks ago, I’m walking my dogs and they start barking at bikers. I hold them back and mind my business. When I get into the house with them, I see creep neighbor, on his bike, talking with people across the street from me. I shut the blinds so he can’t see into my house. 

I clean up, and as I go to leave, creep neighbor is now outside his house taking to more neighbors. I make it a point to look, with RBF expressions and get into the car. Rub my errands. Feel great about getting out of the house and living despite my deep grief. 

When I get back, there is a card on my front door. I grab it, set it aside and don’t pay it any mind. The next day, I open it and it’s from creep neighbor, expressing how much my husband meant to him, and it’s signed by him and his daughter (his writing, not hers). Asking to be friends again. Then a large, personal check falls out. 

What the actual fuck?!?!?!?!? I have been punched in the gut, my husband is dead! His friend betrayed him by coming on to me. We asked him to leave us alone. Now my husband is dead and creep neighbor thinks he can talk to me again?!? I’m livid! Absolutely disgusted. And fuck his money, I don’t want it, even if I needed it!! 

I will destroy the card and check, but what the fuck do I do? I hate this man. He betrayed my husband. He betrayed our family. He nearly destroyed my marriage. I was in therapy for months after the incident. He is a fake Christian for “coveting thy neighbor’s wife”. He thinks he can buy me? What the fuck? 

He’s a busybody, and touts his Christianity so other neighbors think he is a “good man” so it’s my word against his. I’m a heathen who doesn’t go to church. My neighborhood is heavily Christian. I’m definitely an outsider. 

Moving is not an option as I’m now a widow, trying to make it work. I plan to ignore him. And not address the card or check. If he tries to talk to me, I plan to say, “No.” and remove myself from the conversation or area. 

I have cameras on the house, but I’m constantly fearful because I know he’s watching. 

If you made it this far, thank you. I just need to get this off my chest and in writing somewhere. ",TwoXChromosomes,1563,1740998320.0,140,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1j2fv9o/husband_died_now_creep_neighbor_is_lurking_again/
I no longer pass as a man and I'm having weird gender feelings,"I am a tall cis woman and until recently I had short hair.  My usual attire is jeans and a flannel shirt.  In the daytime, my gender presentation is mostly female (on rare occasions someone will take a quick glance, address me as sir, and apologize shortly after), but on a dimly lit street I'm consistently mistaken for a man.  

I went for a walk tonight and it was cold enough that I had to take my hair down to wear a hat.  It was the first time in years of walking at night that I've not felt like I was passing as a man.  I very literally thought, ""Oh, shit!  I'm not passing!""  It was surprisingly disturbing.  I hadn't realized the extent to which being perceived as a man made me feel safe.  I had gotten used to being perceived as a threat (women walking alone and sometimes even couples would clock me a few paces behind them and become visibly vigilant).  I adapted to crossing the street or taking an extra turn to avoid making others anxious.  Sometimes I crossed paths with men who would greet me with a friendly, ""Sup, bro.""  On those occasions, I'd respond and on hearing my voice they'd immediately apologize for misgendering me.  I never felt bad about being mistaken for a man.  

It felt good.  Hell, being addressed as ""sir"" in shops felt good.  The tone of it was respectful in a way that I have never experienced while perceived as a woman.  I have friendly interactions on a regular basis, but I've never had that type of deference directed at me as a woman.

I've had students refer to me with they/them pronouns and I was always more bemused than anything else.  I feel pretty firmly attached to she/her pronouns, but I also feel an odd sense of loss at the idea of always being perceived as female.  

I guess I'm wondering, do other cis women feel this way?  Should I open myself to thinking of myself as genderfluid or genderqueer?  Am I just reacting to a desire for safety and respect?  I'd really appreciate perspectives from cis, trans, and non-binary folks.  Does any of this ring a bell?


Edit: Holy moly, I didn't expect more than a handful of responses!  Thank you to everyone who shared their experiences and offered advice.  I have a lot of food for thought.

My fawn response went to fight and it shocked both of us,"(TW: assault)

So, hey, posting from a cool hot place of trauma, absolutely NO WORRIES if you need to skip this. …which is objectively a funny sentence to write considering the title of this post.

A couple things to know: I smoke on my front stoop and often get dudes trying to chat me up. No biggie on that, shoot your shot my guy, just leave me alone when I say no or are clearly disinterested. I’ve also been doing fight training for the past couple years, and I live with two roommates who are women.

Now, if you go through my post history, you’ll see I’m a sword lady. In fact, last week, I performed a sword fighting show (three shows a day for three days) that also used hand-to-hand combat - obvs I know stage combat is not the same as real combat, but my body is strong, I know how to move, and having been training for a bit, I carry myself differently.

At my core I’m a kind person, and I like swords and fighting in a fun, playful way. My fight partner is legit one of the loveliest people I’ve ever met, everyone I know in the fight community is equally awesome, we’re mostly just big ol’ goobers who happen to have Studied The Blade.

Cut to late at night in front of my apartment. I’m smoking (yes I should quit), and a guy rolls up and starts chatting. I’m really just trying to listen to 80s music and plot out a fanfic I’m writing but this guy decides he needs to be A Man.

He tells me he’s seen me around the neighbourhood. He’s seen my roommates around the neighbourhood (he had a nickname for one of them due to her distinctive hair). It escalated quickly: he tells me either he rapes me or I fight him.

Here’s me in front of the door to my apartment. I stowed my headphones and phone in one bra cup, put my cigarettes in the other bra cup, and said, “Fight.”

Now I know - my darlings I know - the best fight is the one you avoid. I would never search out violence. In fact the DM of my current Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign makes fun of us for always trying to make friends instead of going into combat. And here’s someone I don’t know inciting said violence - does he have weapons on him? I have no idea. Does he have pals nearby? Again, no clue. But he gave me a choice between rape and fighting and implicated my roommates in front of my goddamn apartment so I chose fight.

And this guy backs off immediately. I don’t know if he was trying to be “funny” by intimidating me, or he assumed I wouldn’t speak up, but he shrunk like Alice in a Wonderland not of his choosing.

That was so dangerous, but less dangerous than fawning, which I usually do. I felt like a dog protecting its home: it’s one thing to intimidate me, but another to threaten my friends who are sleeping peacefully and don’t need any of (waves hands wildly) this.

He called me a bitch and rode away on his bike. Fine. I’m a bitch. I guess mostly because I have that dog in me.

A few takeaways from this:

1) This really fucked me up and I still feel scared, even though he’s not a threat anymore. But he might be? What if he comes back with his bruised ego and a weapon? He knows where I live. I don’t think he will, but one never knows. I’m lucky that I know my neighbours and the hood likes me, so I’ve been telling people about him, and have had very kind reassurances from my block.

2) I am so glad my body is strong enough after so much work that it’s like “Oh fuck you” when threatened. I didn’t freeze, I didn’t fawn, and I’m used to doing only those. There is absolutely &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; wrong with using either of those survival tactics (10/10 would still use both in different situations) but wow, I didn’t realize how strong I’d become and how differently my vagus nerve would react until put in this situation.

3) I’m smoking on my front stoop as I write this. Been meaning to make a point-and-click horror game about smoking on my stoop and I think I finally have a boss battle.",TwoXChromosomes,1918,1723522625.0,178,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1eqyrev/my_fawn_response_went_to_fight_and_it_shocked/
"A simple explanation of why compliments, greetings and other ""innocuous"" greetings are not as harmless to women walking down the street as people seem to think.","Between the original video and the parody one, I see a lot of the same reactions, generally from men. ""But that's not catcalling! Lots of people just wanted to say hi or good morning!"" ""She gets more compliments in 10 hours than I get all year."" ""How am I supposed to get to know someone if I can't even say hello?"" ""Ok, maybe being talked to is annoying, but come on...harassment?"" and ""Oh, yeah, it must be REALLY HARD being attractive.""  I get it. I understand that when you haven't experienced something, it's hard to understand. So I'd like to give to a brief explanation as to WHY it feels so awful to be shouted at every few minutes while you are just trying to exist in this world. 

Let's pretend you have something lots of people want. Maybe you're famous or rich or powerful. In fact, let's go with something lots of people on reddit understand: let's say you're a whiz at computers. You've always been great at them, and when you hit college you finally decided to make it your career. 

Of course, people know you're a whiz. When you were in high school, your parents always had you fix their computer, and maybe they made you go over to your grandparents house and teach them how to do simple stuff on it. It wasn't a big deal, and you liked using your skill to make other people happy. It made you feel good to be acknowledged for your talents, too.

But as you've grown, your social circle has widened, and now that it's your career path, everyone knows that you're a whiz. And the requests start coming more often. Your friend thinks he has a virus. Your cousin who you never speak to is having an issue getting his printer to work. A facebook ""friend"" wants to make a wordpress site and heard you were good at that. Your brother in law just can't get his wireless router set up. 

It starts to really grate on you. You recognize a pattern...someone whom you don't talk to that often will send you text, email or facebook message, and it always starts off nicely with the ""how are you""s, but within 3 or 4 minutes of small talk they will get to what they really want. You realize that the more you do for people, the more they want; and if you accommodate everyone, you would never have any time for yourself. So you decide to start being more assertive and tell people (nicely) ""no.""

Well, that was a fucking mistake. There is now hostility in your family because no one can understand why you were so rude to Uncle Joe, it would have just taken you a half hour to set up his new monitor, why would you be such a dick about it? And now you've been unfriended on Facebook by several people, your boss is pissed and you're worried now about job prospects down the line. 

You obviously handled that poorly, you think. But you're still unwilling to spend 5-10 hours a week doing favors for people who seem pretty ungrateful, so you just change the way you deal with requests. You don't sign on to social media much anymore, and emails keep getting ""lost."" You try to ignore as many requests in as many ways as possible, thinking that if you don't say no, people won't get angry. Weeeeell, that was a lost cause. People are just as mad as before. In fact, it seems that the only thing that will make people happy is to do what they're asking...no one seems to care how this impacts you, because they just want what they want when they want it. 

This starts to color all of your other interactions. Now, every time an old friend randomly wants to reconnect with you, you get a knot in your stomach. You read emails knowing that at the end of all of the sucking up and small talk,  there's a good chance for an ask at the end. And because you've had so many hostile reactions when you tried to stand up for yourself, all of these reactions are now colored with that. Maybe your old middle school crush really is just trying to say hi, but you've been through this before and you know the odds are on the fact that she wants something from you. This is now the way you look at most people. It wears you down. You don't understand why people can't respect your right to just be left alone, and why you can't find a space that is free from all the asks. You know your dread at seeing a simple facebook message seems unreasonable, but damn. If people only understood how many you get, and what it has led to. It's become a big thing in your life somehow, and you fucking hate it.

Now, this little comparison isn't really the best, because it doesn't deal with the actual scary shit that women get constantly...being followed in the streets, sometimes with people in cars. A guy walking down the street and putting his arm around you while he starts a conversation. The touching. The slurs of ""slut,"" ""cunt,"" or ""whore"" when you ignore someone. The threats. The occasional actual violence. 

So yeah, I guess some people see someone saying, ""Mmmmmm...good morning, mami!"" as a nice greeting. But when it is constant, when it is colored with years of experience, when you JUST WANT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET AND LIVE YOUR LIFE....it is gross. So gross. Someone earlier mocked the fact that it was only 100 example of harassment in 600 minutes. When you have random strangers (an ALL men) talking to you every five minutes, when it seems like they all want something from you and there is no good way to respond to it, a simple twenty minute stroll just becomes exhausting.

Sorry for the length of this, and I doubt anyone will read this novel I've just written, but I wanted to explain why this feels the way the way it does for people who simply can't sympathize. I hope this maybe helps a couple of people understand why even ""innocent"" interactions feel very charged for the women who experience them.",TwoXChromosomes,2979,1414672774.0,2877,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2kry4i/a_simple_explanation_of_why_compliments_greetings/
Talk please just talk.,"Hello all,
I love my wife and our relationship has not been easy, her friends didn't like me (actively warned her off) my parents did not warm to her and her parents disowned her for getting a boyfriend without approval add to that the day we met she was on the rebound that afternoon dumped by her last BF.

We had no money, no clue and here we are almost 23 years later still together and still in love, we have dealt with cancer and now full renal failure, I am giving her home dialysis (I turned the lounge into a bedroom with full access to a 55"" TV hooked up to a gaming pc, oculus rift, gear VR, Alexa etc and all her crafting stuff).

What made it possible for us to go through all the tragedy and hardship we did?

We talked.
Three days into our relationship my mum was working a night shift and I invited her over once mum left, I know what you're thinking a hot night of sex, actually, all we did was go up to my room and cuddle on my single bed talking.

We discussed everything, it was the scariest event in my life, we told each other our flaws, we discussed past problems, we discussed likes desires and fetishes, we discussed our sexuality and my debts, nothing was hidden nothing was judged, we discussed every subject from hentai to Cthulhu and bared our souls to each other.

Before we knew it morning came and we were still together, so talk early in your relationship, let them know everything about you, if they run then it was never meant to be, if they stay then you have a chance and if there is something in your life you can not share with this person you want to spend the rest of your life with then honestly ask yourself why.

Talk before you waste half your life just talk and find out if this is real and right.

A lot of the problems we see in this place could be solved by talking.

Love isn't easy, love isn't like in the movies it takes effort, communication and time, with the right person the harshest of tragedies will bring you closer together not force you apart.

------
Thank you, everyone, for your good wishes and to hear from others who have experienced this is great, like everyone is saying it takes effort, sadly it is so much easier to not talk and it can be scary but it will tell you very quickly if this is the right person.

You can have completely different jobs, hobbies and come from completely different sides of the world but if you can communicate if you can share and talk no one loses out.

My mum had a picture on her wall and it said something like ""it's not just about looking at each other sometimes it's about looking in the same direction""

------
A couple of people have asked why I posted this here and not somewhere else, I have read this subreddit for a long time posted a little but have seen so many problems that could have been helped, I see amazing people who for many reasons get into situations that cause them life-changing problems, I see trapped people who are pushed to a point they have to fight back to save themselves and in reading a lot of the history at least some, just a few if even just one person reads this and can sort out problems before it gets to a bad point or get out before the damage is done then to me its a good thing.

Reading all these responses from couples who made it work by talking who did the same we did makes me so happy and if that can be an example to anyone who is trying to work through problems then thank you all for posting.

That is why I posted it here because over time I have seen so many problems that talking could have helped before things got bad.

Thank you to all for the amazing good wishes.

This is amazing, never expected to get this kind of response, It was early morning and I just finished a post on the Dialysis sub, it is all still new to me and a big thing to take on at home, my wife was still asleep (night time dialysis) and I was just thinking about everything we have faced together over the last 20 years, I started to think about what really matters and how much we still love each other and how much talking matters.

Wanted to pass on something to help others.

My wife is an amazing woman who I always wish that I could do more for, I guess that comes with being a carer for someone, I have heard it from others, you never feel like you do enough, you can't take the pain away you can't heal the illness, it does not matter that rational tells you people far smarter than yourself can't fix it.

Ever since she got ill halfway through college she never complains even though she has every right too and look at me if I get flu or a cold I am terrible but she is dealing with Cancer, Diabetes, Arthritis and now a full renal failure and she still manages to smile and fight it all.

Damn woman is a hero in my eyes yes maybe I am biased but honestly never known anyone who has been dealt such a rough card.

Her birthday is coming up soon and I am still trying to figure out a surprise for her, my main idea was trying to get a letter or something from her favorite actors or shows but getting in touch with film and TV type people seems to be almost impossible these days which is understandable.

Time for me to cook although I may just order take out tonight, thank you to all of you who responded to this, you really did make my day.

-------

A couple of people asked about my wife's illness. 
21 years ago while at college she fainted on her way to class after months of misdiagnosis we finally found out it was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia with Philadelphia Chromosome positive, this is classed as a childhood cancer and in children, it is easier to treat but in an adult with the Philadelphia positive it is incurable.

They did chemo then removed some of her bone marrow then blasted her body with radiation killing off her marrow then reintroduced her ""cleaned"" marrow they had removed, this was all to force her into short-term remission.

At this point, she was put on Interferon alpha 2b which kept a certain protein at a certain level meaning cancer did not come back but that medication caused a lot of side effects including Arthritis and muscle wastage, we coped with that okay for 19 years I became her primary carer.

For some reason, that medication just stopped working and the counts started to rise, we went on to Imatinib which once again kept the cancer away but the side effects hit her like a truck.

Diabetes type 2 kicked in and her counts became really unstable, then this Christmas her Kidneys started to fail, tests were done and no way to stop it, they hoped with the support she could last 18 months but her Kidneys began to fail in February and went down to 8% functionality which caused a huge increase in liquid mass in the body, her legs alone gained 8kg of water meaning she could not even raise them off the floor, the liquid quickly began to encircle her organs and lungs, that is when she ended up in hospital.

3 weeks in hospital (came home on the 25th April) I turned the living room into a bedroom, I was trained up on home dialysis Peritoneal and now her counts are slowly going in the right direction but it will take months before she can walk again even in the house.

Unfortunately, she can not have a transplant because whatever damaged her kidneys so badly and quickly is still around and if it is the medication keeping the cancer away its sort of a mute point.

-----

Someone mentioned doing something for my wife's birthday, I would love to but I have no idea how that would be possible to do so safely or even allowed, someone with a lot more knowledge in this kind of thing would have to advise me but thank you for the offer and idea.

-----

This has been a wonderful day thank you, I just helped set up wife on Dialysis and waited till she was sleepy before coming upstairs (promised her I would start gaming and enjoying myself on the computer again, I have skyrim VR and a good setup but spending 99% of my time with her, I know its good to have a break and I need not burn myself out).

As people liked the words from one of my mum's pictures I remembered another one ""it's not the breaths we take that measure our life but the moments that take our breath away"" I always really loved that one.

I have never believed in love at first sight simply because a person's looks can change, physical attraction is okay for a fling or fun but for love well I do believe in love at first talk, that first night with my now wife sitting in a club talking for 6 hours like no one else existed, I just knew this was the person for me.

-----

If this is against any rules please just edit this part of the post out, a lot of people have asked how they can help or if they can do something for my wife's birthday in June, so I have added an Amazon wishlist to my profile and chucked everything we are planning for in the future, no one has to look no one has to do anything, I am only putting it on there because people asked and suggested, if this is against anything in this sub please remove this part, because this post is doing a lot of good and goes beyond anything else.

----

I have had some very interesting discussions in relation to this post, thank you so much, I want to add a couple of points due to those conversations.

I hope and I have tried in no way to beat the male drum in this post, if my wife was not ill she would have posted this herself, she has read it and from either of our perspectives the lessons about talking, trust, respect and honesty which make up communication come from both of us, it was not me or her who pushed for open lines of communication it just happened together, I also know that communication can not fix every problem and not all situations are salvagable but no matter what happens going in or out with eyes and ears open is a good survival trait.

Someone mentions how this would not go as well if you were broke.

When she got ill I was working for a basic wage at a small computer shop fixing problems, she was at college, we had no emergency fund and very quickly I understood she needed 24/7 help so we talked and I became her carer, this was a joint decision.

Things have never really gotten any better financially except we budget really well, we do not smoke or go out, we do not own a car and have not been on holiday for 19 years, fortunately, the house we are in now while not perfect is ours, we have learnt to save up over time and buy things on sale, to avoid impulse buys and instead take time to think about it while saving up, yes we have a well kitted out house of technology but all of those things were budgeted for and when you are stuck in the house 99% of the time Books, games, films and tv shows become a lot more important, when you can no longer even go down a local street then a powerful computer with Virtual reality is amazing.

People say they can't save but spend £50 at the weekend on drink its all about priorities, our priorities have always been making the house as entertaining as possible and make sure we have personal space because you may think to stay in isn't too bad and it is not until you can't physically step outside the front door and a 20 year prison sentence is not good for anyone.

She is the best of me and challenges me to be the best I can be.

As no one has shouted at me it seems to be okay me having a wish list in my profile but I wanted to explain a couple of items on the list, we have a few lifx bulb paired with our first gen echo in her bedroom this means if she wakes up during the night she can activate the lights both her own and mine if she needs me, unfortunately both are a little worse for wear out of warranty and only respond 60% of the time, its on my to do list.

The other unusual item is the bbq, I am currently working on the garden in my spare time so she can spend time outside and paired with her high protein diet (dialysis) removes it from the body, it seems like a no brainer, foil wrapped fish with mushrooms onions and peppers anyone.

Once again I am only putting that on my profile and mentioning it because people asked, all are on our budget and to do list and will get done anyway.

Inadvertently got a creep at work to leave me alone,"I'm on a new weld line, in a new area of the plant. I'm not to familiar with the 6 people around me but one gave off super weird vibes.

He complimented my hair, which is newly pink orange and purple, and super long, which I expect from strangers. It looks great!

The next night he comes up to me and asks if I like mermaids. At this point I'm gauging where he is at mentally, cause that's a weird way to start a conversation with a person you don't know, and his cadence when he speaks is a bit slower.

Then he pokes me right in the shoulder and says ""you should get one tattooed right here!""...... I'm wearing a men's undershirt (or A shirt? I think they're called?), and he just jabs me. I'm immediately on guard and say I have plans for that area and he accepts this and walks away.

Fast forward about two hrs and he comes up to me again and asks ""Can I call you foxy?""

""Uh. No? I'm not a fox, and do you even know the horrible sound they make?"" and I literally start screeching and making crazy ass noises. Right. In. His. Face.

He kinda goes ""Oh... Uh. Okay."" and leaves.

I tell my line lead and found out that creep has stalked two women he knows of, one quit without reporting him and the other one's husband scared him so bad he left her alone after that... But he still knows where they live.

So, trust your gut ladies. I knew the moment he touched me I didn't like where this could go. Thankfully, I'm a bit of a crazy person who will do awkward things to make people feel weird and leave me alone.

If he does or says anything sideways again I'm getting a supervisor involved. I know I should have with the foxy comment, but I feel like my screeching was an obvious sign to leave me alone.

We shall see. I'll update this story as needed. I just needed to share this story because these little red flags get brushed off. Hell, even I was making internal excuses thinking he had developmental issues until calling me foxy.

LISTEN TO YOUR GUT not your rationalization of what their behavior could mean.

Edit: I had the naive idea not to report this creepy incident, but you're all correct in getting the paper trail started. I'll speak with my area lead and foreman Sunday night when I go in. Thank you all for pointing out my reaction will not be the next person's reaction and I'd hate myself if I found out that he creeped on anyone else. Thank you for the confidence boost. I can do this. I won't let them make me feel bad for feeling unsafe.",TwoXChromosomes,4929,1570880446.0,377,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dgu1mr/inadvertently_got_a_creep_at_work_to_leave_me/
Just because he's on the spectrum doesn't mean he should get a free pass to stalk and harrass you,"This happened about 5 years ago but my cousin just had something similar happen to her and it brought my frustration back all over again. Sorry if this isn't the right sub 

I used to work at a well known shoe store and everyone loved my boss. Hell, I did too at first. He loved joking around and didn't seem to take things too seriously which was a nice change from my previous job of being a waitress. About 6 months after starting, my boss hired Jimmy (not his real name). Jimmy has autism and we all did our best to make him feel welcome and feel a part of our team. At first, he was cool. A little odd but he was funny and we all enjoyed working with him. That is, until us girls started noticing some disturbing behavior.    

Throughout the day, part of our job was to walk up and down the isles to straighten and organize the shelves of shoes that customers had either left strewn across the floor or put in the wrong place. One day, I noticed Jimmy peaking around the corner just staring at me. When he noticed me looking, he ran off. I thought it was a little weird but continued working and quickly forgot about it. The next work day, I kept getting the feeling that someone was watching me but there would be no one around. 

When I started getting more paranoid about it, I noticed Jimmy was again hiding behind the rows of shoes just standing there and staring at me. I started noticing that he was following me around the store. I would say things to him like ""hey, this is my area to clean, thanks for the help but I have it covered! You should probably go check on your area"" in the hopes that he was just looking for something to do and was too shy to ask or something. That is until one of my female coworkers came up to me and asked if Jimmy was following me around the store, too. Apparently, not only had he been following me around, but all the other girls as well. It made us all extremely uncomfortable. I decided I was going to say something because it wasn't just me at this point. 

When I went to my boss and explained the situation, he laughed. He told me that we all know Jimmy was autistic and that we were over reacting. That he probably had a little crush on us and didn't know how to deal with it but he was harmless so don't worry about it. He made me feel like I was just being a bitch and that I was judging him because he was on the spectrum. I needed the job so I sucked it up.  

Over time, his stalking got worse and, because he knew we had complained and nothing came of it, he got more brazen. He was no longer hiding behind shelves to watch us work, he would stand right behind us while we worked on shelves and openly follow us around and not do any work. It's like he was getting paid to follow and ogle us. He would follow us out to our cars at night and we would soon be seeing him follow us around places like Walmart or McDonald's. 

After awhile, we all decided to talk to our boss together. None of us felt safe at work and it was getting to the point where some of us didn't even feel safe at home. Again, our boss made light of it and tried to guilt us all for judging someone on the spectrum. It was at this point that I started looking for another job. 

I had planned to stay on until I had another job lined up but instead, I ended up quitting on the spot. Blatantly, in front of customers and coworkers, with a big smile on his face, he grabbed my ass. He squeezed me so hard it actually hurt a bit. I asked him what the hell was wrong with him and he just laughed and said that it was ok because he's autistic and doesn't know any better. That was it, the final straw. I walked to my locker, gathered my things and left without looking back. 

Now that I'm older, I wish I would have gotten the police involved. I wish I had stuck up for myself better, that I had protected my coworkers from this creep. Instead, I was guilted, shamed, and ran away. I can't change the past but I'm hoping my story can change someone's future. Just because someone is on the spectrum, doesn't mean they can get away with sexual assault. It doesn't give them a free pass to do as they please. If someone makes you uncomfortable, please speak up.


Edit: Thank you all so much for your overwhelming support! I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it has. For all of you who have shared your stories, thank you. Thank you for showing me and others that we are not alone. For those of you on the spectrum and are speaking out, thank you for your support and understanding.",TwoXChromosomes,5222,1596201942.0,301,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/i17gwz/just_because_hes_on_the_spectrum_doesnt_mean_he/
"My roommate is pressuring me into a threesome, and I clearly don't want it.","My roommate and I have been living together for almost a year now. We're both the same age (23) and have a lot of things in common. At one point we were very close and people even said we look alike. Since both of us were working at a furniture store, it was easier to live together and split the bills. 

A couple of months ago, everyone was notified on WhatsApp not to report to work till further notice. We later found  out our boss had a lot of issues going on and the bank was auctioning  some of her property, including the building where the furniture store was at.That's how we both lost our jobs without even being paid the previous month's salary.

We never thought it would take this long to get a another job. We were both actively  searching for jobs online and in person. I didn't know she had started looking for alternative sources and was considering hook ups. So she met this guy, who happened to be a client from our previous workplace and knew both of us. He has some kind of fetish and was asking her if we could have our hair looking the same and put on same outfit. In short he wanted a threesome with us, looking like twins.

He was willing to pay atleast $300 for each of us, and my roommate tried to convince me into it.
At first I thought, we do it once then just pay some of our debt which will buy us time to clear the rest. But I just can't bring myself to do it. I also don't know how to be intimate with people I have no emotional connection with. And now, my she went from asking me nicely to harassing me saying she'd rather live alone and she'll get me kicked out.

Yesterday I found out she's been talking to the landlord on my back. She's forgotten last month I sold some of my stuff so I could buy food for both of us. Normally, both of us would give $380 to budget for rent and other bills each month. Since last month, none of us had paid our share of the rent and by 10th, we would be owing the landlord two months.

The landlord  knows we both lost our jobs and has been very patient. I don't know what she said for him to threaten to put me out of the house if I don't pay my share on time. She has manipulated the landlord against me and I feel betrayed by her. We're both in the same situation and yet she's only trying to pressure me into agreeing to the threesome. I don't know how I'll get to pay my share, but I am certain this is not what I want. I just don't understand how someone will come up with something like that and just manipulate me to follow through without even considering how I feel about it.
What should I do? Should I just avoid her and forget about this or after getting a job just move out? I had already sold most of my stuff just to keep us going, and now when I'm on my lowest she's turning against me. I have nothing against sex work, it's just something I can't get myself to do. I care about her as a sister but I feel like this time she really went out of line.",TwoXChromosomes,2339,1688557775.0,258,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14r8ezg/my_roommate_is_pressuring_me_into_a_threesome_and/
“No GROWN woman lives like you”,"I posted the following post on another subreddit and got nothing but nasty messages, one in particular stood out. The redditor said I must be a young woman or a teen because “no grown woman lives like you”. As if I’m struggling on purpose. Maybe I’m alone in this but I’m actually in my late 30’s and YES, I know how pathetic my life is right now. So I decided to repost it here hoping I’m not the only one. 


 
On thursday my utilities got turned off. Yes I know about local resources but they are tapped out. I’ve had to play the “pay this or that” game and that didn't make the cut even though running water is an absolute need. I got really lucky that my neighbor is letting my daughter shower before school. I don’t know if that will last as long as it takes me to pay to get it turned back on but I’m hoping. I don’t talk about my medical issues but I have a lovely mix of Crohn's disease, POTS, endometriosis, and fibromyalgia. I started my period two days ago (sorry TMI) and I swear everyday after the first day is hell for me. I use a menstrual cup because it's the most cost effective option. 


Around 10pm my body decided to have a flare up. I don't think I ate anything “wrong” but I knew I needed a bathroom STAT. I wasn't going to bother my neighbor in the middle of the night so I walked to the nearest gas station. Finding a 24 hour bathroom after covid is near impossible in a small town. After three rounds I started to feel light headed and the “sparkles” in my vision started.  


I was trying to remove the cup and it slipped. IFYKYK what a mess that can be. The only thing that helps is laying down. I can’t walk back home yet because I knew I wasn’t done using the bathroom. So the UNISEX bathroom floor is where I laid. I didn’t have time to make a toilet paper layer either. 


Top 3 dirtiest places I’ve found myself and as I was laying there I felt something on my leg. I thought it was just fluids (I know, gross. Sorry). I looked and it was a huge freaking roach on me. Cue the crashout of the century. I did two more rounds and tried cleaning myself up as best I could using gas station toilet paper and the hand dryer. 


I feel absolutely disgusted. I’m sore and inflamed. I’m sitting on the curb praying I can make it home and that I’ll have enough baby wipes to clean myself up better because I hate feeling nasty.

I (F) just discovered my boyfriend made sexual AI images of a girl we both personally know. I’m completely shattered and don’t know what to do.,"I don’t even know how to start this.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We live together. We were talking about our future and marriage. I truly believed he was “my person.”

Last night, I found AI-generated sexual images on his phone… of a girl we actually know in real life. Someone who trusts both of us. The images had those pink X’s to bypass AI filters, but it was obviously sexual.

The moment he sensed that I had seen something, he panicked and started deleting things. Like, instantly. That reaction told me everything.
And what hurts even more is:
this is not the first time he’s done something like this.
He did something similar in the past, cried, apologized, manipulated the situation until I forgave him.

Now I can’t unsee it. I can’t breathe. I’m shaking even writing this.

I had to pretend everything was fine because it was my mother’s birthday. I smiled through the entire evening while something inside me was collapsing.

I feel betrayed, disgusted, unsafe, and confused. I don’t know who I’m living with anymore. I don’t know if I should tell the girl (because she deserves to know), or if that will damage my family and her family. I don’t know if I should report him, leave him, confront him, or quietly walk away.

I’ve saved what evidence I could, because the way he reacted scared me.

I need perspective from people who aren’t emotionally involved.

What should I do?
What legal options exist in India in case I don't want the girls involved to get affected by this?
Am I overreacting or underreacting?
How do I protect myself right now?


I feel so lost in every way. I don't know him or even myself anymore. I can just hear judgement of people how can she be with someone like this? How low are her standards? How is she doing the right thing by not even letting the girls involved know and make decision for themselves?",TwoXChromosomes,640,1762670203.0,135,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1oscbol/i_f_just_discovered_my_boyfriend_made_sexual_ai/
"Was sexually assaulted, called the police. I've never been happier :D","I finally followed my own advice! 

I was walking back home when an old dude stuck his hand down my shirt and between my boobs. (The credit card.) I immediately yell at him and tell him not to touch me and ""why do you think that's acceptable behavior"" etc. 

After I make a fuss, his friends tell me that ""he's drunk"" and ""I should let it go."" Nope, that's for me to decide, not them. He's walking straight and not slurring his words. Just an amplified jackass. 

His friends are cackling and laughing and tell him to apologize to me, and he bows exaggeratedly and throws the most sarcastic, over the top, mocking ""I'm sooo sorrryyy."" I guess from his condescending demeanor that I'm not the first woman he's harassed. And he likely has no problem doing it again. Also, he sexually assaulted me and I'm pissed. 

I tell him to accompany me to the police station, and ofc he refuses. He then exclaims, *""Call the cops, take me to court, sue me, you're only going to end up embarrassing yourself!""* (How my grandma explained it was, in this country, the older generation believes it to be shameful to be sexually assaulted because you were ""probably dressed like a harlot and basically asking for it because only dirty girls get touched."" [Basically what I was wearing, for reference.](http://76.my/Malaysia/w8-32054-long-sleeve-dress-color-black-size-s-m-l-ysystore-1302-02-YSYstore@42.jpg))

Challenge accepted. He knows that most women in this country wouldn't call the cops. Now, I may look like I'm the same people as him, but I grew up in the US and I'm a shameless, bold, unabashed gal from beautiful *America. Too bad for him.

I call the emergency police line and head back. There had to be over 25 police officers that came to my aid--an entire crowd in uniform. They surround the guy, ask him his side of the story and try to get him to calm down. I was instructed to hide somewhere he couldn't see me and identify him as he came out. He's screaming hysterically and yelling at the officers. 

Now, I must admit, the looks on their faces were so satisfying--better than Christmas. They were in utter disbelief that some girl had the *audacity* to get the police involved. To them, it's a harmless prank. She's in a bodycon, so she's asking for it. It's nothing for the police to get involved. It was just a touch, why is it so bad? She obviously enjoys the attention. 

kek.

I expressed that I didn't necessarily want him to get in trouble. I just wanted someone in an authority position to explain to him that in 2015, you're not allowed to touch others sexually without their consent. Most women here definitely would not report such a crime, and the thought that he would do it again to someone not as shameless made me extremely uncomfortable. I didn't want him to get away with it again. 

Anyways, I had to catch the last train home, so the officers gave me a ride to the station. I don't know what happened to the guy, but I don't care too much. It actually took a TON of courage to pick up the phone and dial the police, but I realized that I had nothing to fear. Safety is #1 and, holy moly, did I feel safe with a crowd in uniform. They didn't treat me with victim stigma or like a dirty girl. They were sincere, and seemed like they were glad to help. At one point, I started crying and one of the officers told me to buck up because I had to be strong. The guy was still yelling at the cops and he said that I couldn't lose to him. Good guy officer said exactly what I needed to hear. 

____________________________________________________________

Thanks for reading. Just wanted to share my experience and what I learned. I was so dumb to be more scared of dialing the police and reporting my assailant than actually being assaulted. How silly. 

I also doubted myself for a split second because of the guy's words. But TBH, I actually thought, ""What would 2xc say?"" and IMMEDIATELY snapped out of it. Thanks for reminding me to stand up for myself! 
Getting the authorities involved really helped me understand that I was not only justified in my actions, but also, it blew away any doubts I had before.

TL;DR: Called the cops after being sexually assaulted. I've never been prouder of myself.

Edit 3: I was surprised at the number of respondents too. It would never happen at home in the US, but our crime rate here is ridiculously low. I wouldn't doubt it if there wasn't another incident that night in the area, so I don't believe I was ""taking them away from something more important."" I expected one officer on a bike, and I also really didn't ask for an army. Not all of them stayed the entire time either. As for pressing charges: I return to the US in a little over a week. Personally, I want to enjoy the rest of my time here, and it might be selfish, but I'd rather just spend time with people that I won't be able to see for a while.

What's the proper response??!?? I was too upset to think.,"I was walking my dog (a German Shepherd) about an hour ago when I heard sex/passion noises/talk from the open window of a car that had pulled up next to me. I was at an intersection, thought maybe it was just part of the intro to some song I don't know, and kept going across the street.

It was not the intro to a song I don't know.

It was a man playing porn in his car, following me and masturbating. I couldn't think properly and walked for a little way, trying to stay as far away as possible. He turned the volume up. I crossed another street. He pulled up again. I yelled to get the fuck away from me. He followed me. I ran. He followed and pulled up next to me again. I ignored him as much as I could and finally some people approached (never having seen what was happening). He finally drove off.

I feel so stupid and embarrassed because I didn't know what to do and couldn't think. I'm a grown woman. I have a German Shepherd in part to keep people away from me. But I felt frozen and just kept walking so my sweet pup didn't react when the man wouldn't leave me alone.

After another two blocks, it occurred to me that I should call the police. I did that and gave the best description I could. But by then he was gone and I said I just wanted them to have the information in case more women report him. I didn't request an officer come out because I thought it had been too long by that time, and what was the point?

I wish I hadn't frozen and could have done something. 

What should I have done?

ETA: THANK YOU to everyone for the support and good advice. I was too shaken to come back to my post to read everyone's responses yesterday, but I've looked through them all this morning and found a great deal of comfort in them, as well as much I want to try to train myself to be ready to implement without having to think it up in the moment (my natural response, as many of you pointed out, seems to some sort of combination of freeze and flee).

 I'm already working with a dog trainer (I want full voice control) and I'm going to ask him to help me train my sweet man to appear more menacing (side note: I still can't believe my German Shepherd wasn't enough of a deterrent in the first place) when I need him to.

Thank you again, everyone. Your kindness, your sharing of your own stories, and your wisdom warm my heart and remind me that good people show themselves when others need help.

ETA2: I may have been deluding myself earlier. I tried to take my dog for a walk and couldn't do it. I felt followed all the time. No street felt safe. I still feel all the gratitude I expressed earlier. I also think I was trying to pretend to myself that I'm fine, not physically hurt, shouldn't be bothered by it anymore.

Casino security just called on my boyfriend because of the way he treats me,"Firstly, I know my relationship is fucked it’s a god damn mess and for some reason I refuse to leave it.

I like bought this trip to Vegas for my partner and sometime when he drinks he gets so nasty out of absolutely bo where. We got back to the room after a lovely day and I asked him what he was doing on his phone. It just hit midnight so I thought he would want to hangout with the dog and I. He said something like leave me the fuck alone. I was sitting there talking with the dog and he just started getting all aggressive and I was like I’m going to take the dog for a walk. He flipped out and was like your not taking my dog anywhere. I said okay I will walk alone. He said get the fuck out of here or something. I got to almost the elevator and I heard someone sprinting full spear behind me. I tried to hide around the corner but he found me and he started yelling at me. Like where’s my fucking key you took my key. I didn’t have his key. I was like I don’t have your fucking key it’s in the room. He was like then take me to the fucking room.

Is my sister's boyfriend being creepy or am I just overreacting?,"  Hello! I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub for advice but I (17f) really need help from my fellow women. 

 5 months ago my sister (26f)  began her first romantic relationship with a coworker (34M). My sister is head over heels in love with him and is intent on marrying him but this man has soooo many red flags.  He repeatedly made misogynistic and weird comments and were unapologetic for any of them. 

Some examples are:

1.He said that women should not get annoyed when they are catcalled because they are being complimented.  

2. He feels that women should dress conservatively and if he sees women wearing things he finds ""trashy"", they are automatically ""hoes"". 

3. When me and my sisters said that we are terrified when we go out because we have to constantly be aware of dangerous men, he laughed and said that he follows lone women around to scare them and when they start walking faster he speeds up. 

4. He believes that boys can sleep around and date when they are young, but girl's can't, because ""boys need to know that they are loved"". 

5. He has stated that he won't date women his age because they are all ""used up hoes"".  (He even said he would date my sister even if she was 20 years old, and that's what he thought her age was when he asked her out.) 

6. He is constantly groping my sister without her consent. 

  This is just the beginning of all of his red flags and toxic qualities, but it would be too long to list all of them. I have communicated to my sister that her boyfriend is full of red flags, but she doesn't care and is intent on marrying him. 

 Now here comes the part where I need to know if I am overreacting or if he's actually a creep. On the third time that he came to our house he was acting weird towards me (or so i think). It was Christmas day and I was the only one he actually bought a well thought out gift for. He didn't get a gift for my other sister and for the sister that he is dating, he allowed her to use his subscription for a podcast (he didn't really know what to get her).The gift for me was expensive for his standards (he is very cheap) and he watched very carefully as I opened it. Afterwards, I playfully poked him on his belly, and when my sisters were upstairs he punched my in my thigh area (near my butt) quite hard.  Later, when my two sisters were making dinner and me and him were alone, he sat down next to me and explained that he specifically got that gift for me because he knows I like pictures and he seemed hurt that I wasn't looking at it. After that, we were all watching a movie and while my two sisters got up to check on the food, he got really close to me and put his arm around my pillow, and I noticed him looking at me. That night my two sisters were talking and I was standing up alone, I turned around and I noticed that he was flustered and staring at me.  When it was time for him to leave, he shook everyone's hand and made a joke, but when it came to shake mine, he looked into my eyes and was staring and breathing sort of heavily. 

The few times after he came over I noticed he would listen carefully to me when I spoke, and he doesn't even do that with my sister. When we all ate dinner together a flower pot was between me and him, and he said that he couldn't see me because of it (we weren't even talking, he just wanted to see me).  He also looked into my eyes and told me how big they were.  I subtly changed the way I walked so it would appear more unattractive and childish, but he noticed that and demonstrated to me exactly how I walked. He began provoking me and when I got upset, he told my sister how badly I was treating him. 

He has previously stated before that he likes small women and said that my sister looks like she is 14. I am smaller than my sister and look very young because I am only 17, and I wonder if he is acting this way around me because he is attracted to very young girls. 

I told my other sister (the one who is NOT dating him) that I was creeped out by his behavior, but she doesn't take it too seriously. He is coming over this weekend and I am very uncomfortable but she said that I could just eat lunch with him and my sister and go upstairs after. 

Am I overreacting? How do I get my sister to see his red flags? Please give me your insight and advice, anything is appreciated :)

I really appreciate your support, but please don't write reviews from my perspective 🙈



Hi everyone,

my post unfortunately got removed from r/solotravel, so I’m trying here instead.

I’m on a solo trip at a 5-star all-inclusive hotel (a gift I was really looking forward to), and something happened that really ruined my sense of relaxation. I’d like some advice on how to handle it.

At one of the hotel restaurants (the ""best one"" with 5 Stars), the man who introduced himself as the owner behaved in ways I found very inappropriate:

He kept commenting on my food like I was a child (“bravo” for finishing my plate, calling me a “good eater”, and even “scolding” me when I left some food). I told him to stop, but he continued.
He also asked me if I was texting my boyfriend and later even how old I was, which felt way too personal and not appropriate coming from someone who is supposed to be working as a manager in a professional setting.

I had strong headaches and told him I was on painkillers and therefore couldn’t drink alcohol. He dismissed it and pressured me into taking a shot anyway, which he also drank himself while on duty. He even said alcohol wouldn’t hurt with medication, which is simply untrue and unsafe.

Later that evening, he wanted to go out for drinks. I said “no” and only after he kept insisting I said maybe the next day. He then asked for my number, saying I could text him if I felt like it – which sounded okay to me at that point. But as soon as I gave it to him, he immediately messaged me asking if I was already sleeping (like 15 minutes after I left the restaurant), what I was doing and if I wanted to meet him for a drink right now after all.
Even when I explained that I wasn’t feeling well and wanted to be alone, he kept pushing and ended his messages with “see you tomorrow” and heart emojis.

He also mentioned he had “seen me” at the other Hotel-Restaurant that morning, which made me feel controlled.
I came here to relax, but now I avoid the hotel bars and restaurants because I don’t feel comfortable. I feel like my all-inclusive package is wasted because of this.

The worst part is how this made me feel as a solo female traveler. I realize I don’t want to go on trips like this alone anymore, because I’m tired of being watched, judged, and treated like I’m fair game just because I’m a woman on my own.
Honestly, I felt much safer and more at ease driving alone through the Czech Republic and even getting lost for hours in the mountains, which was something everyone had warned me would be “too dangerous.” Compared to that, being harassed in a luxury 5-star environment feels so much more violating, because it’s the one place where I should have been able to let my guard down.

My questions:

• Is this kind of behavior common, or is it totally out of line?

• Would you complain formally to the hotel/reception or the tour operator? Should I ask for a refund and send the chat history to the reception?

• Do you think leaving a public review is the best way to warn other solo female travelers?

It felt like repeated boundary-crossing from someone in a position of power. And it sucks that as a woman traveling alone I can’t just enjoy my holiday in peace, especially in a place where I expected luxury and relaxation.

What makes it worse is that he seems to be working in all of the hotel’s bars and restaurants. That means I would run into him everywhere on the property, and since he already mentioned noticing me in other places, I now feel like I’m being watched. Because of that, I honestly don’t know how I’m supposed to spend my last vacation day in a relaxed way.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

Thank you :-)

Edit: It was the Corissia Harmony Boutique Resort in Georgioupolis and the name of the restaurant was 'Ophelia'.

"While leaving a shopping center yesterday, a young woman begged me for help...","I had parked at the very end of the lot, as usual to avoid door dings fender benders. So it caught my attention when someone else had chosen to park adjacent to me. I normally take my time getting in and out of places, so I sat there for a good 30 minutes before heading in to the store. 

While shopping, I notice that a young lady and I kept crossing paths in the aisles. She would make direct eye contact, and I would respond with a smile and continue on my way.

When I was ready to check out, she was right before me in the line, but when another line opened up, I again notice her eyes follow me as I move to the other checkout. 

After paying for my things and go to return the cart, there she is again in front of me. This time she stops me before I get to the door and in a rather soft and nervous voice asks ""Is it alright if I walk out with you please?"".

I instantly knew something was wrong. She seemed scared. I took a quick look out the door and saw a man standing there with another fellow as if he were waiting for someone to exit.

I told her ""Sure. Of course"", asked her where her car was, and put myself between her and the guy waiting outside the door. He was definitely waiting for her, and seemed to mumble sighs of frustration when he saw that someone else was accompanying her and she was not alone.

Turns out this guy had been following her through the shopping center, and the car that had parked next to me at the end lot was her. She was trying to stay near someone she thought would help her, and was gathering the courage to ask for an escort safely back to her vehicle.

When I looked back at the guy she was dodging, he had ran behind the store where the loading docks are, and I made sure he left without following her again.

For fuck sake. When a woman says she's not interested, that means BACK OFF. I felt sorry for her, but glad she was smart enough to push through being timid and actually ask for help.

Edit: As a few others have advised, while this particular incident was not the case, there's apparently a real risk of female decoys used in human trafficking. Luckily it was daylight and there were other people peppered around us in plain view. This girl seemed to have difficulties with being vocal and firm, which may be why he persisted. Best to have staff call for security if you feel the situation poses danger. And thank YOU for being a friend.",TwoXChromosomes,4857,1641420497.0,192,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/rwy3q4/while_leaving_a_shopping_center_yesterday_a_young/
"I reported my rape and this is what happened. Unlike so many, I'M GLAD I DID. Here's what to expect:","This post serves several purposes. First of all, I want to encourage anyone who has been assaulted to report. I initially wasn't, but am so grateful that I did (details below). Secondly, I'd love to get advice on what I'm going through--especially from people who have been through the same thing. Finally, it's therapeutic to just write things out... or so says my therapist. Names and locations have been changed. I broke this into sections because I know it's long.

My name is Annie and I am a 25-year-old girl. I was raped by one of my best friends of three years, Adam, on Cinco de Mayo. I was sober, he was not. I was walking him to his car from a bar, trying to convince him to call an Uber when suddenly I was pulled into his backseat, my dress was flipped up, and he stuck his penis into my vagina, anus, vagina, anus, over and over, regardless of how much I told him to cut it out, how much I squirmed, or how much I pushed him away. 


**The Immediate Aftermath**


The following morning I woke up in a haze. I had grabbed one of my friends (Michael) from the bar who lived nearby and crashed on his couch. The following morning, I woke up to Michael getting ready to go to work. He encouraged me to go get a kit. I paused. My anus was in so much pain... but would getting a kit mean reporting? Did I have it in me to turn over my friend to the police? Kits take hours don't they? And then I remembered: that day, that Wednesday, was the day of my performance review. Instead of getting the information that I desperately wish I had for this case, I went to work. 

Working was miserable. I had only told Michael, who kept asking me what I needed to do. Get up. Get dressed. Drag yourself to work. Fill out paperwork. Write articles and pretend to care about PR campaigns and new clients. At about 3PM, I got a promotion to accompany my performance review. I felt ecstatic for about 15 minutes before my enthusiasm was drowned out by anxiety. What happened to me? I normally love my job. I. couldn't. focus. on. anything. 

Until Mother's Day, that Sunday, I went from crying all the time to feeling numb. I quickly fell behind on my work. I slowly started telling others what happened. I told my best friend, my work best friend, and my boyfriend. In the back of my mind, I was reminding myself that I had been through this before. I was sexually assaulted in college and made the *mistake* of going to campus police. Nothing came of it until two other people came forward about being assaulted, he was expelled, and then was caught molesting a 14-year-old girl. He is in jail now.

As sad as it was, I learned two lessons from that experience. **Tell your parents early. Get therapy early.**

So as I tried to sit through Mother's Day brunch, I watched how happy my family was. I'm aware that telling others is burdensome--it's a reality few are willing to admit. They are going to worry, they are going to feel pain for me. I felt like I was about to rip apart my family. 

Even so, I decided to tell my parents over email the following day after a very important therapy session. **One thing that really helped was that I outlined what I didn't want them to do.**

&gt;Right now, I'm anxious about a number of things. 
&gt;
&gt;1. That you'll think that because I'm out all the time, that it comes as less than a surprise.
&gt;2. That I flirt too much and asked for it.
&gt;3. That you won't believe me.
&gt;4. That you'll push me to prosecute (the truth is that I just want him out of my life, and an entire case sounds like the very worst process to go through). 
&gt;5. That you'll ask me to describe what happened. I am not excited to share--and am having trouble with disassociating.

Both of my parents responded almost immediately. Because I was having trouble eating, my mother offered to come over the following Tuesday--just one week after the incident--and make me food. Luckily, by that point, I started to feel overwhelming rage. I decided to ask her to take me to the police station--just in case I decided to prosecute. Mom was thrilled to accompany me there.


**Going to the police**


We drove together to the county police station at around 7PM. After waiting outside, a female police officer brought us out to a waiting area. She was... she was really the worst. She had me describe the rape in front of my mother, accused me of being drunk (as if that makes a difference?), and, after I told her that I had told Adam to ""cut it out,"" she said that it didn't sound like rape because I didn't outright say ""stop."" 

I don't know in what other world ""cut it out"" means anything but ""stop."" But that's neither here nor there.

She was joined by another officer--a male officer--who was far kinder. He brought me upstairs, closer to the detective who I'd eventually be working with, and pulled me away from others in the waiting area to collect the clothes that I hadn't brought myself to wash, photograph my scraped knees, bruised hip, and chaffed sides from where he had grabbed me, and had me retell him what had happened. He escorted me back to the waiting area where, in front of six other people in the waiting room, the female officer reappeared to chastise me for not reporting earlier. 

Finally, the detective emerged.


**The Detective**


Meeting with Detective Davidson was one of the most important moments in deciding to pursue a case. He took me to the back without my mother, where I wouldn't feel pressured to censor things for her. He started off by easy stuff--what do you do for a living, are you close with your family, etc. And then he had me describe the whole night in full detail. He asked me questions that revealed important things that I wouldn't have thought of--like how did I get out (pulling myself off of him and dumping myself out the side of the car), what time it happened (it must have happened between 9PM and 10PM because the event at the bar had just started), and I showed him texts that Adam had sent me, confessing a sense of guilt and dread and that he had driven home very drunk that night. 

Davidson was really the man who convinced me to go forward with charges. He said that I was in complete control of what happened--if I ever wanted to close the case, that would be my choice. He just wanted to get me to the point where, with evidence, a criminal case could be filed if I wanted to. 

The very first thing that he had me do, after taking my statement and affirming that he thought it was rape as well, he had me get a kit. 


**The Rape Kit**


Google where you can get a Physical Evidence Recovery Kit (PERK) if you need one. In my state, **it's paid for by taxpayers.** They didn't even take my insurance information. 

The hospital near me has an entire department dedicated to PERK. Walking into the center was devastating. There was a young--maybe 16-year-old--girl with cuts all over her right arm and blood coming out of her nose. She was obviously assaulted that same day. She was cowering with her parents and couldn't choke out enough to even give the nurse her address. 

My nurse's name was Claire. She was maybe in her mid-forties, kind, and gentle. She explained to me exactly what would happen. She would once again take pictures of my injuries, test me for STIs with both my urine and blood, and give me a physical exam. 

Little did I know, my anus still had tears from the assault, even a week later. She spread a dye over my anus and vagina that highlighted the tears. As she manipulated my anus, a place that is now so sensitive both physically and emotionally, I started to cry. She waited patiently and spoke soothingly to me. I kept repeating, ""What's more embarrassing than getting raped in the ass?"" This would be the last time I would be capable of crying, even until today. She snapped photos of my genital injuries and let me go. The entire process took less than an hour. From this exam, we were able to learn that there were signs of forced entry and that he had given me chlamydia. 


**The Phone Sting**


The detective continued to work closely with me. I was able to identify Adam's address, turned over my credit card statement to prove I hadn't drank much that night, and felt *better* as time went on. The case gave me focus--I still tell myself, ""You, Adam, messed with the wrong bitch."" 

In our state, we're able to call someone and record them without them knowing. The sting kit is a machine that hooks into my phone and records a phone conversation.  After not talking to him for almost two weeks at this point, I was able to get him to talk to me for about ten minutes with the hook, 
""Hey, you have chlamydia.""

Unfortunately, because this case hasn't gone to trial yet, I can't be any more specific than that on the sting, What I will say though is that Detective Davidson sat with me through it and wrote things down for me to say to Adam to try to get information out of him. We got a lot of what we wanted, but not everything. 


**What's next?**


My state is either going to bring him in for questioning or arrest him (without bail). I don't know the details, but my bet is that it will either be this week or next. This has all transpired over the course of less than a month. 

I wish that I could say I'm doing super well. The case, emotionally, has honestly been one of the best things for me. Instead of allowing my mind to wander about ""what ifs"" or stewing on the violence of the crime, I feel like this is something I can be proactive about. My negative energy is serving a purpose. 

With that said, I've had some really bad days. I'm still looking for a trauma specialist--everyone seems booked!--and art therapy is working just o.k. for me. I'm incapable of crying and I feel overwhelming rage all the time--sometimes to the point of hurting myself (no worries folks, I haven't actually injured myself). 

If anyone else has gone through this, I'd love it if you reached out to me. If you are going through this, going to the police *can be a positive experience.* Rape is a horrific crime--it's a tragedy that so few report. Hopefully this may serve as a guide to help you make the best choice for yourself in terms of reporting. 

**Edit**: Wow, this post really exploded. First of all, it breaks my heart to hear all the stories about rape left in the comments. I really feel for all of you... please, if it happened recently, consider getting a kit. You're not required to report, but, at least in my state, your medical care will be covered. For example, the state is paying for my chlamydia medication.

Secondly, I've been teary from all the heartwarming messages that you've sent me. I was able to be connected to someone who showed me how to get in touch with a local crisis center for therapy, and I've been talking to others that have been in the same emotional place that I'm in now. It makes me feel so much less alone. 

Finally, after the case concludes, I promise to follow up.

Thank you, stranger, for the gold. Never thought I'd make it to the front page with this story.

Am I wrong for wanting to spend time together?,"I brought my boyfriend to my house for the weekend since my parents aren’t home and he brought his video game. We never get alone time since we both still live with our parents, so i figured this would be a nice weekend. 

Well it’s not. He’s up till 3 am talking to his boys on his game, I wake up and he’s talking to the boys on his game. I don’t have a problem if he games, but this was supposed to be our time and it just hurts my feelings that I’m not getting any of his attention. I even called out of work yesterday for him to come. Last night at 2 am i asked if he was going to come to bed and he made a big thing out of it saying i make everything about me. He walks away calling me a “toxic ass bitch” gets further through the house and mumbles “stupid ass cunt” then proceeded to get back on his game. I just layed in bed and cried. He comes in the bed 30 min later and tried to touch me and I’m like did you forget what you just called me? This isn’t the first time he’s called me out of my name, and definitely won’t be the last. I just don’t understand how you can tell someone you love them and treat them like literal scum. I just woke up now and he’s still on the game. I know we need to break up, i Feel like it’s going to happen when i take him home. I just needed to rant a bit cause he makes me feel like I’m the bad guy and i know I’m not the bad guy for wanting to spend quality time.


EDIT: 
I did it!!! 
I know I shouldn’t have, but I took him home. The car ride was silent. He tried to make small talk like nothing was going on, but I just ignored it. Can’t remember how it started, but when i was dropping him off he was bitching me out about something so i just drove off with the door still opened and closed it halfway down the street… but yea i just texted him saying i can’t do this anymore and legit he’s just sending “ :( “ and then he said “but i love you to death and we can just start over “ it’s just pathetic honestly I’m glad I’m out. 

I also wanted to thank everyone of you for taking the time to help me out through this :) I’ve read all the comments at least twice now it’s just hard to respond to all. I appreciate the kind (and some not kind) words i needed to hear.

Sarah Everard and #notallmenbutallwomen," 

If you haven't heard, recently a woman was murdered in the UK, allegedly by an off-duty police officer. (Who was also being investigated for indecent exposure and has now been charged on suspicion of murder and indecent exposure)

This happened after she went missing after walking home from a friends house.

She was walking home.

On Twitter there was an outpouring of personal stories and outrage from women and some men that this is still an issue for women and that the onus is on women to protect themselves from women.

Some of those ""precautions"" being:

* Don't go out at night
* Don't wear revealing clothes
* Don't wear heels
* Wear headphones, but don't have music on
* Keep your keys close as a possible weapon

Clearly those aren't working. Women are punished and blamed for ""enticing"" unwanted male attention and I wasn't surprised at some of stories being shared on social media.

[UN Women UK](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/almost-all-young-women-in-the-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-survey-finds) found that 97% of women aged 18 to 24 in this country had been sexually harassed, while 80% of women of all ages said they had been sexually harassed in public spaces.

Sarah Everard was walking home. She was wearing leggings. It may have been dark, but why should we, as women, fear something so mundane.

We then saw the sad predictability of #notallmen trending. Men who had too much ego to realize no one is attacking them specifically, crying that people are being mean to men. Gaslighting, anger and *shifting of the blame onto women again.* Women know it's not all men, but it's enough men to not be able to know who to trust.

Then a new hashtag cropped up. #notallmenbutallwomen. There was another outpouring of women's stories and men listening to those stories and posting their reflections. Maybe it's just enough to get a conversation moving. We've had communication and understanding but there are still those who don't believe its an issue because they cannot see past their nose.

For me personally, here are a few of my experiences.

1. I was 11 - I'd just started senior school and the older grades would slap the arses of the year seven girls cause it was ""funny"" to them. Me included.
2. I was 15 - I was walking home from the cinema and a man followed me home after catcalling me from his car. I had to call my dad to meet me half way. I was wearing a winter coat and jeans.
3. I was 18 - I was waiting for the last bus home. I was sitting at the bus stop. In my uniform and coat smelling like B.O and BBQ sauce. Another guy was standing at the bus top, got closer to me over time and then whipped out his dick while I was looking at my phone.

I'm so tired.

EDIT: since it seems some trolls are finding this post here's some extra facts for you.

Estimates published by WHO indicate that globally about 1 in 3 (30%) of women worldwide have been subjected to either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.

Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost one third (27%) of women aged 15-49 years who have been in a relationship report that they have been subjected to some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner.

On average, there are 433,648 victims (age 12 or older) of rape and sexual assault each year in the United States.

82% of all juvenile victims are female. 90% of adult rape victims are female. Females ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault.

About 3% of American men—or 1 in 33—have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime.

The CSEW (Crime Survey for England and Wales) estimated that approximately 700,000 people aged 16 to 59 years were victims of a sexual assault in the last year. The majority of these cases will not enter the criminal justice system. Less than one in five victims of rape or assault by penetration reported their experience to the police.

The majority of victims were female, with approximately 560,000 female victims and 140,000 male victims. Women were nearly four times as likely as men to have experienced sexual assault in the last year

EDIT: More statistics more looking at Murder.

The Office of National Statistics found that men were twice as likely to be murdered than women. However women were three times as likely to be killed by someone they know. Someone they trust. The nature and motive of murder differs wildly depending on the victim. (Further edit to clarify - 

Within this report it is worth noting that there were only 698 murders/manslaughters in the UK last year comparative to 153,136 sexual assaults **reported** to the police. 

If we go by the stat that means 460 men did sadly lose their lives last year to violent crime.

Also going by the maths - 122,508 women were sexually assaulted (560,000 is 80% of estimate from the CSEW of reported/non-reported crimes)

**Meaning women are 266x more likely to be sexually assaulted than a man being murdered.**

"""And this is part of my training,"" he said, as he grabbed my ass.","I woke up later than usual this morning, after a late flight home last night. My fiancé was home getting ready for a long day and I went out to take the dog on our morning walk together, like we do every morning. I missed our morning walks while I was away and was happy to be home with my family. We're moving in two weeks and I was taking my time to enjoy the walk, groggily thinking about the neighborhood that I had grown to love over the years, as well as my general excitement about the future. In the upcoming months we're moving back to our hometown, my fiancé is getting his PhD, we're starting new jobs, and getting married. We're on the cusp of our next chapter and I wanted to take a moment to remember the last one.

On the last leg of our walk, I saw who I thought was a neighbor cross the street ahead of us and head down the block to a main strip nearby. Halfway down the next block towards my house, he was surprisingly behind us and gaining. I simply thought the neighbor forgot something and was heading back home. I don't know him well enough to turn around and engage him in conversation and when I glanced back he was on his phone. I heard him say something to the extent of, ""Okay, I'll be over soon.""

There was a party on the sidewalk last night for the opening of a little boutique, so scraps of food were everywhere. The dog was trying to grub and he took this opportunity to try to engage us. I quickly realized as I got a closer look at his face that he was in fact, not the neighbor I thought he was. I brushed off his attempt at conversation, feeling too tired to engage strangers on the street and figuring he'd get the point. He tried to keep pace with me so I made a point of stopping in front of the barbershop on the corner near my apartment. I smiled and waved to the barbers inside. I hoped the dude would get the point that this is my neighborhood and I know all the regulars around here. He didn't.

We kept moving and the dog stopped to grub again, and he stopped to pet her. I asked him not to, explaining that I'm trying to train her to not do this and rewarding the behavior isn't going to help. I gave her a gentle tug to keep moving, and he grabbed her bandana. I told him to let go of her, which he did. It was creepy but I made it to the door of the building, knowing that I could get inside the courtyard quickly and shut it behind me, instantly locking the creep out. I didn't expect what happened next. He said, ""And this is part of my training,"" and grabbed my ass as I turned to the door.

I saw red. I turned around, looked him in the eye, and pointed at him. I opened my mouth not truly knowing what I would say. I yelled, ""Fuck you! Fuck you! I'm going to kill you! Fuck you!"" He ran, I ran, but the dog froze. She was clearly afraid of my anger but soon started to run with me. I continued yelling as he turned the corner by the barbershop. I stopped in front and shouted, ""That guy fucking grabbed my ass!"" and they all ran out behind him. Motherfucker was quick. We lost him.

The owner of the shop apologized several times and I apologized to him for making a scene in front of their customers. He didn't care; he had just told me and the fiancé last week that he was going to miss us when we move because we were his favorite couple to see walking around the neighborhood. He put his hand on my shoulder and apologized again, then said that he never thought he'd see that side of me. I told him I didn't expect him to see it either. His daughter is close to my age and I knew he was probably thinking about her in that moment. One of the other barbers was walking around, pacing, angrily saying it was so fucked up. I probably mumbled some more stuff about being angry and in disbelief that it happened, apologized for disrupting their business, and then headed home. They weren't going to leave me on the street so they waited until I got back to my building before heading back into the shop.

I got home and told my fiancé what happened. He was obviously pissed, but he wrapped me in his arms and told me we needed to call the police. He said he heard screaming outside before I got home but didn't think it could possibly be me. His gut was to go outside and try to find this guy, but I told him he was long gone. I made the call, crying with rage, and then we headed downstairs to meet the police officer. They sent a female cop, which I instantly appreciated. While we spoke, she noted the camera behind me facing the door to the building. I had completely forgotten it was there, but she was right - it was brand new and everything must have been caught on camera. She took the property manager's name and number and said they would reach out to him for the video. The last forcible touching case she had that was caught on video allowed them to put out a warrant for the guy's arrest. She also said that since I knew the direction he was heading towards, her partner was already driving around the neighborhood looking for him.

At this point, I was starting to lose the composure I tried to maintain while talking to her. Tears welled up in my eyes as I explained to her that I was a teacher at an elementary school three blocks away. This was my neighborhood, my community, and I walked everywhere. This was unacceptable. I tried not to turn into a blubbering idiot while I explained that I worked at an all girls school and I fear for my students' safety walking around the neighborhood, given the recent increase in violence our city has been seeing. And now this. It was 10AM. If someone thinks they can get away with this in the middle of a Saturday morning, what are they willing to do under the cover of darkness? She agreed, and empathetically listened. It was what I needed in that moment.

We've contacted the property manager, who is pretty illiterate with technology but he tried to watch the videos anyways. He said the guy who knows how to operate the system will be back tomorrow and that they would make sure to go through it. I'm relieved to know that the cameras weren't fake and hopeful that the incident was caught on tape so that this guy can get picked up.

I often read posts on here. My heart breaks every time I read your accounts of sexual assault. I know my story was a minor one and that things could have been much, much worse. I can't claim to fully understand the pain of those who have experienced much more violent assaults, but please keep sharing them with us and others.

His words - ""And this is part of my training,"" were his attempt at a snide remark. He didn't realize how revealing those words were. We aren't doing enough to train our young boys that this type of behavior is not okay. Keep sharing your stories, keep spreading love and acceptance. We are a formidable force when we work together and I believe that we can empower future generations through the sharing of our experiences and emotions.

TL;DR: A dude grabbed my ass in the middle of the morning while I was walking my dog, saying it was part of ""his training"". I'm livid, and sharing my story.

"I was chased by a guy at night in the park, and I'm very frustrated by the reactions of friends.","Last night after hanging out with friends I (23F) had to walk home alone for about 20 minutes. A part of the walking route goes through a park with no light so it's always a bit scary. But last night I noticed a guy walking after me, he started to move closer to me. When I started walking faster, he walked faster as well. He started to come really close and when he was close enough I heard him sort off moaning to him self and saying ""I'm sorry baby. I'm sorry baby"" over and over. I was so freaked out, it was dark, no one was around, so I started running. He screamed some shit after me saying he wasn't going to hurt me. I ran untill I made it home.

When I was home I told some friends about what happened. I had some friends who were really worried but some of my friends just made some joke about it while others told me I was dumb for walking around there alone at night. I'm just frustrated that some friend didn't take it seriously at all and others laid the fault by me. I'm totally fine now, but just wanted to share my frustrations of not being taken seriously.  


EDIT: 

Hi everyone! I just wanted to do an edit because I just couldn't bring myself to answer to everyone, however I've read every comment and I want to say thank you! Thank you to everyone who shaired their support, you guys littarely brought tears to my eyes for being so nice! To everyone sharing their story about something similar, I'm sorry that happened to you and I hope you're staying safe!  

To answer some questions:   
\- To people saying I should get a gun, I don't live in a country where this is legal so this is not possible haha. However I did like the suggestions of buying pepperspray or getting self defense lessons, I will look into this!  
\- To people saying I should not have walked there at night. I already took the train home, but from the trainstation it's a 20 min walk to my home. We don't have Ubers here and I already took the longer route that goes somewhat around the park and not through it. I get where you are coming from but there were not a lot of other options for me.  
\- Some people told me to go to the police to file a report on this guy. I'm thinking about doing that.

Im happy about the discussion that has been sparked by this story. Reading about all your similar, or worse, stories made me sad but I'm happy people are speaking up about it.

"For the first time yesterday, a man backed off after I told him my age. I'm unsure how to feel and just want a men free place to rant.","Yesterday I was waiting for the train at night, and this man kept smiling at me.  I smiled back to be polite, I didn't want to seem rude or anything, and he headed over and told me his name, and asked where I was going. I was a bit uncomfortable, but in case he was just friendly I didn't want to offend him by assuming he was flirting, y'know? So I told him I was heading towards Brooklyn, and he asked if we could keep in touch. I told him I was sorry, but I was actually thirteen.

And here's the thing . . . he left? He apologized, told me I looked older, smiled, and . . . walked away? I get asked out by older men *all* the time (I look a lot older than 13), and this was the FIRST TIME someone had backed down. Usually they'll assume I'm lying, or just not care and keep flirting, or worst case, tell me I shouldn't dress like an adult because it's leading men on. But he was respectful and walked away. And I wanted to run over and actually thank him, because it felt so nice! I felt valued and respected as a person! And I wanted to just chase after him and tell him how much that meant to me.

And then I realized that leaving a literal middle-schooler alone after learning her age is the BASIS OF HUMAN DECENCY. How is that seen as respectable and laudable? How is walking away after learning you're hitting on a child seen as something you should aspire to do, instead of what's expected? How have I gotten to the point where I want to thank someone for not harassing me?

I'm so tired of this. Not to be cliché, but I fucking hate men right now.

**EDIT:** I've received a lot of angry dm's from men about my ""I fucking hate men right now"" comment. I'm sorry if it offended you, of course I don't hate ALL men, I was just frustrated and ended up typing that out.

I (28F) was at a party where a man (40s?) was relentlessly harassing women. Was I wrong for staring him down and protecting another woman?,"Hey everyone. My boyfriend disagrees with my assessment of a situation that happened yesterday, so I'm here for some clarity.
TL;DR Drunk creepy guy harassed women at a party, I stared him down and protected a woman getting harassed by him, and ended up taking the heat for it from him and my boyfriend.

Last night I was at an event where 50 or so people were camping together. I was with my boyfriend and 4 acquaintances. When we arrived this guy approached our group, Jack Daniel's in hand. He was speaking nonsense, I literally cannot recall what he even said it was such gibberish and he had a very thick accent. I instantly got an awful vibe from him - he started invading my personal space, getting offended when I moved farther away, trying to get a rise out of me and the other women in our group. They mostly just ignored him and even humored him occasionally. I didn't say anything to him except warning him not to touch me or approach me too closely which he repeatedly attempted to do.

He later stopped by our encampment saying nonsense about setting our camper on fire, murdering people, honestly I couldn't understand much else of what he said due to his drunkenness and thick accent. I felt super uncomfortable and just stared at him/ignored him when he attempted to engage, generally by trying to intimidate me (focusing solely on me, commenting on my demeanor, puffing out his chest and trying to make me flinch). Nobody said a word about this, just generally saying he was being creepy. Someone told me he was the best friend of one of the organizers and he was going through a divorce, Yada Yada. Everybody was taking pity on him. 

Whenever I would see him at the party he would deliberately go out of his way to antagonize me, saying things like 'oh, she hates me' and making rude comments. At one point there was a crowd listening to the live music and one girl was dancing (hooping, for those in the flow community). He kept 'corralling' her, harassing her, getting so close her hoop kept hitting him, and attempting to 'dance with her'. This went on for several minutes, and nobody around us was doing anything at all about it. I went up to her and asked, 'is he bothering you?' she replied 'only as much as he's bothering everyone else too'. I turned to him and blocked him from getting close to her again and told him he was too close. He puffed out his chest and started talking gibberish again, and didn't back off, so I said it again, louder, and he finally walked a short distance away. Then he kept approaching me, which felt really aggressive. I finally just walked away.

Every time he saw me that night he would make a big deal about it, arguing with me (I honestly have no idea what he was even saying, he was so wasted and it was a loud event). Saying 'hey, just one thing, hey listen, hey'. My boyfriend eventually started telling him to back off, but by then it was pointless. EDIT: my boyfriend corrected me, he actually did defend me after I stood up for hoop girl. I was wrong about this. 

Today I lamented to my boyfriend how sad it was that nobody spoke up about him and talked to the organizers about how uncomfortable and harassed they felt, even though several people talked about it with me and my group. My boyfriend told me that I should not have engaged. I should have just completely ignored him like everybody else did. I told him how scared I would have felt if it had been me dancing because nobody would have spoken up or helped me. He said there's nothing you can do in that situation, nobody would have removed him (it was a private event at a campground you must pay to access). Basically that it was a waste of time and I made it worse on myself.

Maybe he's right. I honestly don't know. I felt like I helped that girl, and I didn't let him walk all over me like the other women. She didn't talk to me about it later or thank me or anything, which gave me pause. What are your thoughts?

Edit: my boyfriend actually corrected me, he did stand up for me after the guy kept harassing me after I stood up for hoop girl. I totally forgot about that. I thought I remembered things a certain way but my judgment was clouded and I forgot that things happened differently. Please stop blaming my boyfriend for this, he didn't do anything wrong and I've misinterpreted this situation.",TwoXChromosomes,2249,1645463717.0,291,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/sxyshg/i_28f_was_at_a_party_where_a_man_40s_was/
"I scared a guy so badly after he groped me in a public park, and he crapped in his pants.","I was walking out of the AMC Loews theater on Boston Common at about 9pm on a Friday night.  I live in Cambridge, and the other movie-goers I was with were going in the other direction, leaving me on my own. The entrance to the Red Line T stop (subway) is across the street and down the block from the theater, so I was only outside for about two minutes before this happened, still well within view of dozens of people.


A man that looked to be at least fifteen years older than myself who was walking near me in the same direction took an extra step to catch up to me and put his arm around my shoulder and grabbed my breast, and said ""Hey"".


I'm small.  I'm blonde. I wear t-shirts, jeans and old sneakers.  I practice monstrous voices as a hobby.  One of these things came out to my advantage.


I pushed him off me, and in my most threatening bellow yelled, **""HOW DARE YOU TOUCH ME?""**  Please see the Vocaroo link for a low-quality replicated voice clip that I only wish could be as good as my fear-inspired ourburst: [Link to Clip](http://vocaroo.com/i/s0LO2ZylAaYG)


The guy froze, his mouth open and face in total shock.  I knew I caught him by surprise.  It took me a few seconds, between him standing funny and the smell to realize that he crapped in his pants.  


I looked around, and saw a few other people staring, probably because I had just yelled at someone in a park, and made an awkward walk away from the guy.  I was shaken from being grabbed, and got to the Park Street station as fast as I could walk.  


This was not the first time I was groped, and it will likely not be the last.  I can only hope that this one man will have felt some sort of primal fear, and will never touch a person without their permission again.

Also, if anyone cares, I was coming out of seeing Muppets: Most Wanted.  I fucking love the Muppets.

Some stranger tried OPENING THE DOOR TO MY CAR WHILE the engine was on and I (27F) WAS sitting IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,"I think I'm still in shock, with a bit of fear, and adrenaline...

I started door-dashing recently part-time after becoming burnt out from my previous job. So far, I like it! The work can be tiring (work is work) but the flexible schedule, the alone time, and the constant moving has a positive effect on my mental health.

Safety has always been a concern of mine. I take precautions such as sharing my location with a family member, locking my car doors IMMEDIATELY after entering or exiting my car, and avoiding late-night door dashing (8 pm - 12 am). Unfortunately, the area I'm in has the best peak pay at later hours, and  I've door-dashed late the last couple of times (I got bills to pay 😭) with no issues and no feeling unsafe.

Except, for one instant which I chalked up to being a one-off thing. Maybe, I should have stuck to my guns and never dashed late again to avoid what happened recently. 

It was about 9 pm and I stopped at a well-lit gas station for snacks and a bathroom break. When I returned to my car I locked the doors, munched on some snacks for \~5-10 min, and waited for some door dash offers to appear. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed someone walking close to my car and paused for a second or two. I was parked maybe 2 spots away from the gas station's entrance so I figured they were passing by and didn't pay them any more attention. That's when I heard it. ""KA CHINK"". The sound of someone trying to open the locked door to MY car while the engine is running with a seemingly unaware driver.

I looked at him bewilderedly (he looked to be in his 40's). ""I wasn't trying to scare you. I was looking for a ride (???)"", he uttered. This guy may not have known that I noticed him walking into the gas station with someone else. And I look nothing like his ""friend"". Also, if he thought I was an Uber or Lyft, WHY WOULD HE TRY TO OPEN THE PASSENGER DOOR??? (Their policy requires passengers to sit in the back). I gave him an awkward smile, put my car in reverse, and drove away. I feel like my space was violated. What would compel him to open the door to a stranger's car while they're inside?

Thank the Lord nothing worse happened. ""I wasn't trying to scare you"", he says. So WHAT were you trying to do then? Cause the math isn't adding up 😨😬😩

If anyone here has advice for additional safety measures or self-defense tools I can have on hand at any moment's notice, please feel free to share.",TwoXChromosomes,1358,1710321014.0,217,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bdmy8s/some_stranger_tried_opening_the_door_to_my_car/
"Man I went on one date with is mentally unstable, repeatedly harassing me, and is actively about to be employed as a police officer. Do I say something to them? ","This is a bit long but please read it all before commenting so that you get the whole picture. So I went on ONE date a month ago with a man, got such immensely bad vibes putting my entire body in fight or flight mode that I actually faked feeling sick to go home. I have never done this or had that feeling before. This person essentially would not allow me to Uber home, cornering me by his car, and insisted he take me home. At the time I panicked and just said fine because I felt my options were pretty much either refuse and he gets even more angry and possibly violent, or let him take me home and hope he is not going to do anything. I'm aware this was dumb, but at this point I was extremely scared and did not react properly because of that. 


Texted him the next day (after he called me multiple times that night after getting home) that I was not interested in anything further and didn't feel we were compatible, but thanked him for getting me home. He initially seemed to accept it after begging for a second date first, but has sense started harassing me regularly. Texting me at extremely weird times trying to start conversations as if nothing had happened, and like we've known each other for years. He once called me at 6am and after telling him it was extremely odd to call someone at 6am who doesn't want to talk to you he said ""okay I'll only call in the afternoon"" as if the time was the problem here and not the fact that he is contacting me at all. Since that incident I have stopped replying entirely. I haven't blocked since he knows my address and I feel it's even less safe to block and not see a message from him saying he is coming over or something like that. 


Got another message this morning saying it wasn't fair I didn't want to go out with him and I finally lost it. I told home that I've said at least 5 times now to leave me alone yet you don't stop. To which he thanked me for noticing his persistence and then ""Merry Christmas you beautiful menace"" (wtf??). It's clear that he is not even entertaining the idea that I don't want him, and is going to continue no matter what I say. I finally told him if he didn't stop I would be alerting the police station he is currently on the eligibility list for to become an officer next year, because this was not acceptable behavior. He then told me that I needed to leave HIM alone, and he was going to block ME and ""threatening people isn't cool"" and that I needed to seek mental help not him (lol). 


I don't think someone who clearly cannot handle rejection or accept when a woman is not interested should be considered for a role as a police officer in any capacity. He made many concerning statements about his mental health on our date, is currently a security guard now and felt the need to mention, unprovoked, multiple times that he had a gun but not to worry I'm safe because they background check him alot. I want to alert the department he's applying at about his behavior, but the fact that he knows where I live after being forced to be taken home I don't want to then deal with jeopardizing my safety if he retaliates were they to do something with his eligibility. 


What do I do? This man absolutely SHOULD NOT be a police officer. ",TwoXChromosomes,1252,1735063494.0,138,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hlizrd/man_i_went_on_one_date_with_is_mentally_unstable/
Men often DO pick up on predatory behavior without necessarily recognizing it for what it is,"I've been testing the theory that most men know exactly which guys are creeps without fully realizing it. They'll openly admit it, as long as you don't put it in those terms.  

If you ask the guys you know, ""do you know any men that might sexually harass, pressure, or take advantage of a woman?"" it's all *no way! I'd NEVER associate with a guy like that!*    

But they're thinking of the Boogeyman Waiting to Jump Out of the Bushes type, not the acquaintance/friend creep that is responsible for the majority of assaults.    

But if you ask: ""Guys know which guy is killing the vibe, right? The one who has no game with girls, is always a little too pushy and isn't picking up on their disinterest? You know, gets a little too ""enthusiastic"" and chases the girls off? The one everybody tries to keep from saying or doing something stupid?""    
I've asked a few men this, and they've all immediately said yes with no hesitation.  

They sometimes even tell a story of some guy that always ruins nights out by doing some weird shit. &amp;#10;  
A few of the more aware ones admitted that there'd been times they'd noticed a guy's inappropriate behavior on a night out and attempted to run interference in a nonconfrontational way. Usually, it was an acquaintance or friend of a friend that they didn't feel comfortable calling out directly.  

The problem is that most of them are telling these stories in exasperation. Framing it as these men as ""having no game,"" as *cockblocking* the rest of them, as them being an awkward idiot that's a bit too intense, as causing mild inconvenience, but **not** as being a creep who either ignores or doesn't recognize boundaries.   

But *women know.* The guy who is too aggressive, overly familiar, whose idea of flirting is to make demeaning or odd sexual references, who follows you around the bar/party. Who tries to touch you. &amp;#10;  
The guy who is either pushy and demanding or radiates a frightening sort of desperation. Who won't keep things casual, won't give up trying to hit on you. The guy who is pushing you to drink.  &amp;#10;  
The one who repeatedly doesn't pick up on/ignores your discomfort, nervousness, and polite deferrals until you're signaling to your friends for the whole group to leave. &amp;#10;  
**The one you'd be afraid to end up alone with.**  

The moment I explain that the thing they're viewing as ineptitude can be what women are interpreting as *scary,* some of them have an ""oh!"" moment, some of them are defensive.   

But **all** of them did have experiences with friends or acquaintances who they remembered as constantly chasing women off. &amp;#10;  
They're often just failing to recognize that what's ""killing the mood"" is the alarm bells going off for the women he encounters and that it's potentially more than just being awkward or inexperienced. &amp;#10;  
They know who would be *their* last choice to escort an intoxicated female relative home, even if they've never consciously thought about it.  

This **not** to say that being bad at flirting is somehow predatory. Being nervous or a bit awkward isn't the same as making someone feel pressured and unsafe. There's a massive difference between feeling uninterested and mildly annoyed vs feeling cornered and nervous about your safety.  &amp;#10;  
But the men that *are* potentially dangerous often have friends, have social groups, have people who may have picked up on their behaviors. &amp;#10;  
They hear his ""jokes,"" see his anger and entitlement towards women, see him push the line. They just dismiss it as awkwardness, cockiness, or ""locker room talk."" &amp;#10;  
They're not seeing it for what it is or recognizing the seriousness of it.",TwoXChromosomes,2584,1680462294.0,154,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/129uoe5/men_often_do_pick_up_on_predatory_behavior/
DAILY REMINDER - When Men Tell You Who They Are - BELIEVE THEM,"So it's taken me years to do this but girls, ladies, enbys, when a man tells you who he is, BELIEVE THEM. 


If a man says he's the ""ruin your life type"", do a 180 and walk away. 


If a man tells you he is/was a fuck boy and you're not into that, repeat step above. 


If a man tells you he's flakey and that's gonna irk you? Repeat said step.

I think this is the first time I've followed this rule without hesitation or wavering and I'm so proud of myself for it. It's taken me countless stories and comments on here to get it into my thick skull.

Some men have no idea how women actually live and it shows.,"Firstly, let me just say that I 100% understand that men have struggles too- many men don't get help for mental health, and are often not taken seriously when they are victims of abuse, for example. These are important issues that deserve to be taken seriously.

But oh my god, some of the things some of them always claim is ""horrible"" about being a man are just so detached from reality or self-centered. I recently read a thread where men were asked what was the worst about being a man. And I kid you not, here are some of the replies:

* ""It's hard to date as a man"" A lot of women get rejected as well. Not all women are sexy bombshells that have men lined up to sleep with them, a misunderstanding about how women live.
* ""We have to provide for the family"" ??? 99% of women work in my country  and earn their own goddamn money (which they had to fight to able to do) but sure
* ""Loneliness"" as if women never experience loneliness? Edit: I realized that I sound like a shitty person here. Sorry about that. Loneliness is valid in all genders and should not be belittled by anyone. Sorry.
* &amp;#x200B;
* ""Women don't want men with a low status."" Personally, I just want a respectful man who takes care of himself and acts like an adult and has a job. No crazy demands here. Am I supposed to lower my standards to date someone out of charity? Also, I'm pretty sure plenty of men also want women with status.
* &amp;#x200B;

And the worst ones:

* ""Women get scared of us when we walk behind them at night""
* ""Women are scared of us/judge us as if we're all bad""

Poor you. You have it worse than that woman who is literally fearing for her safety, knowing she will never be able to outrun or fight off a man. How are we supposed to know which men are bad and which ones are not? Do these men think that we can just automatically tell which men are gonna hurt us our not, like an inner radar? Of course we are scared, we have no idea who to trust in a world where 50% of the population are stronger than us! I'm gonna look over my shoulder and speed home when walking home alone at night. We don't exist to make men feel comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Women can have an abortion even if the man doesn't agree"" Because it's her body, not yours.
* ""(cis) Men can't have children without a (cis) woman"" That's just biology.

What kind of warped view do these men have of women's lives? That we are all happily jumping around in bed with our 1000 friends, we never feel lonely, that we wake up with makeup and our hair done and have a harem of men lined up to please us endlessly?

The problem here is some men have no idea how women actually live and what our lives are like. They think our lives are like a typical romcom or a music video, and that feminism solved all issues. That being a woman is a dance on roses because we escaped the kitchen and are allowed to go to school, work and vote (the bare minimum).  They need to wake up.

(of course I am very grateful for my rights, I am aware I come from a privileged part of the world,  but there is still much work to do)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should have explained some of my arguments better, but regards to the dating thing: my point was that a lot of men don't realise how much effort women put into dating. Makeup, hair, clothes, shaving every part of the body. My point was a lot of women put a lot of effort into dating and also get positive results from that

&amp;#x200B;

Edit again: After thinking a great deal I have realized that some of the things that men go through, I actually haven't looked enough into. I've been very dismissive and frustrated because of my own struggles, instead of actually listening and understanding the struggles of men. I think I need to do some work on myself.",TwoXChromosomes,1715,1654024203.0,324,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v1xoly/some_men_have_no_idea_how_women_actually_live_and/
My dad told me that women made up #metoo,"I'm visiting home for the holidays, and it's been about five years since I've made it back here (I live across the country and life happens.) 

It's been a great visit so far and I know to avoid politics, but somehow #metoo came up and my dad got visibly angry. He told me that he knows some sexual assault happens, but that the vast majority of women make it up for attention or to ruin men's lives. 

I told him about times I was sexually harassed at work (various examples from various workplaces) and one time that I was groped on a bus. I told him about the various times I was followed by men when leaving transit, walking to bars/ restaurants/ etc. This was an incredibly awkward and emotional conversation to have with him. 

He very angrily responded that MAYBE I've had these experiences, but most women are lying or they would have said something earlier, and that by calling various things rape 'hardcore rapes' won't be taken as seriously. He told me about how hard it is to be a man in today's society. 

I'm shocked and don't know how to respond. I don't think I'll be able to change his mind, but it's horrifying to me that he honestly feels that way.

I remember being 13 and motioned to by a car of older men with my friend when we were walking at night.... just two kids being kids. I remember being 14, and those same men leered at me, catcalled me, motioned towards me again, and then did a u-turn to follow me and I ran home crying. I remember being dresscoded by a man at this very school.


The same men that followed me still make me peek over my shoulder even now. I'm 18 now. I didn't wanna leave the house when I was 14 all summer, it took me so much courage to walk to the store in a skirt.


Wanna know who reinforced the idea that my body is the problem?

You did.

And it is so insane to me how a curvaceous, grown woman could inflict the same incident that she probably experienced growing up.

Not only did you dresscode me, but you even remarked that I should ""get a better fitting skirt."" Completely unsolicited. How quaint.


Wanna know a fun little fact?


I don't have clean pants today for school. I was going to wear a skirt instead, but I decided to spray perfume on my 6 day old pants to wear again because the thought of you calling me over made my stomach churn and I'd rather keep my breakfast down.

"My new ""bf"" is creeping me out","My mom is making me start hanging out with this guy because she thinks it'll make me stop liking girls. She says I don't have to do anything with him until I'm 18. Which would be a relief if my 18th birthday weren't in 2 weeks. I met him a few weeks back at a family party. Things got off to a bad start when he walked in on me in the bathroom. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that it was an accident. He just kinda made me uncomfortable the whole night. I can't point to an exact reason but I guess it was just a sense or something. 

I didn't hear from him for awhile but then he randomly showed up at my cheer practice last Thursday. I never told him I was in cheer so I have no idea how he found out. Well my mom probably told him. I really didn't like him being there. Cheer uniforms are pretty immodest and he's the last person I want seeing me dressed like that. Things got even weirder on Friday.

Me and the other girls from cheer went to a party Friday night. My mom would never let me go so I lied and said that I was hanging out at my friends house. Well the party had alcohol and I drank some just to fit in ya know. Well the alcohol was mixed with juice and it tasted really good. I didn't even taste the alcohol so I assumed there must not be much in it. I obviously over did it because I don't remember anything past like 10pm. I remember being at the party and then waking up in my bed. Later on Saturday my mom confronted me about the party and said she knew everything because my ""BF"" had brought me home.

Besides the embarrassment and punishment my mom handed down, I was freaked out that he had done that. My friend confirmed he took me home too. I don't even know how we knew I was there. My mom didn't know about the party and I obviously didn't tell my ""bf"". It's all just super creepy and I get sick thinking of myself unconscious in a car alone with him. I noticed some UTI like symptoms starting yesterday so now I'm scared that maybe he did something to me while I was asleep or too drunk to care. Ugh thanks for reading this overly long rant.

Edit: Some people are saying I'm fake because I use the word Pastor when I'm Catholic. I did some research and pastor is mostly only used in America where I live so that might be why some people aren't used to hearing it.",TwoXChromosomes,1414,1663596754.0,319,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xid7he/my_new_bf_is_creeping_me_out/
The old creep who grabbed my neck while volunteering at my local animal shelter has been dismissed.,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/s/ozwv39PhQ3

After sending my statement to the volunteer coordinator about the old creep who grabbed my neck and “pretended” to strangle me, he was dismissed by management. I was fearful that it would get swept under the rug because I live in a very conservative state (where many women are conditioned to tolerate sexism and inappropriate male behavior) but I’m pleased and relieved that there are still people with integrity and no tolerance for sexist creeps who grab women and think they can get away with it.

I’m proud of myself for reporting because I could have given in to fear, let it go and just never returned like many before me probably did. I could have kept listening to the friend who convinced herself that he was “just quirky, awkward, and autistic.” I have many friends with ASD and none of them have ever grabbed my neck and followed me to make sure I didn’t tell anyone.

After he was dismissed, one of the volunteers found out (the one who the creep referred to as a bitch) and thanked me and said it was like a huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders because she had reported him too. She had witnessed other volunteers avoid coming in when he was there. A friend of a friend volunteered at the same shelter  in 2014 and he had a reputation of being a creep back then too.

To anyone who has been, or currently is, or could potentially be in a similar situation: don’t let anyone try to downplay the situation, or guilt you or blame you for how you react to a predator. The type of criticism that victims receive creates fear of judgment and causes them to avoid coming forward. I’m sure he would have been dismissed sooner if women weren’t fearful of being blamed and judged.

Predators are sneaky. They can be charismatic and helpful, they can flatter you and tell you personal things to build trust and rapport. There are a million ways for them to get you to lower your guard. It takes only a moment for them to go from poking fun to getting you alone with their hands around your throat.

But I hope this outcome encourages others to report if they experience anything like this. And document everything. I had almost a dozen examples of sexist or inappropriate comments and bizarre conduct from him in my report, several of which my friend could corroborate. And after 15+ years, he can no longer harass the hardworking women at my local animal shelter.

Trust yourself and your intuition, especially when it comes to weirdos. Stay safe.

Edit: I was on the fence about filing a police report but after finding out he has been suspended and allowed to return in the past, I went ahead and filed it and he is being charged with a class c misdemeanor. I hope he can never work for the public around women again.",TwoXChromosomes,1795,1755392194.0,38,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1msdaxi/the_old_creep_who_grabbed_my_neck_while/
Apparently my work has a customer who is a serial sexual abuser,"I am a sales associate at a retail store. One night I was walking the store and some old man ran up behind me, laid his hand on the small of my back right above my butt, got close, and said ""hey, how are you, beautiful?"" I said ""fine"", and ran off and lost him. He came back 10 minutes later and started hitting on me again. I got rid of him and hid so he couldn't find me again, he eventually went home. I got so upset that I felt physically ill, like I was violated.

I get creepy old men all the time. They call me names and flirt with me all the time. But that was the first time one actually touched me. I told my female co-workers and most of them knew this guy.

One said he's always pestering her, trying to give her very inappropriate hugs. Another woman says whenever she see him, she hides because last time he offered to pay her for sex and said he was looking for a sexy woman to take with him on vacation. Nobody does anything about it because ""oh, he's just a lonely old man.""

Another coworker had two men following her, hitting on her and trying to get her phone number. After she repeatedly shut them down, they kept following her. Eventually a manager told them to leave her alone. They waited in the parking lot for hours for her and followed her to her car in a dark abandoned parking lot, she had to run.

Anyone who says sexually harassment isn't a big deal isn't on the same planet I'm on. We need to start holding men accountable for this shit because I feel as if people just don't care and brush it under the rug as ""oh, it's just a compliment"" or ""oh, they are just lonely"", fuck that. And if women as a collective don't do anything, they will do the same to others.",TwoXChromosomes,2949,1535730048.0,303,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9buo7u/apparently_my_work_has_a_customer_who_is_a_serial/
I was raped on Thursday and need to talk about the aftermath.,"I was by raped by strangers on Thursday night, my post history talks about that.

I told my husband Saturday night.  He was very supportive, but told me that we absolutely had to go to the police.  So on Sunday morning, we went in to the police station to... give a statement?  Open a claim?  Just tell them I guess.  I had never seen my assailants before.  I don't think I could recognize them if I saw them again.  I know how important it is to tell the police when something like this happens, but, I really didn't want to have to talk about it and relive it with a stranger.

We went in, and since the station is closed on Sundays, had to use the little hand held phone to tell them why we were there.  I naively was under the impression that I could say, ""I was sexually assaulted and need to talk to a police officer.""  I was wrong.  I had to tell the ambiguous stranger on the dinky telephone in the lobby my whole story.  Then he told me to wait while he called someone in to talk to me.  My husband and son were with me and we waited about 20 minutes for an officer to come. 

He took me into a tiny interview room, set up a recorder and a pen and pencil for himself, and asked me to tell him what happened.  He spent most of the time asking me what I feel were irrelevant details-- I gave him the address where my assault took place, and he asked me no less than three times what texture the wall I was pushed up against while I was raped felt like.  He asked me why I didn't have any scratches or abrasions on my face.  It felt like he didn't believe me at all.  He asked me over and over and over where exactly it happened and to tell him exactly word for word all the disgusting things my assailants were yelling at me before they attacked me.  I felt humiliated.  Then, he asked my husband to talk to him alone.

My husband said the officer asked him things like how long we'd been married, were we happy, why was I on a walk alone, etc.  I know these questions are important and he needed to ask them.  But I felt like I was put through the wringer and then dumped onto the lobby floor where my support was immediately removed.  I wasn't able to sit and cry and hold my husband before he was whisked away to verify my story. 

When we were done he said he needed to collect my clothing, which obviously is what he needed to do.  We asked him to please park down the street because we have family visiting right now and I really don't want to have to explain to my sister in law and nieces and mother and father in law why the police are in our driveway.  He didn't.  He parked at the foot of our driveway, where my father in law immediately saw and came to ask what was up.  My husband thankfully was able to make something up and I hid in my bedroom for the rest of the day.

On Monday I went to Planned Parenthood for STI testing and to get resources for counseling.  I have nothing but good things to say about PP, and I will absolutely always support them 100%.  But the visit and the exam were horrific to me, no fault of theirs.

My husband was unable to stay with me because he had to watch our toddler son, who absolutely did not need to be there.  I was there alone, and since I came in as a walk in, I had to wait... a pretty long time.

I have PTSD from my son's very traumatic birth, and my last pap smear and IUD insertion had to be done under sedation/anesthesia because I had panic attacks any time someone came near my vagina in a medical setting.  I knew this was going to be horrific going in.  This is why I wanted Planned Parenthood rather than the hospital, since I knew that PP would take my feelings into consideration and they have training on how to deal with sexual assault, which I honestly am not willing to trust my local hospital to have.

I was given an exam and pre-emptively treated for gonorrea/chlamydia/trichonamisis via pills and an injection, as well as given the ELLA emergency contraceptive.  I was also treated for a yeast infection and examined for damage to my vagina and cervix, and to make sure my IUD had not been dislodged.  The doctor was unable to tell that because of the swelling and inflammation from my attack and the yeast infection.  I am to return to the clinic in 30 days to retest for STIs, get the first of many HIV pricks, and another exam to make sure my IUD is in place.

Today, Tuesday, my husband and I had a concert planned.  We'd bought the tickets months ago and I was so angry that some horrible fucking scum of the earth pieces of shit were going to make me derail my life because they were awful people, so, we decided that we were still going to go.  We had a good time and for awhile I was able to stop thinking about what happened to me.

We got home, and the cat got out.  My husband asked me to leave the side door cracked so he could get in.  I can't.  And now I'm thinking about all this again and I just don't know how I am going to deal with this.  I am so angry that I'm afraid.  I'm so angry that I had to go through a police interrogation, a vaginal exam, a huge dose of hormones (I got the copper IUD because I am suicidal on hormonal birth control), a giant dose of amazingly strong anti-biotics, and, now, the fear of HIV for the next year.  I can't have sex with my husband.  I physically cringed and pushed away my mother in law when she tried to hug me.  I have no patience with my son because I'm just SO ANGRY.

And now I'm worried about the stupid adorable cat who I don't want to get eaten by coyotes.

This was good to get out.  I know it's long, but thank you for reading.  

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support.  It has been really helpful and I really, really appreciate it.  I can't reply to every comment, but again, just thank you so much.

And for the few people that decided to send me hateful PMs, I'm so sorry that your life is so unfulfilling that you feel the need to do that.  I hope you look back in a few years and feel ashamed.

Also, I understand why the officer who took my report asked me so many questions, and I understand that he needed me to repeat myself.  Body language and tone are incredibly important and can change the meaning of things intensely.  I got an officer that was unable to even attempt to be kind or sympathetic, which could have changed our encounter completely.  I don't have any problems with police.  I have had many positive, and a few negative encounters with them over the years, and I understand they are just doing their best, but, at this particular juncture, this officers best was not good enough or helpful to the situation.  I also understand that he needed to talk to my husband.  I think that having someone sit with me while my husband was taken away to talk would have been very helpful, but, I was left all alone after a very intensely humiliating experience and it just made the experience even worse.

But again, I understand and I don't regret going to the police.  I just wish it would have been an easier, more compassionate experience. ",TwoXChromosomes,2604,1469613371.0,430,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4utupn/i_was_raped_on_thursday_and_need_to_talk_about/
"Misdiagnosed, belittled and ignored. Now I'm suffering the consequences","When I hit puberty, everything hurt. My bone were in crippling pain, I couldn't walk from the leg pain and my body changed so rapidly my everything was swollen. The doctor said it was normal growth pains and just gave me painkillers. I suffered for over a week before the fluid bubbles behind my knee finally drained enough for me to walk.

I had my first period at 13 and the pain was so intense I was vomiting, unable to eat, drink or sleep. They just kept getting worse every month and the bleeding was so heavy that I became iron deficient. The doctor said it was a hormonal imbalance and put me on the contraceptive pill (microginonn 30) to ""regulate"" my periods. I developed night terrors, an eating disorder, crazy mood swings and eventually at 18 years old I developed my first breat lump. Doctors biopsied, it wasn't cancer but needed to be removed. The surgery disfigured my breast and left a large scar. They changed my contraceptive pill (cerazette) to avoid more breast lumps.

I'm 20 and my periods have stopped but so too has all libido and natural ""lubrication"" that occurs during intercourse with my long term boyfriend. Doctor says it's my only option and I should use synthetic lubricant to help. A weak later I'm rushed into hospital with a deep vaginal tear from intercourse. They knock me out with high dose morphine and determine I need stitches. I'm discharged but a week later I'm readmitted with a UTI. They give me antibiotics and discharge me. Two days later I'm rushed to intensive care, I have an infection in my bladder, kidneys and liver. I'm in crippling pain and stay in hospital for two weeks. When I'm discharged they recommend stopping the contraceptive pill to reduce a repeat of this kind of infection.

I'm 21 and I have been suffering with panic attacks and violent night terrors. My doctor says I have a hormonal imbalance and puts me on the ""mini pill"" to regulate my menstral cycle. I suffer constant overstimulation, anxiety and panic attacks at work. I am left on long term sick. My doctor says I'm ""emotional unstable"" and depressed. He warns me that "" if I continue like this, things will spiral and get worse. No one will want to know me, no one will love me and I wont be able to get a job. I needs to snap out of it"". He prescribed antidepressants (cypralex) and refers me to a psychologist. The phycologist puts me in CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) . I'm diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, given Coping mechanisms and left to handle it alone. Nothing improves so I decide to stop all medication and connect with a councillor. My mood , relationship, eating habits, periods and sleep drastically improve.

I'm 23 and I've been free from synthetic hormone contraception for over a year. I developed a gradual pain each month that feels like period pain but 100000x worse. I see a specialist in February and they tell me that I have a ""chocolate cyst"" in my left ovary and it will need surgery. They schedule the surgery for August of the same year. In that 6 Months the pain rapidly worsens. I got stiff and eventually can no longer stand up straight as somethitis pulling me into a fetal position. Whilst waiting for the surgery I'm giving ibuprofen to ""manage the pain"". When the surgery happens they find the cyst has.grom from a pea size to the size of an orange, wrapped around my fallopian tube and adhered to my bowel. The surgery take 6 hours, it's endometriosis and in removing everything they are forced to take half of my left ovary. They inform me thaty fertility will be extremely limited and that I must have a hormonal birth control IUD to prevent the endometriosis returning. I'm devastated.

I'm 28, my mind is constantly racing, I'm over analytical, struggling with rejection and hyper fixating on many topics of interest. I speak to my doctor and request an ADHD and autism assessment. I'm placed on a waiting list. 
My fiance a lnd I want to try for a baby, we have the IUD removed. I have blood work to test my iodine levels and they're worrying. I see a thyroid specialist who does an ultrasound and discovers I have Hashimotos disease. I'm given thyroxin meds and told I need to take them forever, but nothing more. two weeks later I'm pregnant. . 
The first 7 months of pregnancy is hell, I have extreme morning sickness and cannot hold down food. I'm in and out of hospital for checks and IV fluids. They discover a new cyst growing on my left ovary and blocking my cervix. They're concerned I cannot give birth safely but will ""wait and see"".
My daughter is born early at 37 weeks, the labour is 14 hours long. I have so much damage that ""you'll need cosmetic surgery to fix this"".

5 years go by and my mental state has worsened due to being a first time mum and covid preventing me from seeing my family. I start to notice ADHD and autism traits even more. My night terrors worsen, I'm given antipsychotics (quetapin) to help me sleep. I've been on the waiting list for an ADHD assessment and autism assessment for almost a decade. Eventually I decline enough to be sent to an mental clinic. The lead doctor believes ADHD and autism is a tiktok trend and I'm just depressed. After 6 weeks in the clinic, I'm sent home with a PTSD diagnosis and modern antidepressants. The psychologist from the clinic determines that I am neuro divergent but cannot precisely narrow it down. 

Another year goes by and a male friend from the clinic contacts me to tell me he was told he might have autism whilst in the clinic and his doctor referred him to a colleague who just diagnosed him with autism. I ask for this doctor's number. A month later I'm assessed and diagnosed as autistic. The same level and severity as my brother who was diagnosed as a child and has never worked a day in his life due to being told he is unfit to work by rh social support team. At this point in I'm my late 30's 

I see a female psychiatrist who explains that based on my symptoms she believes I'm audhd and prescribed me ADHD meds (Elvanse). My crippling anxiety and chronic overthinking, instantly vanish. I feel so much better. I ween off of my ""modern antidepressants"" and I continue to improve. I have a lot more clarity and begin to look forward to things.

4 months go by and my life has vastly improved. Yet my heart rate is continuing to be dangerously high. Never dropping below 90 and constantly in 130-150 range most of the day. Also, my joints hurt every morning and whenever I stand from crouching or sitting on the floor, I have a sharp pain in my head that radiates down the side of my face and jaw. The doctor does blood work and a heart monitor rest for 24hrs. The blood work is fine but they confirm the heart rate is high but ""they aren't too concerned"" and so nothing further happens. 2 months later and my joint pain has worsened and my weight loss is drastic. I push the doctor for more investigation into the cause of the heart rate, head pain and joint pain. They run more blood work and again it's normal. The doctor believes that it could be my bones weakened from the prolonged use of thyroid medication and Quintapin. I'm now waiting on an orthopedic specialist appointment.


All through my life I've been treated like a hormonal little girl and doctors either dismiss me of take the easy way out with generalised hormonal medication. Now, as I approach 40, the reality is I have multiple genetic conditions that have been ignored and misdiagnosed. Consequently I'm now facing damage and pain long term, all because doctors assumed everything was to do with my menstral cycle or hormones. Only after I argued and pushed did any investigations take place which finally identified the causes and not the symptoms.

How to deal with catcalling,"This happened a couple of years ago, but it was so remarkably effective I thought I’d share. I have used this method several times since and it always has the desired effect.I was walking along minding my own business when some guy hanging outside a CVS said something to the effect of “Hey honey, why don’t you come over here and give me a kiss?” The sidewalk was rather wide, so he was several feet away from me. I stepped towards him and started screaming as loud as I possibly could. After several seconds, he called me a ”Crazy bitch.” I continued to scream. The street wasn’t super busy, but there were other people around who were now looking in my direction wondering what was happening. A couple more seconds went by, and the guy started to walk away. So I followed him, still screaming (I did have to stop for a couple of seconds to inhale). When he got to the street corner, he turned around and shouted “Get away from me, you crazy bitch!” And took off running.We all know that the purpose of catcalling is to make women feel uncomfortable, so why not turn things around?

"""What kind of attitude is that?!""","It's currently 1:25 am where I live. I started my period early and realized I have no tampons. So, I grab my pepper spray and start toward the nearest plaid pantry, about ten minute walk from my place. 

As I walk, some dude pulls into the parking lot and drives slowly beside me, trying to get my attention (""hey, baby."" ""What you doing cutie"" ""Wanna party?"") I ignore him and continue walking, pepper spray at the ready. He pulls forward and parks. Gets out of his car. I cross the street. He gets back in his car and pulls into the street, but can't get near me as I was facing onward traffic. He stops in the middle of the fucking street and *shouts* at me from his car. So, I tell him to fuck off. He gets mad and shouts ""Fucking bitch. What kind of attitude is that?!"" And finally drives off. 


Um. That's the attitude of a freaked out person that you are trying to approach in the middle of the night repeated after they clearly show they don't want to talk to you. In what world is that appropriate behavior? When has that ever worked for you? Do you just get off on scared women and were angry I wasn't scared of you? 


Well, fuck off and learn how to interact with people.


Edit: Many people seem to believe if I had politely told him no, the situation wouldn't have happened. No, that is not how it works. I am not threatening my safety to be ""polite"" to a man who is stalking me.

Many people also have stated he probably thought I was a hooker. Well, he didn't. Most hookers don't actively avoid potential money or dress the way I did.


I do not live in the Ghetto. This is not a race issue. Not that it matters, but this guy was a white dude in a nicer, newer minivan. Dude was most likely solid middle class. Once again, this is not a race or a financial issue, it's an entitlement and respect issue.


Also, I was not being serious when asking ""does that ever work for you?"" It doesn't, and they don't care. It's a power issue. They're getting what they want when women are frightened and uncomfortable. I was venting about a common issue on a women's site.  

I reacted correctly, speaking as someone who experiences harassment on a regular basis.

Didn't expect this to blow up!

And stop giving me suggestions on how to handle harassment. I've experienced street harassment since I was 12 years old. No, it does not happen every day, but it does happen.

I had a Medical Abortion. Thankyou to all the women who helped guide me," Weeks ago, I came to reddit to find advice and reliable first hand experience about how to go about the difficult topic of abortion. I found some very good information dating back years on the steps to take and what having an abortion was going to be like. This is partly for my own benefit to process events, but more to guide anyone else who is going through the same things that I did and is struggling to come to the decisions I have made. 
 This is going to be a long one, so I'll try to format if you want to skip to the important parts

 
Background: 
  I'm self employed in my mid twenties. I've had a LDR for the past three years with a guy from another country (yay for reddit) and hadn't had sex in atleast 5 years. It was a bit of a sudden visit from him for a two month stay. I hadn't been on any form of birth control in years. My family on both sides hasn't had a very fertile history, and I had had a miscarriage as a teenager that convinced me I wasnt likely to get pregnant. In hindsight, I was a moron.  I've always been very aware of my cycle through my emotions, and the boyfriend was set to arrive a few days before my period.  
 He arrived and my time of the month came early, ruining my first sexual interaction in 5 years. Just my luck. So for the first five days of his visit, I was curled in a ball having an abnormally painful period. He was great about it. The next weekend was when we had my first enjoyable sexual experiences, and then my last truely enjoyable to date at the end of the weekend. 

  The pregnancy: 
 It didn't make sense until my ultrasound. The dates and emotions all lined up perfectly in my mind the moment the lady confirmed that weekend was the date of conception. Monday and Tuesday was hell for me. I have always been in touch with my hormones and generally a happy person though always stressed. I've had my down times, but I felt like killing myself. For those two days there was nothing to the world. I have never felt that before, and hope to never again. It got better for a few days, until I got the news that my business was shut down. I was the only supplier in my area left to the only distributor within hundreds of miles of a specialty product. My world for the past 5 years had been building that business, and I never even thought that they would cut me. It wrecked me completely. 
 The next few weeks I just assumed the depression and my hormones were taking a huge toll on my body. My breasts were really sensitive. Any time I got aroused I was cramping in agony. Sex was just painful no matter how shallow or gentle he was. I could barely sleep. I had no sex drive and just wanted to be left alone. The Bf was amazing through all of it though.
  I didn't suspect pregnancy at all until at 3 weeks I woke up after two hours of sleep. My insides were all being squeezed. It felt like I had something that wanted to come out of all 4 holes and I couldn't figure out if I should aim towards or away from the toilet first. I was shaking and light headed and had sweat pouring out of me for nearly an hour. I guess that's what my morning sickness feels like. 

 I was panicking. My life has already had enough problems. I'm broke and broken. I've been drinking and smoking heavily. The father is in this country temporarily. I have people scouting me out to move for a new job. A child, let alone being a single mother isn't in the plans for my high strung self. This explains the pain I've been going through. If it's this bad this soon in, how much pain and discomfort would I be having further along? I knew what needed to happen. He did too.    
 After quickly looking at the price of my options, out of desperation I took a drug that is known to induce a period, that has induced me before. I wont name it, because it didn't work and the side effects of puking, diarrhea, cramps, and panic attack wasnt worth it. I've had bad judgement till now, and rather than trying it again to see if it might work...I looked at my options again.  At this point, he was leaving in a week. I was terribly sensitive to smell and honestly couldn't be in the same room with him or another person without gagging at the smells or foods that normally wouldn't bother me. I was having heavy cramps nearly on the hour every day. My quality of life was terrible, but I didn't want to go through the abortion while he was still here. I just wanted to enjoy my time with him for as long as I could. 

Planned Parenthood: Before the Appointment 

 I don't have much money to spare with the uncertainty of a career. I don't have medical insurance that's worth what I pay. The advice I found online was to go to your doctor ( which I don't actually have a GP) to get a referral to an OB... which sounded pricey and uncertain or go directly to Planned Parenthood.  The closest clinic is nearly two hours away. I called and said I'd like to book an appointment for an abortion. I asked for a Medical Abortion rather than Surgical. This was so I could drive myself without asking my father. He knew and supported my decision, but I didn't want to bother him.  Also, I've had a miscarriage long ago and I wanted this to be a private moment for me. She told me the pricing on the phone of about seven hundred dollars and they would only take cash or card. She said Protesters are common, just dont interact with them. Security wont let them into the building.  The appointment was less than a week away. I got there in time for my appointment to pay upfront and fill out consent forms, but had to wait atleast another hour until they finally called me back. 

Planned Parenthood: At the Clinic

 ""What is your full name? What is your birthdate?  Alright hunny. We have you scheduled for a medical abortion, is that correct? Okay. I'm going to have you step into the bathroom. Urine goes in the cup, and stick this long cotton swab inside your vagina and swirl it along the sides. I'll be in the next room when you're done.""
 In the next room,  I was asked to take off my pants and get on the table. The ultrasound stick thingy went in me and I saw the baby. I won't lie, I had hormones all telling me how precious it was and the wonder of it growing in me. But I also knew at this time in life, I needed to put myself first and the baby wouldn't be growing up in an ideal environment for everyone involved. More than anything, environment is the reason I could not keep my little one. It was estimated at 7 weeks, one day. With a buffer of two days on either side. We've got the pictures. 20 minutes total. It's time for step two of the process. 

 I was sent with a packet of birth control information and a picture to the education office. A girl came in and asked questions regarding my safety, if I was making this decision on my own, and if it really is the right decision for me. She was supportive of my breakdown and let me know about services offered for this type of situation.  I got my blood taken to determine if I was anemic, and educated on how to take the pills, what to expect, and how to identify and react if something is going very wrong. Any questions at all: Call. I was then given an antibiotic to take that night, Misoprostol, and Ibuprofen.  40 minutes in there. Time for the Doctor. 

 I waited for 20 minutes in her office gagging from the smell of their lunch. I just wanted out of there. She came in and asked me to recite how to take all of the pills. She gave me a prescription to fill for Tylenol Codeine and told me to take Mifeprostone pill in front of her. Out I went with plans to take the Misoprostol the next night. 

The day of the Abortion: Mifeprostone

I had things to do. I wanted to make sure I could be out of action for a solid two days just in case. That morning I pushed myself hard. At 1pm, the Mifeprostone started to work better than intended. It was just supposed to stop growth of the fetus. Instead, I was cramping and squeezing out clots every time I bent over. I was not ready for this to happen yet. I scheduled it for 5pm that night.  I wasn't sure if this was right, but decided not to call like they said to and just to take the Misoprostol as instructed.  I had food earlier in the day since I was warned I may throw up and wouldn't have an appetite.  I set out an old comforter on the bed. A trash can with plastic bags, and got comfortable.  I took the tylenol. I went to play a video game as I placed the Misoprostol in the back of my lower gums and cheek.  

Misoprostol: 
 Twenty minutes past and I hate the feeling of chalk. I swallowed early out of disgust. Then frantically googled to see if I just fucked up by swallowing early, even though the first pill was already causing me to abort. Within ten minutes I felt nauseous and light headed, with the cramps from the Mifepristone causing me pain, but I was prepared that there was more to come
  I laid down in bed. It's now about 6:30 as the process is starting. Most of the internet people say the worst will be from the 2-7 hour mark. An hour went by of moderate pain while I was running out of the room to the bathroom. I wasnt filling the pads squirting out blood, although twice it was running down my leg. My abdomen felt like it was on fire as I had convulsions of blood and large clots being forced out of me, but the entrance kept getting blocked and uncomfortable. So I would go squat on the toilet and hear the clots pour out. A few times I missed the bowl as it rushed out whenever I slightly bent over. I checked as many clots as I could to find anything identifiable. 
 At around 10pm, the pain was uncomfortable but felt like it was slowing. I had the boyfriend on the phone and asked him to just be with me for a while. I was crying constantly from emotional and physical pain. I wanted to take a shower because I felt so disgusting and it just seemed like a good idea to have hot water on me. The shower had the hottest water possible as I was bending over with it on my lower back for a long time. It lessened the cramps. Suddenly the pain hit me hard. And it just kept getting worse, and worse, then completely unbearable and light headed and dizzy. I started to panic that I would pass out, bloody and naked in the shower. It was likely that the person to find me is the one person who I hope never finds out that I did this. I needed to get out of the shower right now.  I stumbled soaking wet out of the shower and fell into bed with only a towel underneath me. That's my last memory before I passed out from the pain. 


 Nearly three hours later I woke up freezing, naked, with a towel covered in blood. I'm fairly sure that I should have called as I know what was covering the towel was more than soaking through four pads in two hours. I didn't. Why? I knew I was me again. I woke up feeling like the fog of hormones had cleared. I didn't feel depressed. From the past 2 months of pain, I had a realization that hormones made me not handle it nearly as well as I could have. For the first time in 7 weeks... I felt like me again.  I have never been so relieved in my life. I was still in pain. I was still bleeding. I looked through the clots and was very disappointed. When I had my miscarriage as a teenager I saw it, although my first was much further along than 7 weeks, (and admittedly less painful than this was) I regret that I didn't get to really see my little one to mourn how I wanted to. I have the picture. But touch was wanted more. 
 
I continued to be in pain for another few hours, but managed to find some food and function, then go to bed. For the next week I couldn't lift anything or bend over without feeling blood squirt out of me. It was still painful for days. It took a week of light bleeding and some mucously, kinda smelly discharge to come out. A day of nothing, and then bright red blood coming out which scared me. I did a quick search and found that it can be something like new cells in the uterus shedding, so I didn't call the clinic, once again. I'm not phone shy, I just didn't want to be a bother.

 The follow up 

 For Planned Parenthood, the abortion services and follow ups or complications that can be treated by the clinic are all included in the upfront price. I had an ultrasound scheduled for two weeks after the initial appointment to check to see of any tissue needs cleared out. I typed the majority of this as I waited in the clinic. I stopped bleeding completely after 11 days. The ultrasound showed clear of all tissue. 


 I have never needed to use PP before, but I'm so thankful that I did everything how I did it. I'm even more thankful to the rest of the women who have posted online, guiding me through their private and painful experience to make me feel informed of what the experience was going to be like, and comforted by those who have done it before me.",TwoXChromosomes,4784,1577988586.0,165,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ej1r8t/i_had_a_medical_abortion_thankyou_to_all_the/
I’ve been stalked by the same creep for 8 years and I have no way to make it stop,"This is going to be one of those non-feel good posts where I vent about being powerless in an absolute shituation. 

I(F29) have been stalked by the same man(M47?) for about 8 years now. All of it is done via email these days. It started when I was about 21 and we worked at the same place. My job was to answer phones at that place and one day he started using his lunch break to sit in a parking lot across the street and call the phone of our business literally every five seconds for the whole hour he was out there. Twice he sent flowers to my job for me, but used my email address to send them. I tried calling flower place and they said they couldn’t tell me the name on the credit card. Several times after work, I would be sitting in traffic to see that he was following me. He lived in the complete opposite direction and would follow me and try to make eye contact before turning off the road and leaving. After a few months of unsuccessful interventions by my employer, I quit. After that, the emails started. At first, they came from his personal email. Then, he started making new emails. All of the emails had the year he was born in them, like his personal email. I think he did that so I would know it was him. I have been getting these emails for years. Sometimes they are angry (but not violent?). Sometimes they aren’t. One time he emailed asking if I would spend the night with him for $1000. I was young, alone, and lived in the city and eventually I just never felt safe in that city so I moved. Far. I made myself un-googleable and got rid of/privatized all of my social media. I moved to texas after graduating from college and became a teacher. 
The emails are still coming. A few months ago he made a linkedin profile for ME using MY work email. I only found out because I got the notification and a separate email from him basically letting me know that he knows where I work and live. I just got another one that says he is visiting my city soon and he can’t wait to see me. 

What can I do with all of this information to help myself? I have the emails saved. I went to the police back when everything first started happening and was told basically there was nothing I could do. The detective I spoke with said that stalking laws are built around domestic abuse laws, and since we were never in a relationship there wasn’t anything I could do unless this guy actually threatened or hurt me. I don’t want either of those things to ever happen and I have lived my life for the last eight years being scared and reminded that it could. Just posted on r/legaladvice and was pretty much told them same thing. I just hate this whole thing. Inaction feels unsafe. Action feels unsafe. I feel unsafe.",TwoXChromosomes,1470,1676914088.0,228,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/117etbz/ive_been_stalked_by_the_same_creep_for_8_years/
"If my ex had gotten his way, I'd be sharing a twin size bed with him, living in his mom's house, working at the local grocery store in a rural little town","Ten years ago this year, I was selected for a residential internship-like program. I had to move across the country for it. The program was a year long and immediately followed my college graduation. As a 21 year old, I was excited for the new adventure.

The day I found out I was accepted, I told my boyfriend at the time, Sean.

""You're not going to do it, right?"" He asked. 

He didn't want me to leave him. And while the thought of being long distance sucked, I wanted the experience. I told him that I would be doing the program and that I would help come up with a plan for our shared apartment. 

Every day between learning about the program and leaving for it, Sean grumbled to me. Why didn't I stay local and look for a job around our college town? Sean had a couple of more semesters left in his grad program so he couldn't move with me. I thought about what it would mean to turn down the program. It would mean missing out on cool travel opportunities and work experience that I wouldn't get if I stayed in College Town, USA. I told Sean that I loved him a lot but I needed to do this. 

I had reasons to believe that Sean would still be living in our apartment when my program ended. He told me there were a few organizations that recruited heavily from his grad program and he felt certain he could get a job with one of them after graduation. I left all of our shared furniture and kitchen stuff in our apartment and packed up my personal items like clothes with me. My program paid for my housing and food and Sean decided that he could pay for our one bedroom by himself. 

The program was challenging and at times not very fun. On video calls with Sean, he reminded me that I should have just stayed with him in our college town.

The year progressed. Sean finished his program but couldn't find a job in town. The lease of our apartment ended and he decided to pack everything up and move back to his mom's house. She lived two hours away in an area so rural that the house didn't even have a provider for internet. 

""Don't worry,"" Sean told me. ""There's room for you here. And I have a Hotspot. It's not great for streaming. But you could do job applications and check emails."" 

It was nice that Sean told me that. My own mother told me that she rented out my childhood bedroom and that there was no room for me at her place. 

Sean got a part time job at a grocery store. He told me that he was looking far and wide for a full time professional job and we could move together wherever that was. 

As my program started to come to an end, I also started my own job search. And it wasn't long before I found a full time professional job in my degree area. The experience I had gained in my internship had paid off! But the job was about 500 miles from where Sean lived with his mom in an unknown town. 

When I told Sean, I thought he would be happy for me. The New Town was unfamiliar to both of us but it looked like it had plenty of opportunities for Sean.

""You're not going to take it, right?"" Sean asked when I told him. 

""Actually,"" I said. ""I am.""

I explained how I didn't want to live at his mom's house. Sean slept in a twin size bed in a room hardly bigger than a closet. I imagined trying to make that work with the two of us.

""Well,"" Sean replied. ""You can take the job. But I'm not moving with you. And I'm not doing long distance."" 

I felt devastated. But I imagined what it would feel like to turn down a job doing what I went to school for only to sit unemployed at my boyfriend's mom's house all day. The house was small. It had one bathroom. I had to walk through my boyfriend's mom's bedroom to access the kitchen. I felt grateful that it was even an option because otherwise, I might have faced homelessness. But if I had any other choice, I would not be moving there.

""Okay,"" I told Sean. ""I'll think about it.""

Later that day, I signed my acceptance paperwork for the job. 

Sean was irate. 

""You didn't even talk to me about this first,"" he hissed. I had. He had given me his ultimatum. I understood perfectly. 

With my offer letter, I was able to sign for a one bedroom apartment at a brand new complex, one with a giant pool in the middle and a gym. It was an entrance to the middle class that felt too good to be true. Sean and I both hadn't grown up without a lot of money. Actually, that was an understatement. Sean had grown up in abject poverty.  

I told Sean that he didn't have to move but if he could help me bring my stuff to my new place, I'd be appreciative. He agreed.

""Woah, this place is very nice,"" Sean commented when he saw it.

He decided to stay and I felt so happy. I felt so alone in this new town and Sean felt like warmth and home, even with the ugly ultimatum he had given me. 

Within a month, Sean found a job in his degree field in New Town. 

And I wish this was the end of the story. That Sean apologized to me for discouraging me from doing the internship program or taking the job. That he told me that my hard work had paid off. 

No. Instead, Sean complained to me and constantly compared New Town to College Town. In College Town, we lived in a bar district and could walk to go get a drink. In New Town, we had to drive to get to a bar. Sean hated that we had to limit ourselves so that we could drive home. On Saturday nights, he reminded me that in College Town, we would be at a house party. 

Sean missed College Town so much that I suggested we both look for jobs there. With some more work experience,  we might be better candidates than when we were fresh from school. I found a job first and told Sean that if he would like to break the lease and move with me, I'd make enough to support both of us while he looked for a job. Sean told me that he didn't want to be my dependent and that he would prefer to stay in our current place in the town he hated rather than be unemployed. 

Of course, I understood this. I was just glad that he didn't insist I give up my job opportunity back in College Town. 

It took Sean another two months to find a job in College Town. I thought his homecoming would be jubilant. But he was sad and bitter. A lot of our college friends had moved from the area in the two years we had lived in New Town. We also didn't want to live near the university because of the noise and higher crime rate. Instead, we opted to live about 15 minutes away from the students and the bar district that served them. 

Our move back to College Town felt very similar as our move to New Town. We didn't know that many people. Our part of town was unfamiliar. We still weren't going to house parties every Saturday night like we were when we were students. And Sean was even more bitter. 

I'm not sure what actions we could have taken to have made Sean happy. But I know that the two of us fought about the move to New Town often. In fact, six years after the move down and four years after the move back up, we had one more final blowout fight about it. And that was the end of the relationship. I remember Sean's ultimatum. And it feels funny to know that he was sort correct. Taking the job was the beginning of the end of our relationship. Even if the break up took years to brew. It was me that ended it. I couldn't live with his constant resentment anymore. 

And I think often about what would have happened if Sean had gotten his way. Would I be a manager at the grocery store in his mom's rural town sharing a twin size bed?

was just raped by the QB at my highschool and I'm not sure what to do. I'm scared to tell even my best friend because I don't know what he'll think or say.,"I'm really sorry this is so long. This just happened and I know I'm rambling but I really really need advice right now.

There was a group of us hanging out on the beach including my best friend (I'm calling him Jay) and some of the football kids and their QB who we're gonna call Drew for this post. I wasn't drinking much but Drew was pretty shitfaced pretty quickly. Long story short: cops show up, everyone books it in opposite directions, Drew and I end up walking down the street together alone becaue everyone is off hiding or whatever. We're not close friends but I know his house is a few blocks away and I also know he's not gonna make it home if I don't walk him there. We get to his house and he pitches forward on his front steps so I figure I have to walk him inside. I open the door for him and he shoves me inside and nonconsensual shit happens; I'm not gonna elaborate.

Once he got off of me he just rolled over and passed out and I ran outside and I was hyperventilating then I puked and walked straight to the 24hr convenience store and I didn't even think that entire time I don't know how to describe it I just walked. once I got there I bought plan B and then I didn't know what to do so I called Jay. He picked up and was pretty groggy because he's been home and probably asleep for awhile and I asked him to please pick me up and he told me to send him my location. When his car drove up and he got out he was like ""are you alright?"" and I just started crying like fucking losing it and I don't remember much after that just that I collapsed and he picked me up and then next thing I knew I was on his bed and he was handing me a sweatshirt and asking me if I wanted tea or I wanted to tell him what happened.

I then turned into mega bitch and was like ""no, no I dont"" and he kept being like ""are you sure?"" and I was like ""leave me alone"" like I don't know why I was like that. I looked up at him and he looked really hurt. I said I was really sorry and that the last thing I would ever want to do is hurt him because its true. He's my best friend and I would never want to make him feel bad. Next thing I know he's wrapping me in a hug and I jumped back and slapped him away. I didn't even mean to do that it's so hard to explain and he looked at me in absolute shock and I started to cry again and he gave me another hug and we just sat there. we both fell asleep like that and I just woke up and everything came flooding back to me and I could feel this really tight feeling in my chest and throat and I just felt really uncomfortable. I love writing and sometimes writing things out helps me feel better so I'm kinda just lying here and I'm typing on mobile so I'm sorry if there's any mistakes or if I'm rambling it's just hard to organize my thoughts right now. I've been on reddit and seen people get really great advice for financial and personal struggles and all that so I thought maybe as a girl I could post on this sub and get some advice from literally anyone who is willing to help.

Both his parents and my mom are at a wedding tonight and they're staying over at the destination so I'm just at his house. I feel really lost right now. I've never been a jumpy person and I'm never emotional like I *never* cry and I feel awful about the way that I've been treating Jay and I also just feel overall shitty and I have no idea what to do from here. I want with all my heart to tell Jay about Drew but at the same time I don't want anyone to know. Jay and I have been close since 2nd grade and we're the same person in every way and we share everything with each other. But I'm scared about the way that he and everyone else is going to react about this. my dad passed away when I was in 5th grade and from then up until honestly just a couple years ago, all I got was looks of pity and people treating me like I was fragile when I mentioned my dad. That is the *last* thing I want and I know that's what I'll get if I talk about this.

I feel like this is an ok place to talk because I can just share what I'm actually feeling but then I can log off and no one will know. I've never felt more conflicted about anything in my entire life. I'm also pissed at myself that I didn't do anything more to stop him and that it happened at all in the first place like Jesus Christ I know the statistics I should've known not to put myself in that situation. I'm lost right now and just looking for any kind of advice anyone offers.

~~Edit: about the hospital, I'm not an adult so I don't think that I can go and get tested for anything without having the people tell my mom~~ Ok so I just found out that since I'm 16 or over I can go to the ER and not have them call my mom. If I do ever report it I wouldn't want to make really hard for the police so I'm also taking other people's advice and I put my clothes in a bag and I haven't showered yet either. Whenever Jay wakes up I'll probably just ask him to drop me home so I can drive to the ER.

People react differently if a dark skin man vs a light skin man harasses me,"If a black/Latino man harasses me, everyone believes me and those men are disgusting predators.

If a white/Asian man harasses me, everyone thinks I misunderstood and I should have more empathy for them.

I was at a club where my friend works. I told him one of the white male employees was following me into the bathroom. He told me not to worry about it because that guy does it to all of the women. A Latino man walked up to me to hit on me. He wasn't being creepy or scary. He just walked up to me and this same friend BARKED at him like a dog.

My ex white girl friend would only notice a man is creepy if he was black. If the man was asian/white, she had on her blinders. She made excuses for them. They're little babies and babies can't be rapists.

Other women would ask me additional questions if I warned them about a black man. Absolutely nothing when I warn them about an asian/white man. He's never done anything to them so why should they be worried.

The racism is astounding.

Married man groped me under the table,"I'm so fucking frustrated. I went to this party at a restaurant. Maybe 10-15 people. I was sitting across from a newly married couple. They are expecting a child soon and they way they look at each other is so adorable and loving. She is smart and funny and all around a really amazing woman. He seemed thoughtful and kind.

When I sat down, he did look at me in a way kind of made me feel uncomfortable. I tried to ignore it because they really did seem happy together and I wanted to believe that I was being silly. Then I dropped something on the floor under the table. He was sat right across from me. When he saw the item fall, he grinned and said ""don't worry, I got you"". I said thank you and then I suddenly felt his hand on my leg under the table. I jumped and looked to see him holding the item while trying to run his fingers on my bare leg. I love wearing dresses but I deeply regretted wearing one that day. 

Why did he hand it to me under the table? That was so fucking weird. So I spent the rest of the dinner not making eye contact. At one point his wife when to the restroom and he made comments about her weight. Specifically, how you can't tell she's pregnant because of her size. I felt sick to my stomach. I don't know her well but she is obviously a beautiful and amazing woman and this guy is so gross.

At the end of the night I managed to avoid them when we were hugging goodbye. But when they walked out together, his eyes never left me as they walked away. 

What was going through his mind? What is the expectation? Am I supposed to be swoon over a man who treats his wife like that? 

I feel sick to my stomach over it. I'm so angry at him. I feel like I can't say anything to anyone because it wasn't blatant. It could be attributed to a misunderstanding. I feel like I'd sound like a crazy person if I even said anything. 

I'm just going to be sure to check the guest list for any future events and avoid going if that couple will be there. 

I'm a little worried that he might figure out which phone number is mine in the group text. At least I'll have concrete proof of something weird if he attempts to contact me. 

When people wonder why I don't socialize more, this is why. I struggle to just live my life every damn day because of men. It has gotten worse since I have decided to be alone and just do my own thing. It's as if my disinterest has caused the men around me to go rabbid for my attention.

Story time! I chased a creep with a shovel to get him away from me,"To preface, I had no intention of actually physically harming him. I would have had it been necessary, but my primary concern was getting him the hell away from me. I didn't have my phone and needed to pick my daughter up from her grandparents. 

I came home to grab something and had just pulled into my driveway. My street is not the safest, but it's also not the most dangerous, so while I'm typically on guard to an extent, I've gotten fairly comfortable on my own property. It was dark, I was alone and gathering my keys and then suddenly a man came up to my window. I cracked it and asked wtf he was doing on my property, and he just kept asking my name and if he could have a ride. I obviously told him no and to get off my property. 

I'm not sure what came over me; I think my fight response kicked into high gear, which is strange because I typically try to keep a safe distance. I flung open my car door and started acting aggressivel,  and got him to back up enough for me to get to my front door. I again told him to leave, and he kept trying to beckon me over to give him a lighter, but like, fuck that. 

I threw a lighter at him, told him he needed to be gone by the time I came back out, and if I saw him again I wouldn't be so nice. I grabbed what I came home for, and when I reached my front door, I could hear him outside yelling something. All I caught was ""lighter"" and ""bitch"". I was pissed. 

I have a very large and heavy shovel in my enclosed front porch. I grabbed it, walked out, and told him this was his last chance. He saw the shovel and fucking *smirked* as if to say ""you won't"". I was scared because I didn't expect him to call my bluff like that, and then I heard my dad's voice in my head. He told me that if i ever got in a dangerous situation and I knew I'd lose the fight, to act absolutely insane and it may save me.

I hiked the shovel over my shoulder like you would a baseball bat and started running at him full speed, screaming at the top of my lungs that ""you better start running"" ""I'm gonna f*ck you up"" and many other expletives. 

He ran, yelling, ""OH SHIT OH SHIT"" the entire time, and I've never felt better. I'm tired of men trying to intimidate me. I'm tired of them thinking they have that power over me. Not anymore; my shovel is now rated E for everyone.

Still shaking. Texted with Uber ADT safety agent. Should I report this driver?,"*Edit/update:* Hi everybody - thank you for your responses. I have a small update. I had some trouble navigating the app to report, but good news is, the ADT Safety agent's documentation did it for me. Uber support sent me a message referencing my contacting the ADT safety agent, apologizing, refunding the trip, and saying they would ""take appropriate steps to address this incident with your driver."" Highly recommend using that ADT safety feature, it was very helpful for me and just fyi if you ever use it, it looks like it automatically creates a report. I think that's a nice touch, bc if/when you're frazzled afterwards, it makes it easier for you.



I appreciate a lot of these comments. Most are very helpful and kind. That said, I would also appreciate if you could refrain from certain types of comments. Some of these are making me feel pretty bad. Yes, part of the reason why I felt stupid was that maybe I was overreacting, but the other reason why was that I felt silly for not managing to get out earlier and silly for thinking it was an overreaction. And while I'm sure people mean well, some of these comments are making me feel worse about that. Please excuse me if I'm misreading things, but some of them read like I'm an idiot for ever hesitating. That's not very helpful. It was confusing and I was tired and it wasn't totally clear cut in the moment; he's a 4.99 star driver with 5000 rides, it was raining so hard the streets were running like rivers, and there weren't many opportunities to pull over. I got out when I did, and it's reported now, and that's what matters.



Thank you all, and good night.

Hi everybody. This just happened and I'm not really sure what to do next.



I was in an Uber leaving the city. We were about to enter the tunnel to leave the city and he says he's really sorry but something's wrong with his tire, the pressure, and he thinks it's unsafe and doesn't want to risk going on the highway without getting it fixed. I asked him what that meant, like does that mean he has to cancel the ride, and he said no he just has to fix it first and it should be pretty quick. It's also dark and pouring rain (like, biblical rain) and crazy traffic outside. I say ok bc I don't really know what else to do. I do feel a little on edge bc it doesn't feel right, but I'm not sure what to do. So I start frantically looking through the safety features in the app. But I also feel stupid, like maybe my instincts are wrong and it's totally fine and I should just calm down.




But then it takes really long, like we go far enough that we're now closer to the other, uptown tunnel. We pass a gas station and I ask him why he can't just go there to add air to his tires and he says he needs more than that and we need to go to a shop. This feels like a massive red flag to me. I ask him where we're going then, specifically? And he just says some shop and we're really close and it shouldn't take long. I'm starting to get a little freaked out bc while he seemed like a normal guy, it just feels shady. I asked him to pull over and let me out, bc I see a pharmacy. He says the shop and the tunnel are both so close it doesn't make sense for me to get out now bc it'd be a waste of my time and it'd be impossible for me to get another car in this traffic in this rain near the tunnel and it'll just be harder for me, and he apologizes again. Car drives past the pharmacy.



Earlier, I'd opened the safety button in the Uber app and I started texting with an ADT Safety agent. She tells me it's weird and not normal and I should try to get out of the car. She said if a driver has an issue with their car that they need fixed, they're supposed to end the trip and then go to get it fixed. Knowing this is the final red flag that freaks me out. She tells me again to try and get out. I see a hotel the next block and I tell him to please drop me off. We argue a bit, and I feel kind of bad bc it was tense. But I was really freaked out at this point. He does pull over and I get out. He drives away and I feel so weird and dramatic for it, but I'm shaking and crying and don't even know why.



The ADT safety agent was super nice, told me she was glad I was out of the car. She said it's really weird and she's never heard of a driver doing that before, and that I should report him, and she sent me a link.



Should I report him? I was seriously freaked out and felt unsafe. And he didn't follow protocol. But what if it's just a misunderstanding? If anything, he probably thinks I was upset bc of wasted time--no! I was upset bc I felt unsafe and it just got shadier and shadier and weirder and weirder. If it's just a misunderstanding and it's an important source of income for him or something, I'd feel pretty guilty causing trouble. But at the same time, he should've done what the ADT safety agent said was protocol and ended the trip to get his car fixed and dropped me off somewhere away from the tunnel entrance mouth so I could safely get another ride. I feel conflicted and am still pretty shaken, so please be kind.",TwoXChromosomes,1110,1722733307.0,149,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ejiyqy/still_shaking_texted_with_uber_adt_safety_agent/
I've had two abortions. I want to inform you of what it is like.,"First of all, I know I am going to receive comments that are hateful toward me posting this information. However, my intention is inform ladies that possibly are in the same situation I was in. Before anyone tells me I was irresponsible, you are wrong. The first time I got pregnant, we were using condoms and we are assuming it tore at some point and we did not realize it...because I was unpleasantly informed I was pregnant. I was on birth control the second time I got pregnant (took the pill same time every single day), and still somehow managed to get pregnant. I realize maybe I've had lots of bad luck in this department or I am a freak of nature, but it can happen to anyone. So, don't be too judgmental. I was once in your shoes.  Karma bit me, hard.


And for the religious folk out there telling me God is telling me something by allowing sperm to travel up and make a baby: I don't know. The thing is, I'm more worried about my current circumstances and personal choice. Let God be mad at me but save yourselves the time and let your God do the judging himself.

Anyway here are the experiences:


**Abortion 1:** When I found out pregnant, I was really scared and most of all confused. I found out at about five weeks. It took me two weeks of confusion, crying, research, and even hate to come to the decision that I would proceed with the abortion. I'm not really going t go into detail as to why I chose it, but it was the best thing I could have done at the time.  I was unfit to be a mother (still am) and my boyfriend struggling making ends meet. 

I went online and read about the abortion pill. I thought it would be easy. Many women posted their experiences and many of those stated the abortion pill was more comfortable. They went on to say that the cramps were only similar to period cramps. That they somehow felt stronger enduring what they did and that the procedure was more private.  Cool. Decision made.

I get to the abortion clinic to be greeted by pro-life protesters telling me how they could help me and my partner. It affected me badly. I went inside and was surrounded by all sorts of different women. I was uneasy and confused. Right before I was set up to get the pill, I said I had changed my mind. I walked out to cry (while protesters were shouting at us) and a mother of a girl said some things that made me feel better about the situation. She told me to talk to my mother and father.  I went home and did exactly that. 

Next week I was back, did the whole wait for three hours thing, and finally saw the doctor. I was given a pill there and one to take home, along with antibiotics. I went home. I felt very nauseous and ended up puking at a Taco Bell.  This pill stopped the pregnancy hormone and essentially ""killed"" the ""baby.""

The second pill was to be taken 24 hours later along with Vicodin. I took the Vicodin first, had a heat pad in hand, and took my second pill.  I felt the cramps come on. They were intense but not too bad. I started to fall asleep and used the heat pad. Not too bad, I thought.

Thirty minutes later, I started to feel the most intense cramps I have ever experienced (I have had two kidney stones, so I am highly tolerant of pain) but this was so much. I got on all fours, vomited several times, and screamed. I started having contractions and my mother had to come over to try to help. I was covered in sweat. This lasted about 1.5 hours until my contractions reached 10-15 seconds apart...I started to bleed heavily and well...the pain subsided.

I bled for five weeks  non-stop. There was also a very unpleasant odor associated with the discharge. Almost a rotting smell. It was horrible.


**Abortion 2:** Found out about five weeks in, again. I was in disbelief and to be frank, numb. I honestly had no connection with this pregnancy like I did with the first. I felt no confusion. I felt no remorse. I felt nothing.  At that point, it became obvious to me I am probably never going to be fit for motherhood. I would be a selfish and bad mother. My lack of emotion made clear to both my partner and I to go for abortion number two.

I opted for the 'surgical' procedure this time. Showed up at the place and had the whole routine thing of counseling, the ultrasound, blood work, and whatnot. Finally get to the room and they had me remove my pants, lie back, and well, have my IV administered. It was 'twilight' sedation, so no general anesthesia. I was very afraid of this but the nurse told me to take a few breaths and a few seconds later...I was out.

I woke up sitting in the recovery area. I don't remember much. It was a real blur. I don't know who carried me. I don't know if I walked there. I then remember being walked to the car. I got home, showered, and passed out for six hours.

Very mild cramps and bleeding afterward. 



Well, I hope this helps at least one person. I'm just leaving this right here for you to decide what is best for you. I honestly hope no one comments about how I helped or whatever. Just do what you need to do and don't let others bring you down. Only you know how you feel. 

Even if I eventually regret what I did, life is about learning from mistakes. I don't feel as if I have made a mistake at any point. I had sex, used protection, and decided what was best for me. I have always and will continue to view good mothers as people I admire. My mother was and is an excellent role model and strong woman.  Even though she did not agree with my choices she loved and will continue to love me. I would have had some huge shoes to fill and well, unfortunately I am not cut out for it.  Good luck to you.

**EDIT**: 

Well, I did not expect the response that I got from this. While some of you have to make yourselves feel better about your lives by messaging me and calling me a whore, slut, or murderer--I just hope the children you accidentally/intentionally have/will have are more intelligent than you are.  For the record, I have only had one partner for five years. I suppose being happy in a relationship and having an active sex life is a bad thing. I do hope  for happiness and fulfillment in your lives. I hope you become more compassionate, thoughtful, and caring individuals. While words do not have much of an impact on me--I hope you realize that maybe one day your words can hurt someone. If you feel good about yourself doing that, I suggest you seek mental help or counseling...for your own sake.

Furthermore, I would also like to encourage for people to see if there are alternatives  to Planned Parenthood. I think Planned Parenthood is great. However, I chose a different clinic because they offered the sedation at the same price and it was much smaller--therefore less people and protestors.  So, please look up alternative clinics and do not be afraid to ask specific questions.

A lot of you seem to be in favor of adoption. I did go into detail as to why that was not the option for me.  So, yes. I have heard of ""adoption"" despite some of you thinking this was some strange word in the English language.  

However, I really just wanted to say that thank you to those that did constructively add to the discussion. I have received a lot of kind comments and heartfelt messages and I wish I could respond to them all. I thank you, men and women, for having also shared your experiences. I hope the best for you. If you are struggling: do not be afraid to reach out. Vent on the internet, go to a counselor, talk to a parent, read other people's stories so you know you aren't alone. 

I hope you all have a wonderful night.

--------------------------------------------

I grew up in almost every area you could find a Marine Corps or Navy base, Honolulu, Philadelphia, San Diego you name it; I've been there for at least a month. When my father was finally deployed to Afghanistan my mother and I moved back to her home town of Hueytown, AL to live with my grandparents. My mom, being a college drop out, worked most nights as a server while my grandmother entertained me. Life was different but for me it was all I knew. My dad eventually returned and retired so I thought my life would be normal but nearly 11 years later I find myself living in a world of constant fear and embarrassment far from the normalcy that most children cherished.

We'll call my mom Joan for anonymity.

Joan had a nasty habit of alcoholism, she drank till she was buzzed nearly every night. When my paternal grandfather would watch me my mother would stay out till 3 or 4 in the morning while he awaited her arrival so he could go home. Joan would arrive smelling like her nights festivities and after changing she would simply tell my grandfather,""You can leave now.""

This behavior never changed, especially after the divorce. Joan would often leave me at home with no food or way to get any when I was only 10, not answering her phone or messaging me for days on end. She would even throw extravagant parties which she told me I was not allowed to attend. I would be forced upstairs and not allowed to come down for any reason except to clean her mess or let the dog outside.
As I got older, my mothers antics became more severe. She would tell me I was worthless, that I would never accomplish anything, no one would ever want to marry me and that I would end up on the street. I often ignored the comments, parents sometimes say things they couldn't possibly mean, right? 
The problem with verbal volatility towards anyone is that they develop a fight or flight reaction if you do it enough, similar to being bullied. You either fight for yourself or run, and I chose wrong.
I began fighting back, telling her she never even finished college so who was she to tell me I was a failure? She failed classes in middle school and I was an all A student. The comments turned to screaming, the screaming became frantic and frantic emotions lead to frantic actions. I showed up to school covered in bruises, being a sporty child everyone just assumed it was just a rough soccer game or I fell in dance. My dad ignored them, he told me she was my mother and the comments were just ""who she was.""
I remember when she pushed me down the stairs, she stood above me, *laughing*. Warm tears rolled down my face, it was just who she was.

When I was 12 my dad took me to see a psychologist, we'll call her Anne. Anne was a specialist in child psychology, dealing with children of divorced parents. I saw Anne every 2 weeks for several years, but it wasn't until our 5th session that Anne asked me a question that changed my life forever.
Tears welled in my eyes in horror, even now I can't type the words without feeling them run down my face. Anne asked me if I had ever heard of child abuse or knew what it was.
At that moment I realized, everyone knew *except me*.

I was a victim of abuse and the only one who didn't know it.

Ever since I left her when I was 13 I've had dance teachers,  old friends, ex-friends of my mother and even my own dad tell me they saw how she treated me. But why didn't I? I was so concerned with keeping my life as normal as possible that I ignored every comment, every hit and every lonely night. More importantly, why did everyone ignore it too?
Why did my maternal grandparents gloss over my concerns for her behavior, why did my dad ignore them as well? Why did my own school counselor call Child Services because she thought I was suicidal but never decided to investigate my horrible relationships with female teachers? Or my fear of being touched?

I still don't know... and it haunts me.

Now, nearly 20 years old, my friends call me a survivor of childhood abuse, but I'm not sure if you can call this surviving. Any time a female authority figure yells at me, I have to get up and leave immediately. I burst into tears, which is extremely uncharacteristic of me, I shake and struggle to breathe. I hear the echoes of Joan, telling me to shut up, to stop crying for attention. Sometimes I hear them in my dreams and wake up to my roommate or my boyfriend giving me my medicine to calm me down.
Sometimes I smell her perfume, hear her favorite song or see someone with her poorly permed hair. My heart stops, for a second I'm back in my room, my mother pounding on my door and screaming to let her in, I'm just as scared and useless until a friend asks me what's wrong.

I shake my head, smile and tell a joke.
Because that's all I can do.

Sometimes I hop on Facebook and unblock Joan, see what she's doing. Usually the same thing, going to football games, partying, vacationing with money she doesn't have.
Things my father and I can't afford to do.
I wonder if she regrets anything that happened, I wonder if she even knows what she did.
I'll never know, more importantly I don't want to. But what I do know is this entire ordeal set off a passion in me that no other sport, subject or speech ever has.

Choosing a major in college was easy, I knew I wanted to help people like myself, if at least to help them with the after math. Psychology was my top scoring job on any personality test I took in school but I had already decided it was my calling. I decided I would bring awareness, before I left my High School, I worked to help women and children of domestic abuse, I set up several peer counseling groups as well as a club for people who wanted to help. I educated teachers in my school on the signs of child abuse and how to help children without breaking any laws or stepping on any toes. I left knowing I made that school a bit safer for people like me then when I came.
I hope that I can continue this into a long and healthy career as a Psychologist specializing in PTSD, depression and anxiety disorders while raising my own children in the best possible environment, giving them everything I never had; a real mother who only cares for them, a woman who exerts authority in her tone, not her insults and a parent who uplifts her children rather than dragging them down.

I hope to show people the one of the many faces behind childhood abuse, to make feel them a bit less alone.
Most importantly I hope to be a role model to other girls, and even other women, of the strength behind the suffering and the bright future past the dark present.

Guy sprinted after me in the dark to “just ask a question”,"I was walking home at 5:30, but because of the season it’s already pitch black when I leave work. Close to my apartment, a guy on a bike I’ve seen the past few days asked how I was. So I politely responded, “Good. You?” And kept walking. Then he yelled, “You’re beautiful!”

I picked up my speed, turned the corner and a minute later heard footsteps behind me. I took this opportunity to cross the road because there weren’t any cars. Imagine my surprise when I see the same guy, without his bike (no idea where the hell he ditched it) FULL ON SPRINTING TOWARDS ME DOWN THE SIDEWALK! He was about fifty feet from me so I stopped under a street light, held my hands up and said, “Stop running at me, you’re freaking me out.” 

He said, “I just wanted to ask you a question.”

I responded, “I don’t care, leave me alone, I’m going home.” 

Of course then he did the whole, “Damn, stupid bitch.” 

Thankfully he didn’t follow me. I feel lucky that I found a place to work so close to me, but god do I hate walking in the dark. And for the record, I was wearing mom jeans, a long sleeve shirt, and I was covered in sweat and snot because I’m a preschool teacher. Men will harass you no matter what.

ETA: for the next few days (at least) my mom will be driving me home.

My Parent's Church Tried To Publicly Shame Me For Having An Abortion,"I was 30 years old, teaching, not making a lot of money, paying rent for a TINY home. Had to leave my job when covid started, my school was going to open full-time in September 2020 and with a sick father, I was nervous to take that risk. I found some private tutoring jobs and was just barely surviving the pandemic financially.

December I lost my appetite and figured I wasn't handling my stress well. I deal with depression and anxiety and there were some other things I was going through since September. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating, and it felt like I had a stomach ulcer. Not having insurance, I tried everything to handle my stress and health at home. This lasted until January when I started feeling nauseous and throwing up.

**I hate to admit it but I had NO IDEA I was pregnant.** I was faithfully taking birth control and my SO is a nurse... so we're very educated in that area (haha). I've dealt with ulcers in the past and figured that's what it was. Pregnancy was NOT on my radar at all.

January 20th I checked myself into the ER. I was starting to miss work I desperately needed because I was throwing up - and with COVID still being a new thing families were uncomfortable with me in their house. And I was scared, I didn't know what was going on and everything I was doing wasn't helping and things were getting worse.

A few hours later in the hospital after blood tests and a rehydrating iv the nurses told me **I was 5-6 weeks pregnant.** (I'm in NJ, thankfully not in TEXAS... but that's another issue. Women deserve the choice over their bodies.. .not government or men.) **5-6 weeks and I thought I had an ulcer.**

I WAS FLOORED. shocked. stunned. speechless. I called my SO and my first words were, ""I can't have a baby now, I can't go through with this pregnancy."" They supported my decision.

I panicked and told my parents, and looking back I wish I had never told them. I was going through shock of finding out why I had been so sick these past months, and an abortion was something I never thought I'd have to do. I am pro choice, but I never lived in a way where I was throwing caution to the wind. It was shocking news. I told my parents I was pregnant and I was choosing not to follow through with the pregnancy.

They said that wasn't an option and went to their church (I stopped going to this church 3 years ago) and told the Elders. **6 men, all 40 yrs and above, with wives, and children.** I was locked in fear. I knew what I needed to do, but pressure from my parents, some friends and family, and now the church had me feeling stuck in cement that just kept pouring down on me.

One of the Elders (who has 2 daughters of his own) came to talk to me. Said that there were other options like adoption. I said that I understood that but had no finances, was not in a good state of health mentally or physically to be pregnant, and I did not want to carry to full term, I didn't want to be pregnant, I didn't want a baby, I didn't want adoption and a child growing up wondering why their mom didn't want them. I'm a teacher, I see these stories, hear them from my students, experience them everyday.

They told me to read my bible and remember that even though this is a ""desperately sad"", ""hopeless"" situation, and that ""sometimes god's discipline hurts"", that god works with our sin to show his greatness. I've never felt so unheard in my life. That feeling is crippling. I battled with these pressures, to the point of almost killing myself. I called the clinic crying and told them I needed to come in.

**\*I went. It saved my life. The nurses and staff were amazing and the first care I had felt in weeks. I felt cared for. I felt heard. They were gentle. They let me talk and** ***they listened.*** **They didn't try to pressure me out of it or say what they thought was the best decision for me. I woke up from the procedure and for the first time I felt like I could breathe. I left the clinic, opened the doors and felt sunshine for the first time in weeks. I just cried in my SO arms... but this time it wasn't sadness, or anxiety, or frustration, or anger. It was joy to still be alive. It was a breath of new life, relief. I can't express these feelings strong enough. I woke up and the hundreds of pounds of cement on my chest, heart, and mind were gone and there was the warm sun waiting for me. I will never forget that day.\***

My parents knew about the appointment. (Financial reasons and a few others, I was in the process of moving in) They called the church. In the waiting room at the clinic I received texts from some of them saying that it wasn't to late to change my mind. A few days after the appointment, an elder came to the house, while my parents had friends over for a get-together in the backyard, and told them that they (The Elders) were going to enact church discipline on me by telling the congregation what I had done.

ALSO - because of covid, the church was meeting outside on the side lawn of their property. Every Sunday they set up speakers and a small stage to hold their service, in a small neighborhood. The church sits in the middle of a neighborhood block - 2 sides of that block has apartment buildings directly across the street. the other sides have neighboring houses. ***This means that when they'd be announcing MY PERSONAL and MEDICAL business, they'd be doing it out in public over a microphone and set of stage speakers, IN THE MIDDLE OF A NEIGHBORHOOD.***

Thankfully enough, my parents felt this wasn't the best course of action and asked the Elders to not follow through with this plan, that it was not the way to go, that it would cause more harm, and this was no way to ""bring me back to Jesus"".  **The Elder said he understood and that nothing would be said about the situation, YET DIDN'T RELAY THAT MESSAGE TO THE OTHER ELDERS, which he said was a ""mistake"" on his part.**

At the service that weekend, THAT MY PARENTS DIDN'T ATTEND, they didn't give names but announced that the church was dealing with a difficult situation and needed prayer and support. Some people at the church who knew about the situation texted my parents what happened. My parents felt betrayed that any info was given - which is ironic because *I had asked them multiple times to stop telling people my business and that it was my story to tell, but they didn't understand that. They still don't after all of this sh\*t.*

I stand behind my decision 100%. It was not easy to make, but ALL women should have a choice over their bodies and their lives. It is not up to parents, a husband, a SO, a pastor, elder, or the government. I'm hurt by my parents and some friends and family who don't understand my decision... but it's my decision and I will clap for myself if I have to.

It makes me sad and not trusting of the church - how was that the way to care for someone? These men with their own families and children thinking that airing my hard decision would bring me to church or to Jesus. It hurts my heart that this is what the church did. It hurts my heart that this is what some states in our country are doing.

I will never forget the feeling of shock at finding out I was pregnant.

I will never forget the feeling of betrayal that instead of listening to me, my parents went to the church instead.

I will never forget the feeling of being silenced in what I wanted for my life. Being silenced when I was screaming that I was suffocating. Silenced to the point where I thought of taking my own life.

But...

I will never forget the breath I took after waking up. I will never forget feeling the sunshine as I walked out of the clinic. I'll never forget falling into my SO arms that day and crying with joy that I was alive again. I will never forget the pride I have for choosing myself... not my parents, not the church.

Daygaming: How NOT to approach women,"Daygaming is a ""dating strategy"" in which a man approaches a woman outside of a social setting, often aiming to catch her alone, and force into conversation, with the goal of getting her number.

Right off the bat. This is *not* a dating strategy, it is harassment, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Following a woman to an empty store aisle, to her car, or to a street corner, and making romantic/sexual advances on her is harassment.

Reasons why daygaming is awful:

1. There's a reason why non-social settings aren't social, because in those places, people have shit to do and places to be. Nobody needs their day interrupted someone trying to get in their pants. People go to social settings to be social, and non-social setting to not be social. Why would you ever break that??
2. Following *any* woman *anywhere* for *any* reason without her consent is stalking. Stalking is a crime, and if she notices, she will be not be in the mood to talk to you, that's for fucking sure. Women have been stalked and kidnapped in broad daylight before, and they cannot know your intentions. It's a terrible way to kick off a conversation, and, again, illegal.
3. I cannot think of a single woman who would enjoy being approached by a random guy while alone! Women do not enjoy feeling trapped, whether you're physically cornering them, refusing to cease conversation, or not respecting personal space. Again, there are women who have been kidnapped off the streets, and almost every woman has met a weirdo that definitely would have added to that statistic if given the chance.

A good motto for men dating is this: if you wouldn't want a guy twice your size doing it to you in prison, don't do it to a woman in the street. Women don't know your intentions, or who you are, or what you've done, but most are aware that you could physically overpower them if you wanted, and it's better to be safe than sorry.

Dont buy into any ""alpha"" male's advice! They don't know what they're talking about, and they probably just want your money. 

Women, please, is you know of any man in your life that does this, let them know that it's not okay! The name sounds innocent but it's nothing short of harrasment.

**Edit so people will stop commenting the same shit:** yes, you can talk to someone outside of a social setting. No, asking someone out during the day isn't the same as daygaming.

If you're both naturally in a non-social setting, you talk to her without following her around the store or to her car, and you're open to rejection, then you're not dayming.

""Hello, I just saw you here and thought you looked nice. Would you want to grab a coffee with me sometime?""

""No thank you, I'm not interested. Have a good day.""

""Okay, have a good day.""

That's just interaction. It's quick, lets both people go on with their day, and there's no stalking or harassment involved. As opposed to daygaming, when you go to a non-social place specifically to find someone's number, you follow that person around, follow them until they're alone or cornered, and then you try to get their number until you either get it or they escape. ""Would you want to get a coffee with me sometime,"" isn't the same as

""Lemme get your number""

""No"" 

"" Lemme get your number""

""No""

And let me restate number 2. Clearly some of yall have never been followed bc yall don't know what it means. Just happening to walk in the same direction as someone, or coincidentally ending up in same aisles as someone in a store is not following, and that's not what I mean. Following someone means regardless of where you go, even if you start taking a really weird path, they'll be there, some x distance behind, usually just standing there trying to act like they don't notice you, sometimes staring at you. If you're in a building and you go to the bathroom, they'll wait around for you to come out. Sometimes they'll be x distance in front, too, some PUAs reccomend always being in the line of sight of someone so you can justify your creepy behavior with some eye contact or something. Catching up with someone because they dropped something isn't following, approaching them right after you decide you want to ask them out isn't following.

**Edit 2 cause I forgot to include this in the 1st one:** When I said that following a woman anywhere for any reason is stalking, your laws may vary! Turns out, a lot of state laws vary, and I assume other countries' laws vary too. Lotta states say that stalking has to be a repeated to be considered stalking, so I'm wrong about that stalking thing depending where you live. Is it still rude and creepy? Yes, but not stalking, it turns out. Thank u/RazekDPP for pointing that out to me, bc I was just going by the DOJ definition.",TwoXChromosomes,1453,1622071842.0,300,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/nlugo5/daygaming_how_not_to_approach_women/
That was NOT sweet or romantic,"Can we talk about inappropriate behaviour for a second? This isn’t a ‘not all men’ post. I KNOW not all men do this, I want to know why the men that do, do it. 

I work with a guy who has a wicked crush on me and claims he’s in love with me. I’ve turned him down repeatedly. He’s pushy and doesn’t take a hint, but he’s actually a really good coworker (not sure if that’s because he wants to impress me or he’s actually good idk) so I just turn him down and move on. However, last night after my shift, it’s dark, late and I’m alone in my car leaving work. This car starts following me through town. It met me leaving work so he was waiting for me. He followed me until I left town (I live a town over) and then messaged me and was like ‘I was following you, hahaha’.

...... in WHAT world is that romantic or sweet or harmless? It’s creepy as fuck and as a woman who’s had unfortunate circumstances I was weirded out and super uncomfortable. I know this guy is clueless and doesn’t have a back bone but HOW do you reach that point that doing something like seems okay??? I don’t get it. Can someone please explain how?

Men Trauma-Dumping Doesn't Mean They Care About You.,"This is a reoccurring lesson for me and my girl-friends. Remembering this has saved me from diving in, hopeful and starry-eyed, for a man who actually didn't feel anything for me at all. 

As women, we don't all open up easily. There's the face of pleasantries and light-heartedness that we keep up. We're agreeable and kind to avoid scaring-off new people by being too bare too soon. This is because we aren't automatically granted respect for just existing, it has to be worked-for. I don't have a trust that anyone will care or listen to how I truly feel besides my long-term friends. Women have to constantly prove ourselves 'worthy' to men and other women.

But men only worry about earning respect from other men. They don't feel they have to fight for yours. They don't even notice when they earn it (we do). Men do not have to actually like you to feel comfortable confiding trauma in you. They will do it regardless. They are taught to see us as caretakers. For a lot of women, the emotional intimacy door is wide-open. They may not like you at all, but they’ll use you in place of their male friends for your heart. Because, blatantly, they don't have to worry about embarrassing themselves in front of someone they don't respect.
It’s NOT about you. In that moment, any feelings they have are their own grief, fear, sadness, self-doubt, whatever. NOT love for you, NOT care for you. Remember this. As bleak as it is. Men will not care for you because you are there for them. They will care for you when you abandon them (...and that's a topic for another day).

My friends and I have seen time and time again, heartbreak, because we felt so close to a man. They confided in us, they were honest and heartfelt with us, they bore their soul and begged us to be there for them when they needed someone. And we always were. And we took that to mean we were special. DON'T fall for it, don't run to your girls gushing about the breakthrough you had last night with the man you've only been seeing for 3 months. As fast as things started for them is how fast they can change. Love yourself.

I know, personally, delulu-land is a short walk. Making the trip is often subconscious. But knowing this helps. Being able to say ""I knew it!"" instead of ""But I thought!"" is empowering. And you're always stronger next time &lt;3",TwoXChromosomes,1579,1711936567.0,100,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bsrmkv/men_traumadumping_doesnt_mean_they_care_about_you/
Can we talk about how the Utah Police failed Gabby Petito?,"For those who aren't up to speed, Gabby Petito went on a road trip with her fiance Brian to Utah. During the road trip they argued and a third party observed it and called 911 because they were worried. Police responded and the officer said the two were just ""arguing"", clearly in love and that Gabby seemed to be having ""mental health break"" because she was crying uncontrollably.

Later, a second officer pulled over Brian who was speeding and Brian fails to pull over and eventually swerves and hits a curb.  After the van pulled over, Gabby was crying uncontrollably. The officer suspected that ~~Gabby~~ **Brian** was battered given the discrepancy in her and Brian's story and the scratches on ~~her arms~~ **his face**. The officer split them up over night but didn't file any charges.

**She stayed in the van bc the vehicle is registered to her. In the police cam at time mark 3:38, she talks about how he locked her out of the** [van.](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=218)

**Brian** [explains](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=319) **that she was trying to get her phone and the keys away from him, but he admits to taking the keys from her and telling her ""let's just calm down"" but doesn't explain why she was getting her phone or why he was preventing this. Was she trying to call someone or record what he was doing? If they were both holding the phone and he suddenly let go it could have swung up and hit his face.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Brian admits to speeding and cops glibly** [**ask if Gabby w**](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=364)**as to blame for him speeding as well.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Gabby says he grabbed her** [**face.**](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=540)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cops talk saying the witness saw** [Brian lock her out of the van](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=1258) **and Gabby tried to climb in through the driver door over Brian to get into the van after Brian hung her things on the back door of the van.**

&amp;#x200B;

Then Gabby went missing in Wyoming. Brian returned to Florida without her driving her van. After her parents filed a missing person report, Brian refused to cooperate with police and got a lawyer.

&amp;#x200B;

As a utah native, I am intimately aware of the DEEP seated misogyny in Utah and how that sexism impacts women, gaslights and neglects them.

I am reminded of Lauren McCluskey was violently murdered by her ex-boyfriend Melvin Rowland at the University of Utah on Oct. 22, 2018. She and her family had expressed concern about Melvin. Lauren reported Melvin was stalking and extorting her with naked photos but police didn't handle the case correctly. The Utah police not only FAILED her but also shared naked photos of her with their coworkers after her death. WHAT THE HOLY HELL. THEY SHARED HER NAKED PHOTOS THAT THEY KEPT STASHED ON THEIR FUCKING PHONE.

&amp;#x200B;

Something needs to be done. UTAH police needs to be defunded, restructured and re-educated. HOW MANY WOMEN NEED TO DIE BEFORE THEY CHANGE?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: Please note no one is saying Gabby didn't lash out violently. She also had hit him several times as well after he threatened to leave her stranded alone in Moab without any resources (her phone and other items were in the van). When he was telling her to walk away it was so he could leave without her. Keep in mind, the van is** **HERS,** **not his. Yet he drove it all the way back to Florida??? Why did he fly home and then fly back to drive the van back?**

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT2: updated with corrected information based on police body cam**

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 3: Here is a screen shot of the police report saying Gabby struck Brian AFTER she thought he was going to abandon her in Moab. 

Per the police report:

&gt;Brian said Gabrielle, thinking he was going to leave her in Moab without a ride went to slap him. As Gabrielle started to swing, Brian pushed her away to avoid the slap. As a result Gabrielle off balance, but still caught Brian’s face with some fingers causing some minor scratches

I surprised my BF with my hyper awareness during our night walk,"So yesterday we went to the movies and because Avatar 2 is so freaking long, we ended up finishing the movie after midnight.

The theater is close to our home, like 20 min walk and because I was with my BF (tall guy ex-rugby player) I felt safe. 

While we were walking, there was a girl in front of us who was taking the same route as us. I noticed how the girl was nervous (always looking ""behind us"", walking faster, etc) so I guided my boyfriend to take a different route. 

My BF was confused and I said: ""that girl with the brown jacket was nervous because of us, let's take this route instead"".

My BF blinked confused and followed up with a: ""wait, there was a girl with a brown jacket in front of us??""

I laughed and kept going our way, then when we needed to cross the street, I noticed a car parked on the other side with the door wide open and a man with a cellphone talking on the driver seat.

I NOPED instantly and guided my boyfriend to take an alternative route and he was once again confused. When I explained the guy in the car thing, he looked back and saw him. 

""Well damn, I didn't even notice,"" he told me impressed, ""are you always this aware on the street?""

""Well I have to"" 

""Why?""

""Because I'm a woman and you never know who's watching you at night"". 

I could tell my boyfriend got worried and told me he was sorry I have to experience this kind of nervousness all the time. I thanked him and then tried to light up the mood saying:

""Don't worry, with you by my side I don't have random guys following me so thank you !""

I think I scared him even more. I know this story is random but it's really telling how out experiences at night differ so much.

Sharing a power move,"To be clear, this is something I witnessed, and will be emulating in the future. Maybe you all will appreciate this.

The other night I was commuting home pretty late in the evening. When I got off the train it was basically me and just a couple other people, and as I walked home I was maybe a half a block behind another lone woman, maybe mid-twenties, on the other side of the street, nobody else around at all. 

I saw she was approaching a group of maybe 5 or 6 loud, boisterous teenagers coming the other way, taking up the entire sidewalk. 
Now this is a big city, so you never know what you're going to encounter with unsupervised teens out late at night. This woman was either going to have to step into the street to avoid the oncoming group or squeeze up against a fence. 

She did neither. As they approached near, she stopped and planted both feet, head up, and waited. 

The teens parted around her like she was a streetlamp and continued on their way, and then so did she. 

I wanted to applaud! It was the most baller move I think I've ever seen. She just silently stood her ground instead of giving up her space. It was powerful. 

I hope this inspires someone else as it did me.

"I went to a soup kitchen because I needed help. A man stared at me the entire time, followed me out, and spit at me. I don’t feel safe going back.","This was only my second time ever visiting a local meal assistance center. It's Masbia of Brooklyn which is such an incredible, amazing concept, and executed so well. I went in because I’m going through a really hard time financially and physically right now as I appeal my full disability denial. I couldn't work anymore after my total hysterectomy, anastrozole, and heart problems. I just needed a hot meal. Just an hour of peace and dignity.

But instead, I noticed a man sitting nearby who stared at me nonstop the entire time I was eating. No blinking, no looking away. Just watching. I tried to ignore it, tried to tell myself I was imagining things, tried to keep my head down and finish my food.

But as soon as I left, I heard someone behind me. It was him. He had followed me out. And he started spitting at me from behind. It was loud and deliberate. He didn’t say anything. Just this constant aggressive spitting sound, getting closer.

I kept walking as fast as I could without running, heart pounding, trying to figure out if I should turn or confront or scream. But I didn’t. I was able to shake him by going to the train station and blending into the evening rush crowd there. I was jumpy and shaky the rest of the way back home.

What terrifies me the most isn’t just what happened — it’s that I now feel like I can’t go back. That one of the very few places I could go for help is no longer safe because a man decided to make it unsafe.

And even worse, I’m scared to tell anyone who runs it. I don’t want to be labeled as a problem. I don’t want to risk being banned or blacklisted or seen as dramatic. I’m just a woman trying to survive right now. And apparently, even that's too much to ask.

Why is it that men can access these same resources — and still make women feel unsafe while doing so? Why are we expected to tolerate this just to eat?

I just needed a meal. That’s all.

A man’s reaction to my walking home at night,"Yesterday, I was walking home at around 1 am. It’s a twenty minute walk and although nothing has ever happened to me during said walk, I’ve unfortunately experienced a fair share of SA to warrant being fairly paranoid and careful. 

For most part, I was completely alone. That is, until I noticed a man behind me at around the half distance mark. I looked back at him a few times to assess the situation and sped up as a precaution - and you know what he did? 

He crossed the street to the other side. He saw how uncomfortable I was and reacted to it. It wasn’t his responsibility to accommodate my fear - but he did so anyway. It’s a small gesture but it meant SO much to me, it meant that I didn’t have to be on high alert for the rest of my journey home and worry about being attacked/followed. 

I know he was probably uncomfortable when he noticed my reaction to him. I mean, he was probably just trying to get home, too. That’s why I’m all the more grateful for how he handled the situation. That is all.",TwoXChromosomes,2223,1663419523.0,123,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xglulz/a_mans_reaction_to_my_walking_home_at_night/
I think someone was trying to kidnap me the other day,"I went to my favorite park to walk for exercise. I've always felt safe there. It's big and open, it has a petting zoo and a playground, and there are always other people there also walking for exercise, walking their dogs, playing with their kids, ect. It's just always had a good vibe until Monday (1/22).   


The area where I walk has the play ground, the petting zoo, and a pavilion with picnic tables, each with their own small parking lots. I was walking in the area between the pavilion and the petting zoo and I noticed a car drive by me going really slow and I could clearly see the man inside staring at me as he drove past. We passed each other and when he got to a spot where the road splits, he turned around and pulled into the entrance to the parking lot by the pavilion and just sat there with his car facing me. He wasn't even in a parking spot, he was literally sitting in the middle of the entrance. I immediately felt like something was up. I veered off to a path that goes closer to the pavilion so I would be further from the street.     


I stood there pretending to look at my phone, but was discreetly watching him for a few minutes and he kept sitting there. After about five minutes of this, I thought, okay, I need to get back to my car because this doesn't feel right. I pulled my pepper spray out of my purse and had it at the ready as I turned back toward my car and after I got a little ways ahead, he pulled out of the parking lot and drove ahead of me, again going really slow, and pulled into the parking lot by the petting zoo with his car straddling three parking spaces so that he was facing the parking lot by the playground where I was parked. I started walking as fast as I could without running at this point because the sidewalk was a bit icy.   


I got back to my car and got in and locked the doors sat there for at least ten minutes, watching him. (In hindsight, I should have just left right then, I know, but now that I was locked in and safer than I was out in the open, I wanted to see what this creep was going to do.)   


He kept sitting there watching me, too, until finally he pulled out and drove past me. I thought he was leaving, but when he got to the far entrance of the parking lot, he pulled in and parked right next to me. Bear in mind that there was only one other car in this lot and there were at least a dozen empty spaces. I cranked my car immediately and I saw him roll down his window and it looked like he was yelling something. I didn't want to stick around and find out what he was saying after he had followed me twice. I threw it in reverse and sped away. As I was pulling around behind his car, he opened his door and started to get out, but quickly got back in his car and started chasing me. I was driving as fast as I safely could on the winding road that led out of the park. I knew not to go straight home and let him see where I lived, but we haven't lived in this city for very long and I didn't know where the police station was (I was trying too hard not to have an accident with this creep chasing me to look up the address on my GPS while I was driving), so when I got to the intersection at the entrance, I turned the opposite direction I would normally take to go home, and he kept following me. I weaved around a couple of cars in front of me to get some distance between us and made a right turn onto a side street and just kept making random turns until I lost him. Then I made my way back home.  


I was absolutely shaking. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. After my boyfriend got home from work and I had had a chance to calm down a bit, we called the police and filed a report. I had had the foresight to snap not one, but two pictures of his license plate, front and back, while he was parked and watching me the first time and after he had moved when I was on my way back to my car.   


I didn't sleep well that night and I didn't leave the apartment the next day. I'm feeling a bit better now, but I can't stop thinking, What was his plan? What was he going to do? Was he out specifically looking for someone to grab, or was he driving through the park and saw me and that's when he decided to start acting creepy? I'm also so upset because that's my favorite park and I love walking there and now I don't feel comfortable going back, at least for a while, because what if he drives through again while I'm there and recognizes me (I'm easy to spot because I have pink hair) and starts acting even more aggressive? I just needed a place to share this and vent because I knew all of you would understand.

This is how you compliment people in public.,"I know, within the feminist community, there is a lot of debate about where's the line to be crossed when it comes to being ""complimented"" by strangers in public or work settings. 


I know a lot feminists that think that no place or time is appropriate to be complimented by a stranger, while I understand this is an opinion and I respect that... I have to disagree. 


While I was grocering shopping this old man between 50-60's walked up to me and said: 


""Excuse me, miss... Sorry to interrupting you, just wanted to say that you look lovely today and I hope you have a wonderful day.""


This caught me pretty off guard and I probably looked very confused. 


He then said: 


""I really hope I didn't disturbed you out or something, it's just that over the years I've learned that we all need to hear at least something nice everyday and I hope this isn't the last nice thing you hear today..."" 


I said: 


""Oh no, thank you so much... Have a great day yourself!""


He nodded and left. 


Now, see... This is how you approach people and tell them something nice! I didn't feel abused nor objectified and he also had a great point, everyone should hear at least one good thing per day because honestly coming from a place where you struggle with self-love, this little old man just made my whole day. 


This is how you do it! You shouldn't shout on the street, you shouldn't whistle nor honk your car... You shouldn't follow someone and intimidate them... You shouldn't say stuff like: ""hey nice butt!"" ""hey nice rack!"" ""hey sexy!"" ""hey have sex with me!"" or something along those lines that are very inappropriate and awkward as fuck. 


Okay, this rant-ish post is over, thank you for reading.




**EDIT:** Woah, front page... Nice. 


**EDIT2:** Not going to answer everyone but I understand that the number one thing people are asking is:

- Would you have reacted the same way if it was a guy your age? **YES**.

- Would you have reacted the same way if it was a ""shaddy looking guy""? **YES**. 

As long as the person was just being polite, then yes. It still would have made my day. 

And no, you don't need to say ""two long phrases"" to be considered polite... A simple, ""Hello, you look nice today!"" is polite as well. 

I hope that clears everything up. 

**EDIT3:** For everyone claiming that what the man said to me was harassment, you're the ones who are fucked up for trivializing something serious as harassment.

**EDIT4:** Some of you guys, jfc, really need to work on your social skills... We are humans, social creatures. 
If you don't want to talk or don't want people coming up to you on the street with just the intention of making conversation with you, then that's fine... When did I say it wasn't? Do you also need some reading comprehension classes? Don't lash on me, I'm just sharing a random act of kindness that happened to me, the fact that most of the people giving me shit for this are women... It's pretty heartbreaking.

UPDATE: Guy sprinted after me in the dark to “just ask a question”,"Hopefully this is the last interaction I ever have with this man. Check post history for context. 

TLDR:

I walk to work. When I get off it’s super dark out. One day coming home, random guy tries to talk to me and I ignore him. He ends up running down the street after me to “just ask a question”. 

So, the UPDATE: 

I’ve gotten my mom to drive me home after work since the incident with Creepy Guy. I’ve been carrying my big umbrella with me in the morning to use as a potential weapon until I can go buy pepper spray. 

Friday morning I’m walking to work when I pass a trailer. Two people are standing on the porch talking, which isn’t unusual. There’s usually random people at this particular house, women and men. I live in the South, so hearing a random “how ya doing?” isn’t uncommon. 

The man on the porch says just that. I barely glanced over, so I had no idea that it was actually Creepy Guy. I said “Good.” and nothing else. 

The woman says something like “stop it, be quiet.” And that’s when I looked up and realized who it was. 

Creepy Guy then says, “I hope you have a good day at work!” Which just set me off. I was already thinking of saying something when he added, “Do you have a boyfriend?” 

I turned around, pointed right at him, and yelled, “I told you last time to leave me alone! You’re making me extremely uncomfortable. Do not ever speak to me again.” 

The woman next to him nodded at me and said, “Good for you.” 

As I kept walking I thought about all the things I wish I had said. How I’m too scared to walk at night now because he was the straw that broke the camels back. How I plan on using my money to buy pepper spray instead of the phone charger I’ve been needing, all because he doesn’t know how to read the fucking room. 

Overall, I recognize my luck that he didn’t turn particularly aggressive or violent either time. And I’m glad that woman was there. I have no idea how they know each other, maybe he lives in the trailer park and they’re neighbors. They didn’t look or act related, but either way I hope that moment slapped some sense into him.",TwoXChromosomes,1738,1705208755.0,90,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/196801w/update_guy_sprinted_after_me_in_the_dark_to_just/
Really strange encounter at the gym,"I (24F) don’t usually feel inclined to post but for some reason this had me pretty rattled and I felt compelled to share it. I was at the gym finishing up my workout when an elderly woman approached me. She didn’t speak English super well but she was talking about needing help setting up her laptop because her kids live far away and the airline lost her old one when she last traveled overseas. I initially felt bad and asked if she had it with her so I could take a look and she said no but that she lived 5 mins away and that I could come over after the gym. I declined but said if she brought her laptop to the gym the next day someone could probably help her. She continued to insist that I help her and that her house would be the best way because she had an office, and asked what time I could go over/when I’m usually at the gym so she could meet me and have me go over. She said a few times “she lived alone so I didn’t need to worry” and “knew someone young like me would be able to help”. I continued to politely decline and she finally walked away but not before asking my age and telling me I was pretty. I ride a motorcycle so my helmet was on the floor next to me while we spoke - she pointed this out as well. I left just a few minutes later and was walking to my bike I noticed a large white van parked near my motorcycle and immediately felt super uneasy. I waited for more people to be around before approaching my bike to leave because at this point it was dark I was thoroughly freaked out. As I was starting up my bike the vans cabin lights turned on as if a door was opened and in a panic I left as fast as I could, neglecting to put on gloves and turn on music like I normally would. I went to the store before I went home, checking to make sure I wasn’t being followed by anyone. I’ve never really had anything like this happen to me but I know there’s a lot of weird schemes behind human trafficking and my gut was screaming at me that something about the entire thing was very off. While it could have all been nothing but a sweet old lady and a weird coincidence with the van I just wanted to post this in a place where others would understand how scary even seemingly innocent exchanges can feel when you know there are people out there with full intention of doing harm. On the off chance this was some form of malicious setup, I remind everyone to please be careful out there, and pay attention even when your first instinct is to be kind to strangers.",TwoXChromosomes,1024,1710993268.0,133,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bjxj1q/really_strange_encounter_at_the_gym/
Always look over your shoulder when you enter your home.,"I want to share a story about something that happened to me because it can happen to any one of us. A few years ago, I got home from work and walked my dog before we settled in for the night. I live in the city, and I’m in a well-lit college apartment, where there are usually many people around at any time of the day. Most of the time, I’ve felt safe here.

Despite that, I am vigilant when it’s dark out. I’ve seen too many serial killer documentaries to be oblivious outside. It wasn’t super late, maybe 8 p.m. When Ohana (my dog) finished her business, we walked back to my apartment. I never left the apartment complex area. When I got close to my door, I saw a man on a bike across the street. He looked like your typical college guy, so I didn’t pay him much attention. He biked off and I walked to my door.

Ohana is a shiba inu, an incredibly smart, loyal, and stubborn breed. They’re small-ish dogs, weighing 20-25 lbs. Ohana sits at about 20lbs. I think this guy saw Ohana and thought she posed no threat. I went to unlock my apartment and Ohana went berserk, snarling, howling, legit trying to yank off of her leash. She is not an aggressive dog and I have never seen her act like this towards a human before or since this incident. She pulled on her leash so hard that it spun me around, a complete 180. The man was standing a few feet behind me, his hands tucked into his jacket pockets, concealing god knows what. He didn’t give me a “Hi, neighbor I just moved in” or “Sorry! I just wanted to know if I could pet your dog”. No, he runs off. 

I don’t know what that man planned on doing, but there was a 0% chance it was good, and my dog saved me from what was going to be a very very serious assault. So please ladies, look behind you before you enter your homes and if you can afford to care for a dog, get one. Mine probably saved my life.",TwoXChromosomes,2459,1699029739.0,67,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17mzafp/always_look_over_your_shoulder_when_you_enter/
Yesterday I told a cat-caller my salary.........,"This one's a doozy. I know it 100% sounds like a made up story but it actually happened. It was strangely satisfying so I hope you get a kick out of it too.

Context: I just spent a little over two months finding a new job. It was my first time ever switching jobs. There were a lot of ups and downs; it was very time consuming and emotionally draining and it was all I thought about. I had a target salary in mind, $45K over my prior role, which was one of many things I obsessed over for these several weeks. Earlier this month, I got and negotiated an offer for my target salary at a startup I'm really excited about! I'm proud of my hard work in the interviewing process and of my negotiation.

Here's the part that sounds fake but isn't!

Yesterday I was walking to the train station wearing my nice luxury sunglasses I bought to reward myself for the new job. Something about these sunglasses makes men rabid; I've been harassed more aggressively than ever.

This 40-something greasy dude was harassing me out his car window, following me down the street, offering a ride/marijuana/etc., no matter how much I ignored him or said ""no thanks."" Then he pulled up ahead and waited for me to walk by, stuck out his head obnoxiously and asked if I wanted a sugar daddy. I said ""no I'm good"" and kept walking. He was like, ""You sure? I could take care of you.""

That PISSED ME OFF. Some other asshole had used that same line last week in a similar situation. ""I cOuLd TaKe CaRe Of YoU"" as if I'm soooo helpless and dependent, when I'd actually just worked so hard to get a great job. Dude was dressed like shit btw and driving some generic car (I don't know cars), also he was a 45-year-old following and offering to smoke out a random woman, none of which screams high earner.

I judged that he wouldn't be able to follow me onto my train in the worst case scenario. I stopped, turned around, and said, ""Yeah? You think you make more than me?"" He got all flustered and said ""maybe..."" I told him I make 180K and he avoided eye contact and said ""I make about that much."" I laughed and was like, ""anyways I'm good!"" and booked it to the train station.

Absolutely ridiculous interaction but also kinda hilarious. He was being so condescending I had to turn it back on him and call his bluff.  I hope I emasculated him a little and that he has too much shame to use that dumbass line now.

I help a woman avoid a creep using a LPT I learned on this sub,"Friday night I was out with friends at a bar. We were sitting near the entrance when I hear some people yelling and looked around. The bartender and a regular patron were pushing a disgruntled guy out the front door. This guy was clearly impaired, high or drunk, and told the bartender he was going to come back and shoot them in the face. I was pretty stunned and I wanted to make sure this guy left the area so I went outside after him and hung around the few people smoking out front.

The guy talked a some shit as he walked away but appeared to be leaving. Maybe a hundred feet from the bar, he approached a woman who had just crossed the street. She didn't see or hear him causing a scene. He stopped her and started talking to her. I couldn't hear what he was saying but she didn't walk away and responded to him a few times so I'm assuming it was casual conversation.

After thirty seconds or so I felt like I should try to give her a way out so I walked over to them. I didn't know this woman at all. When I got to them I said ""Hey, Emily. Are you coming to the bar?""  She was a little confused as I doubt her name is Emily.
She said she wasn't going to the bar.

I responded with, ""Well why don't you hang out for a minute, all your friends are inside.""

That was all she needed to end her conversation with the creepy guy. She said Ok and walked with me toward the bar. She was going to her car, which happened to be right in front of the bar, so when we got to the entrance I told her how the guy was acting before, she said thank you and got in her car and left. 

Tldr; Drunk guy got thrown out of the bar. He proceeded to talk to a woman outside. I made up a fake name and told her that her friends were waiting for us inside. Creepy guy was successful avoided and everyone when home happy.",TwoXChromosomes,2788,1649102784.0,99,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/twbm0t/i_help_a_woman_avoid_a_creep_using_a_lpt_i/
I’m left scared and uneasy after a message from an old classmate,"Someone who I haven’t seen in over 15 years left me a message a few hours ago. The last time he did this was 5 years ago, and it was to tell me that ‘he was in love with me’ and I was the one who got away or some BS. 

I only ever knew him in middle school, I don’t even remember who I was back then or what sort of chaos was happening in my life at the time. But regardless, he doesn’t know me and I don’t know him. I’m a completely different person than I was even 5 years ago when he messaged me, let alone 15 when we actually saw each other in person. 

I tried to explain even a few years back he is being unrealistic, I am not who he thinks i am etc., but as I’m older now, I tried to convey to him in a different way that he is all in his head, in fantasy land, and that while it’s flattering to be a part of his fantasy world, that is not reality and he does not know me and hasn’t known me for quite a while. I tried to explain that he could hate who I am and vice versa, etc.

He sent me back a video of him just staring off in the distance and saying “I don’t know if you know this or not, but you were meant to be my future wife. I don’t know if you need to come to me, or I need to come to you, but something needs to happen,” and then he just stared off into the distance again for 5 more seconds.

I guess the words themselves aren’t super scary or anything, but the entire tone and vibe of the video sent chills down my spine, and I just feel kinda unsafe now.

I'm not sure if I’m being overdramatic or not, but I feel like I need to make sure I don’t walk alone anymore like after work and stuff? I'm almost too scared to block him too, as he knows where I work and I don't want to piss him off or make him try to see me in person? Ugh idk

EDIT: 

Thank you guys so much for your kind words and validations for the feelings I was and am currently going through. I am reading and rereading the advice you have given me very carefully and am trying to take each and every one into consideration before I make my next move. 

I've always been a 'go with your gut' type of person, and I've genuinely never had this type of scared feeling before. I've decided for sure I’m going to talk to the security at my job, as I am inclined to believe they will take this seriously.

So far I was dead set on not replying and blocking him by the end of the night, but I have read a few things that give me pause. The first being that it will make it easier to get a restraining order in the future if I, in plain english state that I want no further contact from him etc. Another few people have mentioned it might be good to keep him unblocked for evidence or even as a warning if he does escalate things. 
I promise I’m not trying to find a reason or excuse not to block him, as that is probably what will end up happening anyways, but some of those points do seem valid to me as well. 

It breaks my heart to hear others have or are currently going through this as well. I hope you guys stay safe, and thank you again for the different recommendations for defensive tools and The Birdie Alarm.",TwoXChromosomes,1350,1719774100.0,82,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ds8rvb/im_left_scared_and_uneasy_after_a_message_from_an/
Worst sex of my life trying to be a wingman for my friend,"This might be long but I really just have to get this off my chest. 

I’m currently studying abroad in Czech Republic and for the Thanksgiving holiday I decided to meet a college friend who is studying abroad in Italy. We met through the sorority we joined three years ago, and have been friends ever since. She’s a good friend, one of the handful of girls in the sorority that I actually enjoy. However, she’s always been a little selfish. For lack of a better word, she’s a little dumb, so I excuse her selfishness because of that. This time, though, I’m really hurt by it. 

My first night visiting we went to a bar and we starting making out with this pair of brothers. My dude was kinda cute in my opinion, but her’s was the cuter one. I was fine just making out with him, but I didn’t want to sleep with him. 

He walked me back to her apartment, and her and his brother were a little behind us. We kept making out and touching, but I was ready to go to bed. My friend and her man catch up to us at the door of the apartment and I tell her I’m tired. “You don’t wanna go back with him?” She said to me. I felt so awkward because he was standing right in front of me, so I just kept saying I was tired. She obviously wanted to bring her man back up to her apartment, kept ignoring the fact that I wasn’t really feeling like going back to the brother’s apartment, and just said “don’t worry, he’ll wake you up in the morning.”  So I went. 

At this point I’m like fine, I haven’t had sex in a while and he was attractive to me, so I guess I’ll have it. We get back to his apartment, smoke a joint, make out, and he pulls his pants down and it’s literally a micropenis. Maybe like 2-3 inches. I’m immediately turned off, but now I feel stuck. He puts a condom on, trying to tell me what to do and be hot, but I was so turned off. I didn’t feel safe to say no because it was his apartment and he was way too excited. The condom was huge on him, and while I was laying on my back, he had to let me know that it was inside. At one point he slipped out and literally started humping the crease between my thigh and my gut, thinking he was in me. I laid there miserable, and so I said how I was tired, hinting that I didn’t want to keep going. He looked me in the eyes and said “are you lying to me?” I was terrified. No.. no I said. He got up off me aggressively and went pack to finishing the joint. I sat there scared. Let me just act like this is fine I told myself, i genuinely didn’t feel like I could leave. I don’t know why. We had the lamest excuse for sex after that, him forgetting I said I was tired probably on purpose. Again, he was humping my thigh. I didn’t want him inside of me at all so I just sat there and pretending like he was doing the right thing. I practically ran out at 6am when my friend texted and asked when I was coming back. 

Next day, I tell her trying to make light out of it, a funny story, and she laughs of course which I don’t mind because I wanted to laugh about it.   Then, she goes onto tell me that she didn’t even have sex with her man, and then proceeds to make fun of how ugly my man was, telling her other roommates how I wanted to go back with him and how obsessed with him I was. I was embarrassed, and I got mad and snippy because I literally made it obvious that I didn’t want to go back with him. 

I’m ashamed, I’m disappointed that I couldn’t stick up for myself more, and she’s only making me feel worse. It’s been two days since and tomorrow I leave to go back to Prague so I kind of let it go now.  I want to have a good rest of time with her. She hasn’t mentioned it today, so I’m glad.  I just feel like shit about it, and it makes me upset that she spoke about it in the way that she did after and made fun of me. Needless to say, I’m excited to go back to Prague tomorrow and take care of myself, spend some time alone and recoup. Thanks for reading

EDIT: forgot to mention that he did eat me out, and it was good but he did it after finishing the joint in an effort to try to get me in the mood. Still, he ignored me saying I was tired. Head is head though, so I can’t complain. Everything besides that was an absolute nightmare though. 

EDIT 2: spoke with my friend about it. I was as mature as possible, and she responded honestly saying how she genuinely didn’t mean to be mean and she would never wanna make me feel that way. She apologized to me very sincerely. Thank you to everyone who told me to say something, it gave me the courage to say something and I feel better knowing she didn’t do that to me purposely.

I can’t stop thinking about this scenario - how badly did I mess up?,"I’ve lived alone in my apartment with my toddler son for 3 months now. We are always walking around the complex, and have gotten to know many neighbors and the maintenance men a bit. A few weeks back, the fact that my son’s birthday is coming up came up in conversation with one of the maintenance men (who also lives in the complex), I’ll call him Chris. Chris said he was going to get my son a present, but I honestly thought he was joking. I kind of politely laughed it off and moved on.  

Well today we see Chris, and he says his present for my son is in his car. Convo proceeds as follows:  
Chris: “I was going to bring it by the other night, but I wasn’t sure if your husband would get mad or whatever”.   
Me (IDIOT): “Well it’s just the two of us [gesturing to my son] so no worries!”  
I realized immediately after my mistake. My paranoia has me thinking about the fact he has keys to my place and such. I will say, he did bring the gift by a few minutes ago, and it was a fine interaction. This is my first time “living alone” (as the only adult), so not sure if I’m over thinking what was simply a nice gesture.

“I don’t know what to do…”,"“I seriously don’t know what to do…”

I was having a perfect day today. I rushed my makeup and forgot my falsies and setting spray, but I made it to work on time, absolutely killed it, and was let off early because it wasn’t busy and we were over staffed. 

I immediately went home and changed and glammed up my look, remembering my falsies and setting spray, and decided instead of bussing to the mall I would walk because the weather was fair, fair for April in northern Ontario. 

I finished buying groceries and hangers, and went to the bus stop. All of the stores in the mall were closing, so the bus stop was crowded. I stood near a bench and this man right away said “DAMN, I bet we’re going on the same bus?”

I ignored him and he began talking to me fishing for responses “you wouldn’t happen to be going to the [blah blah bar] would you?” and just being a huge creep. He was probably 40 but looked 60 from drugs or alcohol and dressed like he was 20 with missing teeth and and chains. I was carrying coat hangers and groceries, I sure as hell wasn’t trying to find a bar to go to on a nice Sunday.

I looked over in the bus shelter and noticed a lesbian couple, knew they were a couple because they kissed, so I escaped into there with them and ANOTHER CREEP CAME AFTER ME!!!

He cornered me in the shelter and started talking about my dreamcatcher earrings and how I can help him with his nightmares and asked if I believe in that stuff, and then started asking my name and making fun of me when I shyly answered him. I thought of the girls stuck deeper in the bus shelter and blocked the entire entrance with my body and groceries until he went away.

One of the ladies said right away “I was gonna say something if he kept harassing you!”

“I don’t know what to do!” I said in a whiny voice, and they both laughed at me.

“I seriously **don’t know what to do…**” I was about to cry and my old manly voice came out, and they realized right then and there that I’m transgender… and that I *seriously* didn’t know what to do…

“Ohhhh……..” was the only thing out of their mouth after hearing my real voice…

I feel so dirty. I was wearing a long puffy coat that almost touches my knees. I ran away from them. I just wanted to be alone, and I didn’t feel safe. I ran with all my groceries and didn’t even bother taking my shopping cart, and found a quiet bus stop far away from the mall and waited 30 minutes for the next bus. Alone. 

I don’t know what to do. I ignored them and they still harassed me. I walked away and I still got followed. I tried being respectful while clearly showing disinterest, and they still hit on me. I tried finding safety in numbers and felt like I endangered those poor ladies rather than protect myself - and who knows wether or not they were TERFs? 

I ran away, and instead of taking the bus all the way to the terminal and maybe running into one of them again scared me so much, I got off the bus 12 stops early and walked 20 minutes home avoiding downtown while lugging my heavy groceries during sunset. 

It was a perfect day until men ruined it. 

And I don’t know what to do when I’m alone in all of this.

Okay… Thanks for the downvotes I guess… (first 10 minutes lol)

Wow!! You ladies are amazing 🥲 I wish I could read all the comments and reply, but I’m on my break and have to hold my tears back! Thank you all so so much 💖✨

Okay, this isn’t my first rodeo on Reddit. Transphobes find these threads and downvote every comment. I’m reading every comment and if I disagreed with anything I would have said so. So for anyone coming back to check on this, just know I’m reading every single comment and I know we’re all here for nothing but love and support. Thank you all for being my big sisters! I was not expecting so much wisdom and power to be sent my in my direction and I want you all to know you helped.

Lastly, many of the comments are suggesting violence. I’m a devout pacifist, and today was not easy on my spirit. This has potential for a much deeper conversation, but I believe I might have to reconsider my stance on pacifism and it’s hard to think about it without crying…

I’ve made the mistake of chiming into an Ask thread (vent),"The thread is literally asking what’s the worst part about being a woman and I was chiming in on how much it sucks to always be on guard. I said that I envy men because I’d love to talk night walks but I can’t-it isn’t safe

A group of men screamed at me from their truck that I was a dumb bitch for wearing a face mask,"My family  ordered takeout the other night, and the restaurant was only like .3 miles away so I just went to walk and get it by myself because no one else wanted to. I wore a facemask and I was walking down the street by myself minding  my own business, it was really dark. All the sudden I heard a truck pull up behind me and then a man, in a really aggressive voice yelled at me:
 “I TOO LIKE TO WEAR FACEMASKS ALL ALONE” 

I live with my mom who has lupus which is why I’m being so careful- she can’t get covid, it would be bad. 

So I screamed back “My mother is immunocompromised you fucking asshole” but as soon as he heard the word immunocompromised he and all his friends started screaming “fuck you” and kept calling me a dumb bitch until they drove away. 

This happened in Northern Arizona and it really, really shook me up. Being screamed at by a group of men when you’re alone and it’s dark is scary enough, but what I don’t get is how they were so upset that a woman they don’t even know had a face mask on. Like why do they care? It wasn’t effecting them in any way, they just wanted to scare and intimidate me. It was so shitty, and this country is so divided it scares me.",TwoXChromosomes,1835,1591205428.0,191,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/gvyb8a/a_group_of_men_screamed_at_me_from_their_truck/
I finally reported my coworker for innaproptiate actions and comments.,"Update 2: he was let go! It was not for this situation but purely on work performance! I feel like such a weight is off my shoulders 

In my job, I have the opportunity to train new employees. My trainee this go around has done nothing but belittle me and make inappropriate comments and sexually explicit comments towards me. He has made comments about me being his next wife and chaining me up so I could never leave him. He has made jokes about there being no such thing as consent because everyone wants it (it was situationally relevant for the tasks we had that day). He blamed and yelled at me in front of clients for things he did wrong, introduced me as his secretary and told the clients I was only there for eye candy. (proven wrong when I had to step in because he was ROYALLY f-ing up.) 

After observing him today, I realized he doesn't know anything about the job! For whatever reason, that was the last straw for me and I went to my boss. Thankfully, my boss is a 0 tolerance type of guy and ratcheted it to his bosses and hr. My boss assured me it did the right thing and asked if I needed to be picked up (trainee and I carpooled and I wasn't with my car) or needed anything. 

I pride myself on being very open-minded, and I have brushed off several comments from other employees, but I truly believe this person is a walking lawsuit and I fear for the safety of any person, especially any woman, that would have to meet with him. 

As part of this process, I had to spend time transcribing every inappropriate comment, gesture, and feeling, but I DID IT!

I STOOD UP FOR MYSELF! The email has been sent to HR and after tomorrow I will likely never have to see this gross man again. 

On an unrelated note, while I was typing the email to HR, I got a call that my dog is terminal and will not make it very long, this was somewhat expected but hearing it from the vet was really rough. Today SUPER sucked but I stood up for myself and I can snuggle my sick puppy. I have already been approved time off for mental health. Thanks for reading my emotional rollercoaster of a day. Sorry for any grammar or spelling, I'm on mobile and f#*$#$ exhausted. Cheers. 

UPDATE: 

Oh my goodness this took off! Thank you all for the kind words, love, support and hugs you have sent. The Director of HR called me today (I work for a large company, so that was very nice) and the first thing she asked was if I was safe, and how am I emotionally feeling. I did see that individual today, but met him at the site and called out sick the rest of the day. HR and I both decided it would be unsafe for me to return and work with him especially because we work from home offices. His training was transferred to a male employee who also expressed his safety concerns, so they had to call a third person because no one wants to work with this guy. Everything has been officially reported, and it looks like he will not pass the training program (save the company from having to fire him.) I will NEVER have to see him again and I have been approved for ""mental/emotional health"" days. 

Regarding my puppy, she had blood tests today and they showed that her health is not declining as much as previously believed, but she still has about a year left with us. 

Three random wonderful things today (because it's easy to focus on the shitty)
-I was fixing my makeup in the car, and an elderly woman gave me a thumbs up and told me I am beautiful
-While I was talking to the trainee telling him I would be going home sick he got angry. At that minute, a coworker (I have never seen another coworker out in the field) walked out of the building and saw what was going on. The nice coworker insisted he had questions and would walk me to my car (he had no questions, just saw a bad situation and wanted to help).
-The man at chick fil a heard the end of my conversation with HR said, ""That did not sound like a good conversation, are you okay"" I responded yes and he told me, ""I am sorry people can be mean, but you are a wonderful person"" he had no context and no other knowledge. 

For ANYONE reading this going through the same situation, REPORT IT! This has happened to so many people based on comments and it is not acceptable, you are not alone.

To my jellybean I’m sorry I didn’t save you,"It’s been three years today that I lost you at the hands of a man whose name I will curse until my dying day.  He was not your father ,the man that sired you left a week before I knew you existed . for the  5  to 6 months that followed I would feverishly hope he would walk through the door and come back to me like he promised he would and make everything ok .  I did everything in my power to make sure you were healthy  and that you were loved .  I softy read the hobbit to you every night and the fae touched poetry of W.b Yates every morning  . Your nursery was a light grey with rainbows  I wanted your first years to be full of love and whimsy the things I never had at your age.  Your name was going to be winter I loved the snow. I loved you beyond  measure but I failed to protect you .   If you had a chance to draw breath would you of liked the things I had planned?  The animated don bluth films  I would of shown you  , the way  the sunlight filters through the trees on a summer day causing the lawn to look magical and the names of the stars and planets in the  in the vast dark sky . Would you have had your fathers sorrowful grey eyes ? My small nose? You even had books already  I knew you would of loved Clifford.  That day all I asked that man was what he wanted for lunch he snapped and I bled in the tub for eight hours  in a locked bathroom  until you arrived . Perfect  tiny and fragile as glass my son . I buried you in the garden  hot blood  still trickling down my legs  the man wanted you thrown away I needed you give peace . The air was heavy with humidity and wild mint . I didn’t name you winter and   I’m so sorry I couldn’t protect you. I named you after your father and placed a single dandelion on your grave .

"Male friend is ""chill"" and doesn't understand why I am not ""chill""","I have a good friend who I love. His wife is my best friend, I've been close with both of them for like fifteen years at this point.

He's the best, I know he means well....but I'm going to freak out if he makes one more comment about how tolerant he is and how INTOLERANT i am.

The context: I was riding my bike across the street today, and a man mowing his lawn across the street  made a point of stopping his mowing to stare at me for the full five seconds it took me to cross the street. It was so annoying I shouted ""STARING IS FUCKING RUDE"" and gave him the finger. The dudes in this town are absolutely the worst with their staring, it is disgusting and I hate it. I want to just RIDE MY BIKE like a MAN and be ignored by the world entirely.

I was so annoyed that when my friend messaged me ""hey hows it goin"" (v normal for our friendship to have regular check ins) I just told him about it. Totally enraged. He said he would have just ignored the man, and then went on to say ""***well I'm generally more chill than you I think***."" Unfortunately, this isn't the first time he's made a generalizing statement about our personalities based on shitty specific situations.

I snapped.

SIR. OF COURSE YOU WOULD IGNORE THIS DUDE. It would be weird and out of place for a man to stare you down in such a way. MEANWHILE, for me and for a TON Of women, this is a daily occurrence and we are fucking tired. I am sick of it. I am sick of men driving by me slowly when I walk on the sidewalk. Like 5 mph, just to force eye contact. I am sick of men in the cars next to me staring at me at stop lights, to the point where they don't notice the light has changed...because again, they are trying to force eye contact. I am sick of it. I am not being intolerant, I am justifiably FUCKING PISSED.

I'd also be very chill and tolerant if I was left alone all day every day. I'd be chill as fuck. BUT NO. I DO NOT HAVE THAT OPTION. I HAVE NOT BEEN LEFT ALONE IN PUBLIC SINCE I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD.

I have officially raised my friendship standards. I told him he could feel comfy in his tolerance all day long, but he was a fool to ignore the differences in men and women when it comes to ""tolerance"" of publicly harassing behavior. He didn't know how to respond and went silent. GOOD. THINK ABOUT IT AND GET BACK TO ME, BABE.

My girlfriend got assaulted right in front of me,"My (35f) girlfriend (32f) was groped whilst we were waiting for our Uber home last Friday night. It was around 1am and we were waiting at a bus stop in central London. This guy who had half an unlit cigarette hanging out of his mouth came up to us and first of all asked me if I had a lighter. I said no and he moved on to my gf who was standing next to me maybe a metre or two away and he asked her the same question to which she also replied no. I thought that was that. I live in London so I feel like I’m pretty used to the random, mostly innocuous encounters like these, especially late at night, and although we’ve had some unpleasant words thrown at us in the past from men who feel the need to comment about two women being together, these encounters generally do not phase me and I am fortunate that nothing seriously bad has ever happened. 

Anyway, we both had our phones out as we were trying to book an Uber/Bolt to see which one would arrive quickest so we were a bit distracted and obviously not giving this guy much attention. Instead of walking away after my gf replied no to his question about the lighter, he swung his arm out from underneath him and grabbed her crotch. 

In the moment she was stunned and basically just flinched and before she could do much else I threw myself at him and pushed him away shouting “what the fuck, fuck off” type stuff. He tried to grab me by the throat and I could see in his eyes and the way he was trying to position his body that he wanted to punch me but he didn’t. I was holding him by his shirt at the neck and just yanking and pushing him away, shouting at him. I was wearing a crossbody bag so my girlfriend grabbed on to the strap behind me and yanked me back so that I wouldn’t get in a full on physical altercation with this guy. 

He walked away and I turned around and checked on my gf who was just saying things like “stop trying to fight him it’s not worth it”. At this point I’m desperately hoping for our Uber driver to arrive and the guy fucking comes back and of course I go lunging at him again just telling him to fuck off but again my gf holds me back. He’s just shouting shit at us and eventually turns around and walks away.

Thankfully our Uber driver finally arrives and then it all suddenly hit and my gf starts crying. She cried the whole journey home and cried basically all night. I tried to comfort her but she would just physically push me away or tell me to leave her alone which was really tough and I didn’t know what to do or say. Eventually we were lying in bed and I just held her for a long time without saying anything whilst she was sobbing and eventually said “I just need you to tell me that I’m safe and that it’s not my fault” which of course I did and managed to say a few other thoughts about the situation but I just didn’t think I could say anything to fix the way she was feeling…

She asked me if I thought she was overreacting, and of course I said no, but I guess in the moment I didn’t quite realise the gravity of what this guy did. He basically sexually assaulted her. He committed a crime. And so publicly, just in the middle of the street with witnesses around, like it was absolutely nothing. It’s so gross and makes me feel so sick and so sad that this act was clearly so “normal” to this guy that he probably regularly attacks women and gets away with it every time. It’s just so unfair. 

Luckily my gf managed to get over the shock of it and we tried to not let it ruin our weekend. Obviously we are grateful it wasn’t anything worse but it was just a really shitty experience and it sucks feeling so helpless in a situation like that.

I just wanted to get this off my chest really. If anyone has experienced something similar  first of all I am so sorry and if you are comfortable sharing how you helped each other through it I would love to hear it because I wish I could have been more supportive in the moment towards her (instead of just violent and reactive towards him!) and found the right words to say to help her through it.

My Best Friend (F22) was SAd in a Gay Bar. Women Aren’t Safe Anywhere,"So with my friend’s permission, I wanted to anonymously share her story with you all. Because once again, she is left traumatized and enraged as many of us are and have been. 


I want to start by sharing some perhaps relevant details. She is very traditionally attractive, has long blonde hair and blue eyes, about 5’7 and 120lbs, relatively feminine presenting. Gets hit on by men 24/7 even though she’s an openly flaming lesbian in a LTR. And she unfortunately already has a lengthy history of prior sexual assaults. 



So a couple nights ago, she goes out with a few gay (cis male) friends to the only gay night club/bar in her urban, GA city. She gets up and starts dancing with her friends on the dance floor after a couple drinks together. They’re basically dancing in a circle and having a good time. Then eventually this guy shows up out of nowhere, and starts dancing in their circle with them. So it’s chill, and then her friends kind of start dancing together on their own. And this guy holds his hand out to her, and assuming he’s gay, she takes it, and she twirls him around her… like a friendly, gay, twink. But then he interlocks their fingers and starts pulling her into him, trying to place her hand on his shoulder and her other hand on his waist, and she pulls away from him. 



But his grip only got tighter, and he starts literally grinding on her. At that point she said stop, loudly, and pulled away again. But as he’s grinding on her, he reaches down, grabs her ass, and pulls her into him and then grabs her by the chin to look up at him. Then he leans down into her and guides her head, to make her kiss his neck. Then she says stop loudly again, and tries to free herself. She manages to face the other way looking for her friend, when he then grabs her from behind, starts humping her with his raging boner and pushes her back forward to bend her over. Then she catches sight of her friend and yells loudly at him to help her. He came running over and yanked her away from him, back the few steps to where they had started, and the guy ran off. 


She asked when they’d leave and her friend said “in a few” bc he was (drunk) busy making out with his partner. So she walked out of the bar the long way around, and the asshole guy bumps into her to thank her for the dance. She’s like “whatever” and he continues to follow her out of the bar. He goes “My name’s M what’s yours?” And she says “good for you” still walking away. At which point he left her alone, with his tail between his legs. 



Not even 9 months ago she was at a high end club with her girlfriend, walked away from her drink for all of two minutes to dance, came back for a sip, and was roofied. She started puking, passed out, and was taken to a hospital via ambulance when nobody could get her to wake up. Someone weird and sketchy was trying to pick her up from the hospital so she refused care, discharged herself, and went home. 





Even with therapy, a great gf, and a fantastic support network, she cannot live in a moment’s peace, go anywhere, do anything with anyone, without constant anxiety and paranoia that a man, ANY man, could and would try to do something to her. (As I’m sure many of us have felt far too many times.) She can’t go to a GAY male bar with GAY friends, without a man trying something. Because men EVERYWHERE are a THREAT. And NO woman is safe anywhere. End of rant. ",TwoXChromosomes,640,1710123017.0,188,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bbrz6b/my_best_friend_f22_was_sad_in_a_gay_bar_women/
No idea how to approach my daughter with a confusing sex discussion,"This happened last night, I'm still shaken by it and I'd like some advice from mothers and, perhaps, daughters as well.

I'm a single father and I have two daughters: 19 and 16.  My youngest is enrolled at an all girl's Catholic school in our city.  We aren't a religious family, she attends this school because it has a tennis team, while the local public school does not.  I had never thought about the effect going to an all girl's school might have on her, my eldest went to the same school and (as far as I know) had no issue with it.

I work long hours and I get home late most nights.  Because of this my daughter walks home from school with her male cousin every afternoon.  This isn't because I don't think she can't take care of herself, rather, my sister doesn't think her son can take care of himself (he's 14).

Yesterday, I wasn't feeling well and I decided to take the day off.  I was in my office when my daughter and her cousin came home.  I had headphones on and didn't hear them come in, but around 5 PM I decided to head into the kitchen to prepare dinner.

*I walked in on my daughter and my nephew performing oral sex upon one another.*  I shouted out, they both quickly got dressed, and I called my sister to come pick her son up.  I didn't know what to say to them and I definitely didn't know what to say to my sister, so I told them I had to think about things first and to not worry (for now).

I made dinner and we ate and my daughter filled me in on a few things (she volunteer the information, I did not ask):

* It was her idea, not his.  If anyone should get in trouble it should says it should be her.

* She has been wondering about sex for a while and, while I had given her the birds and the bees talk, she claims she feels left out because she goes to an all girl's school.

* This was, apparently, the first time and they're not interested in each other (""I don't have a crush on him"").  I got the feeling this was simply because he was the most easily-accessible male.

* She said she and her best friend (female) have done similar things with one another and that she doesn't think she is gay.

I don't mind the curiosity, I don't mind the experimentation either.  We're a very pro-LGBTQ family, etc. but **incest** is not something I thought I would have to deal with.

I do not have a wife to discuss this with and I don't want to ask my other daughter for advice.  I'm afraid to approach my sister with this information because she's much, much more conservative than I am.

I want to have a happy, healthy, discussion with my daughter and let her know I love her and will help her get whatever information she wants, but that cousin + cousin stuff is... traditionally not OK.  I don't want to scare her.

Help?

**Update #1:** OK, thank you for all of the wonderful replies.  I got home from work, read all of the replies, and sat down with my daughter.  First, we live in a state where age of consent is 16 and there are allowances for people close in age, so legally she is fine.  The website I visited to check described it as ""age of offender"" and ""age of victim/survivor"" which absolutely broke my heart.  Furthermore, while she instigated, I do not think he resisted because she showed me some texts on her phone where she asks beforehand and he agrees.  The original plan was to try this weekend, but my nephew/sister ended up going out of town instead.

Second, thank you thank you thank you to /u/Lil_Boots1 .  I explained the different types of relationships there are and how people may even shift between them (friend -&gt; romance -&gt; friend or even something less than a friend) and how there are certain boundaries that make certain relationships not possible or detrimental for certain groups of people (relatives, co-workers, etc.).  She reiterated that they were not ""into each other,"" but that she simply wanted to ""see what it was like.""  She has male friends that she routinely hangs out with, but, apparently, they all have girlfriends, are ""gross,"" or have some other factor that made them undesirable (?).

Third, we talked about school and she definitely wants to continue where she is.  My other daughter earned a tennis scholarship and she is actually the poorer player (between the two).  Money isn't exactly tight for us, but it would help me avoid a lot of student loans.  I don't think this is factoring in to her decision, she genuinely seems to like school and tennis for their own sake, not just because it might be a financial boon in a few years.

Fourth, I've decided to continue to let them hang out together.  I think cutting off contact would just be too weird for everyone involved and I do trust both of them still.  I haven't talked to my sister and nephew yet, so this might change if she feels differently, but I think cutting contact, or watching them them like a hawk, would send the wrong message.

Fifth, I've looked up some co-ed groups around town that she can join.  There is a tennis club, but it looks a bit too basic for her.  She also enjoys photography, but there doesn't seem to be anything for high school students (only college kids).  I told her she can do research and I'll let her join club or whatever she wants (within reason).

I'm going to shower and then drive over to my sister's place.  I'll try to update again afterwards, but thank you again for the wonderful suggestions.

**Update #2:** First of all, what is wrong with all the Redditors who are sending me private messages to ""kill [my]self"" or ""have [my] daughter practice on [me] instead""?  Please, take a look at your own lives and think about what would motivate you to say such things.

Second, my sister was quite understanding.  I think there were some misconceptions when I said my nephew couldn't take care of himself.  I meant he would eat nothing put chips/soda if he was left to his own devices.  Nothing more than that.  My daughter had texted my nephew while I was on my way over, so he knew I was coming.  My sister knew something was up, but didn't believe me at first.  I told her privately what had happened and she said ""Seriously?"" quite a few times.  She called my nephew into the room and asked him a few questions, the gist of the story was the same: my daughter had floated the idea with him about a week ago, he had agreed immediately (no coercion) and I caught them during the first and only act.

My sister didn't say much before sending him away again.  We had a small chat, she felt the same way I did: they're young, they're questioning things, etc.  She has apparently caught him looking at pornography a few times.  In a weird way, she seemed relieved it wasn't with ""some stranger.""  She agrees cutting off contact would be a stupid idea and end up making family gatherings needlessly uncomfortable.

Lastly, a few people have asked where ""the mother"" is.  She died of breast cancer almost 10 years ago.  Someone mentioned sex toys being a healthy way to experiment and I like that idea, so I'm going to go the gift card route and let her choose on her own.  I don't want to know any more about that then I have to.

Thank you again.  I never thought any of this would ""end bad"" or ""blow up"" or whatever.  I just wanted to make sure I continued in the best way possible and I think things are OK for now.  I don't know if/how my sister will handle things with her son, but that is her business not mine.

"My Neighbor’s Daughter Died [CW: transphobia, loss of a child, suicide]","CW: Transphobia, loss of a child, suicide

I have lurked here for a long time, I hope this is the right place to share. I hope that by sharing, others like me who are usually silent will be persuaded to be more vocal in their support of trans youth. I have removed identifying details because this story is my experience largely as a bystander to another family’s tragedy.

My neighbor Sue (not her name) moved in across the street about a year ago. Sue moved in first, did some fixing up, then her daughter came to join her a few weeks later.  Sue is a nice middle-aged lady, very practical, handy around the house and yard. We chatted when she first arrived; she mentioned moving so that her daughter could attend the local school, better than in their previous area. I never formally met the daughter but I saw her around the neighborhood. She made a friend in the cul de sac and was forever walking back and forth with the friend, another high school girl. They both dyed their hair bright colors and generally seemed like the kind of offbeat, cool girls I would’ve liked to know in high school. But I’m a 35 year-old mom with brown hair, so not much in common there. I mostly made small talk with Sue about our gardens when my family took our evening walks.

My bedroom window faces the side of Sue’s house and her daughter’s bedroom window. Each night when I went to close my curtains, I could see across to the daughter’s window, blinds usually open and a big pink and blue pride flag visible on the wall opposite the window. She’s trans. 

I admire trans people, especially trans women. It’s not easy anywhere, for sure, but this is a small suburb in a red state, a state that is doing its best to legislate trans folk out of existence. I’m not certain I would have what it takes to live that truth here. And as a teen, forget it. So I think highly of Sue’s daughter, walking the sidewalks in her long pink hair and cute cardi and jeans. I’ve never talked to this child, but we are neighbors and she seems like a cool kid.

Two nights ago, I was putting my youngest to bed when we heard sirens outside. I’m getting texts from my mom friend across the street. Something’s going on. She thinks it’s the sketchy dudes two houses down that maybe sell drugs. I look out my bedroom window. There’s a fire truck, ambulance, several cop cars. The whole cavalry. But the paramedics run into Sue’s house. I can just make out figures moving around in her daughter’s room. Oh, this is a terrible feeling. I text Sue, say I just hope everyone’s okay, we’re here if you need anything. I immediately regret texting her while there’s obviously a crisis ongoing, but I’m also quietly hoping to hear about a faulty security alarm, a prank, even a mild heart attack, please, anything but the only explanation loudly ringing in my head.

Sue replied some time later. Her daughter died. I learn only now, in this text conversation, that her daughter’s name is Taryn. I learn the next day, in a tearful driveway exchange with Sue, that Taryn had been struggling for two years prior. I did everything I possibly could for her, she tells me. Sue was walking to the cul de sac to knock on the door of Taryn’s friend, who I learn is named Cath. To give Cath’s mom the awful news and tell her to look out for her daughter.

Taryn died on the spring equinox, on a beautiful full moon, on the day where the light finally starts to outweigh the darkness. Or at least that’s what is promised.

When I close the curtains now, no pink and blue flag. No light on in the room. No best friends passing by on the sidewalk.  

I got a flag for our house. I’m not someone who is comfortable making big public displays of opinion. I don’t even have any bumper stickers. I had to research and figure out the right flag to get. The one that says hey neighbors, we stand with all the people these colors represent, and it’s a whole bunch of goddamn colors and fuck you if you don’t because it’s my house and my flag and my neighborhood too. If Taryn were still alive she would have seen it. It would have been unmissable on her walks with Cath. I will see it every day and wish it had always been up. It took a terrible thing going down right in my front yard to make me buy a stupid flag, and that’s my problem and it’s not all better because of the flag. I’m so sad for Sue and for Cath and for Taryn and all the people who loved her. I’m so ashamed to have been silent when there was a chance to speak up as a neighbor and an adult and a parent and a woman with many kinds of privilege. I’m so sorry, Taryn.",TwoXChromosomes,2219,1647746329.0,103,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/tic00x/my_neighbors_daughter_died_cw_transphobia_loss_of/
Being a woman is fucking scary sometimes.,"I really just need to write this to vent as i just had a massive panic attack. For reference, i live with a male roommate. 

I feel like i shouldn’t even have to be writing this out right now but here i am. I was laying in bed and i hear my doorbell go off. It was in the evening and i’m not expecting anyone so i assumed it was maybe my landlord, apartment maintenance or something. I look through the peep-hole, and no one was there. 

I thought to myself “Huh, maybe my landlord left a note in the door because he thought we weren’t home?”

I open my door and i see a man, probably 6’3 and in his mid to late 20’s leaning on the side of the house out of view from the peep hole. I’m 21, 5’2 and 130lbs I immediately got chills. He asks “Do you have a charger?” in a really monotone voice. I don’t know this man, he’s not any of my neighbors and i just got really scared. He looked me up and down. I told him i would check and see with a smile. I shut my door and lock it right after that.

I run to my roommates room, and snatch his headset off and tell him what’s going on. My hands are shaking and i feel like i’m going to throw up. I don’t know why i reacted this way, but i did. He gets up and looks through the peep hole, now the man is standing in front of it with a hood on. I’m literally pacing back and forth wondering what to do. Why would he come to a second story apartment to ask for a phone charger? 


I grab a broken one with a cube, hand it to my roommate and tell him to give it to him, but about 5 minutes of contemplating this and he left. 

I don’t know. I’m just really shaken up by this. Not to mention- i’m an online creator so the possibilities that come along with that are fucking scary. I came to a realization that i can’t live alone. I don’t know what i would’ve done if i was.


edit- wow holy shit i didn’t expect this to get so many upvotes :’) i have a very much needed therapy appointment tomorrow so this will be perfect to let out my anxiety surrounding the whole thing. also, i hate reading that so many of you have had similar experiences. i’ve been on edge all night and it’s been hard to sleep. thank you guys for validating my concerns, and if you’ve been through this before then your concerns and fears are valid too. stay safe

I told my SO I was molested as a child. Then she told me she was also molested. Now she's thinking about leaving me. I need perspective please.,"throwaway, sorry. I hope you understand. Wall of text ahead. Proceed at own risk.

I told my girlfriend of 4 years I was molested as a small boy. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I just couldn't keep it in any longer and, I don't know, I just wanted someone besides myself to tell me it was going to be okay.

For the longest, I had suppressed these thoughts/memories. I thought my life would fall apart if I ever let myself think about them. I thought it was my fault. Something I did. It was someone who I thought cared about me. So that scared me. And it was by a man (my uncle) and the very thought of questioning my sexuality terrified me as well.

So I forgot them, at least I thought I did. I knew there was some deep sadness in me and it would creep out sometimes but I honestly couldn't remember why and I never cared to. I just thought I was one of those people who were just prone to bouts of depression. A couple days in the dark all alone, not leaving my bed except to pee, and it would pass. It always did.


So now I'm 22 years old. My life is moving upwards. For the first time in my life, I am confident about my future. A couple months ago I started to have these thoughts; thoughts turned to memories; memories into nightmares. Everything came back to me. After years of pushing it into the farthest parts of my mind, it became all I could think about. I knew I had to talk to someone but what happened to me as a child left me with ridiculous trust issues. Self-esteem issues that I never really understood.


My gf is the kindest person I've ever met. She comes from a stable family (as opposed to the dysfunctional hand of a family I was dealt). She had both parents and they were educated as well. She never could handle stress well but that's where I came in. I always, except on very rare occasions, gave the aura of a calm person. Someone who could be relied upon. And so we worked well together. I thought I could tell her this dark secret because she made me feel safe.


One night, we were at my house and getting ready for sex. I very much enjoy the build up, the foreplay. Sorry for the overshare but it's waaaay too late to worry about that. Anyways, something happened that I'm still not sure of, but I stopped. She asked me what was wrong... and then I told her everything. 

I always imagined I'd get very emotional telling this story to someone. Like in the movies. But other than a couple pregnant pauses on my part, there was nothing. I was never really good at opening up. She on the other hand was crying before I even finished. I held her. After a little while, she looked up at me and told me her story. She was molested. Also by her uncle (fucking uncles amiright??). She was about 7 years old I think. The thought of my girlfriend as a small innocent child being...I don't think I've ever cried harder in my life. We held each other. Everything was gonna be okay.


Or so I thought. A month went by and everything was good. We never really expanded on our confessions but it never came up. We were always so happy around each other. And we were both fairly busy. Her with college/part-time work and me working full time (I start college in January), that we tended to savor our moments together. We didn't want to spend them crying.

Now, I mentioned how she was bad at handling stress earlier. She had recently moved out, so she had to take more hours at work. She was also struggling with a class at school. So I didn't want to tell her how I felt a little distance between us recently. We were seeing even less of each other and I didn't want to add to her stress by asking for a little more personal time.


A couple days ago, we had a conversation on the phone that was kind of intense. At this point, it had been about a week and a half since I'd seen her. I met up with her before she started work and asked her what was wrong. She basically told me that every time she looked at me, she thought of what happened to her. That the last night we spent a night together (about a week before that), she would keep waking and get scared of the man in her bed and have to remind herself it was me. She said it was not okay that she wasn't able to sleep next to me. I tried to tell her it wasn't her fault. That it was okay. I tried to tell her that even after we confessed to each other, we had spent nights together and we would always end up oversleeping. With all of the stress of her life and ""her problems with men"" and school and work, she wondered if it was healthy for her to be in a relationship.


I could barely believe what I was hearing. I had showed her the most vulnerable part of me and I had it blow up in my face. I posted this here because I think I need the perspective of a woman but actually I just need someone to relate to. Thank you so much for listening.


Tl;dr: Me and SO both been diddled. Tears were had. Now everythings fucked up and I regret all of it.


EDIT: I can't believe this many people give a fuck. Even if it is an internet fuck. I'm reading through everything and, with each comment, I'm gaining perspective that I would have never had before. I am truly grateful. ",TwoXChromosomes,1188,1417347059.0,531,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2nu6et/i_told_my_so_i_was_molested_as_a_child_then_she/
My (26F) boyfriend (28F) mock strangled me. Is is just poor humour or is this guy dangerous?,"Whilst I was camping alone with my boyfriend, he had a few hours of low mood from lowering his antidepressant meds. For context, he knows I was preoccupied with my personal safety whilst camping. When he arrived I told him I felt safer now I was with a male. The first night I spent with a female friend only.

 I was scrolling on my phone when he approached me from behind and mock strangled me without  pressure. Then sat down and brought up a Louis CK comedy skit about how the number one threat to women is men, and going on a date with them is 'rolling the dice'. His bought this skit up many times.  So the conversation turned to women being murdered. 

As the convo went on, I said he'd make a good schoolteacher. He said no, because 'I'm a killer' and then immediately panicked at his word slip up, that's not what he meant to say.

He also doesn't want kids as his greatest worry is if the child dies, then the government would investigate if he was at fault.


His personality has been green flags. His not controlling, he takes responsibility for his actions, his humble, cares for animals and is trusting of me. He is childish in his hobbies and is into dark humour. The only pink flag is he playfully restrains me at times when I try to leave bed, one time he threw something at my face (not angrily) and another time he pushed me off the bed for shits and giggles. A friend doing this wouldn't scare me, but because he is a man/partner it makes me worried for potential  abuse.


I don't know if having the heebie-jeebies is warranted? I just think respectable men would not simulate abuse on their partner even as a joke. I'm unsettled to think he did it because part of him got something out of it.

 Could this guy be a monster deep, deep down or is it thoughtless humour?

"""it probably made you feel good, though""","I was talking to my dad about walking my dog around the apartment complex the other night, and some guy whistled at me from his garage. I ignored him. He stepped out a little more, and loudly whistled again. One of those weet-woo whistles. 

I ended up just pulling on the leash, and steering my dog away. He didn't follow me or anything. But it was late/dark, and it made me uncomfortable. 

As I was telling my dad this story, he laughed and said, ""But it probably made you feel good, right?""

No. No, it did not. I have been working 60 hour work weeks. When I get home, I am exhausted. I don't want to talk to people, let alone get whistled at by them. It doesn't make me feel good to feel like I'm being looked over and judged-- approval or not. I just want to walk my dog. 
Not even including the fact that I immediately started worrying that he would keep following me.

I was being followed and called the police.,"Walking home from the grocery store. A man came up to me without a mask and I put my hand up to sat Im not interested and keep walking. He sayings stuff like “give me a chance” and “wow a real escape artist”. He is persistent in following me a few blocks, so I enter the first store I could find. I told the clerk that the man outside was following me and Ive been waiting for him to leave. She recommended that I contact 911. I called the police and they asked me to identify the individual. A hotel manager across the street  saw the police care and came over and said they kicked the man out this morning for a ‘mental health crisis’ and he has been wandering the area ever since. The police asked if he was threatening and I said no but he made me feel unsafe. I told them I didn’t feel comfortable walking outside and they drove me home. Then they drove back to talk to the man.

If ANYONE makes you feel uncomfortable, speak up and get help.

18F Dog Walker Feeling Unsafe Around Male Client—Need Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m an 18-year-old dog walker/sitter and run my own business. I have a male client in his mid/late 60s who I’ve walked for about 4 months, Monday–Friday.

When we first met, he seemed nice, but early on he made a few comments about my body, my boyfriend, and sexual things from his past. He also kissed my cheeks. At the time I didn’t feel like boundaries were crossed professionally.

A month after he became my client, he started making small sexual comments. After a video I accidentally sent showed my face for a split second, he began messaging me every 30 minutes on multiple platforms, calling me sexy, saying he adored my face, suggesting I wanted to kiss him. I asked him to stop and said it was inappropriate and made me uncomfortable. He said he would stop, but apologized only for how I felt, not his actions.

He stopped for about a week, but then in person he said things like “I can’t help it, you’re sexy” and continued for 10 minutes. He’s often supposed to be out of the house, but started being home more, without telling me. Recently, he: •	Commented he was jealous of his dog rubbing on my upper thigh •	Grabbed my hand and stared at me intensely •	Told me he had a dream where I hurt myself and I asked him to kiss it better, and said it was my fault he had the dream

I love his dog and the money is good, but I am genuinely scared every time I walk him. I’m not sure what to do—I don’t want to lose the dog, but I also don’t feel safe.

Am I overreacting? Should I end the client relationship? How would you handle this?


Update: Thank you so much for everyone’s replies, they’ve really helped me see things clearly. I’ll be stopping this client as of now.

For those suggesting I report to the police, what exactly would I say? I know I’d explain the events, but part of me feels like if I just end things, I won’t see him again. The thing that worries me is that he does have my address (from invoices), and I’d also need to avoid my usual walking woods since that’s where he lives. I think if I bumped into him again after ending things, he might try to hurt me to be completely honest",TwoXChromosomes,258,1755793995.0,109,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mwfylt/18f_dog_walker_feeling_unsafe_around_male/
I am reclaiming pigtails ... from porn.  ,"When I was a kid, I used to wear pigtails/plaits all the time.  However, until recently I couldn't wear them without imagining myself in some kind of ""naughty schoolgirl"" uniform, bent over a desk, being begrudging rodgered by a man twice my age.  I couldn't think of pigtails without thinking of porno.

On the rare occasion I left the house with them in, I always experienced a bizzarre rise in harassment.  Everything from the innocuous 'nice pigtails love' to strangers hitting on me.  When I wore them to work my boss made a crass 'while you're down there' joke.  Wholly depressing.

But I am RECLAIMING THESE BABIES, damnit.  I love pigtails.  They keep my hair out of my face and I think they are cute.  I am not going to let fear of harassment or porno-association deter me from wearing them.  FUCK YOU PORN FOR STEALING MY HAIR STYLE.

Who's with me??! *punches air*

In celebration, [I took a picture.](http://imgur.com/HKAAG)

FO REAL THO - does anyone else find it they get more harassment/attention when they wear piggies?


EDIT : as someone pointed out, I prolly shouldnt be putting 'strangers hitting on me' automatically in the bracket of street harassment. However, sadly, 98% of incidents where strangers have 'hit on me' it's usually in a way that I feel constitute harassment; following me, making rude or aggressive comments, touching me, repeatedly trying to talk to me after I've politely declined their offer and sometimes blocking my way. That stuff. The 2% of incidents where guys have got it right (I.e talked to me like a fellow human being, maybe dropped a compliment or two and politely asked for my number), I've almost felt like applauding them. I've never given my number in that situation because I've never wanted to, but I am usually flattered and don't feel unsafe. So apologies for generalising.

Also, thank you so much for all the compliments (mental!) and sharing of your experiences. Great to hear both the positive and the negative - especially the more serious ones which really highlight the subtle lengths some ladies go to to avoid harassment and negative attention from others. This was my first proper post on TwoX (I usually just hang around in the comments endless regurgitating rape statistics), and you've made me feel super welcome and glad to be surrounded by a community of lovely men and women.

A man intentionally scared me on the way to work,"I was heading to work this morning. It’s 5:30 in the morning, it’s dark, and I’m at the transit center heading for the train. I was rushing trying to catch the next train so I was walking pretty quickly. I crossed the street and there was a man walking on the far sidewalk. As I get to the other side he stops right in front of me, turns to face me and says “why are you walking up on me like that?!” 

Now this guy isn’t much bigger than me. I’m average lady height, so he wasn’t very tall and wasn’t very muscular. But where I live there’s a problem with people and drugs. The kind of drugs that can make people do and say crazy things. So even though he wasn’t physically much bigger than me, he scared the hell out of me. He sounded so aggressive and serious like he really thought I was trying to sneak up on him or something. I’m a little ashamed to say it but I froze. My fight/flight/fawn trauma response kicked in and I just froze and said to him “I’m not!”

He repeated “why are you coming up on me like that?!” And sounded even more aggressive. I managed to squeak out “I’m just heading for the train!”

He stared at me for a second and then BUSTS OUT LAUGHING and says “I’m just kidding. You have a nice day” and continues on his way laughing. And my fawn response continued and I automatically gave a laugh in response and said “you too” and then hustled off to the train. 

He HAD to know why he was doing. I’m a woman, alone, in the dark, and he pulled that shit? He scared me so bad. I thought he was going to turn around and get physical with me. But no. He just wanted to scare me for a laugh. and now I’m on the train and away from him and I’m pissed. 

Oh and also he made me miss the train I was trying to catch by like 2 seconds. It locked as I tried to open the doors and left. So screw that guy

Huge shout out to those who look out for vulnerable strangers,"I work in a nightclub as a doorman. I was approached last night by 2 women who were concerned for a 3rd woman who seemed to be on her own. They said she was very drunk and there was a man taking advantage of the situation - kept touching her.

I asked to him leave and I assisted the woman. Two things quickly became apparent. She was on her own and she was totally out of it. There was no way I was going to leave her alone to wander off into the night so I walked with her out of the club to the street volunteers down the road (they have a safe shelter and help ensure people get home safely.) 

As I was walking her over the road, I began to believe that there was a possibility of her having had her drink spiked. 

There are always police around the shelter so I spoke to them about my concerns and was able to point out the man walking away. They immediately followed and one way or another, he is now known to them and our door staff.

Thank you to those 2 women who came to speak to me and to the wonderful volunteers who are out every weekend in all weather.

I really just lost my trust in men,"We were making a bar crawl with a group of roughly 15 people yesterday and in one of the bars three british men came in. 
We were on our way to the local river to sit there and enjoy the rest of the evening and one of our guys asked the three brits to come with us to the river 3 seconds after they came in. He probably did not think about how randomly inviting three strange men could affect the women in the group so I will let that pass. One of the brits went directly for me and immediatley came way to close. I was okay with talking with him because I like to practice my english but his jokes about having sex with me and kissing me after like 5 minutes of talking clearly overstepped a line. I then went to walk with some of my friends so he would leave me alone. 
On our way to the river his 2 other colleagues stayed behind so he was the only one of the three who stayed with us. After I got rid of him he talked with another woman of our group. Shortly after she came to us and told us that he made her uncomfortable as well and that she needs us as a safe space right now. He made sexual comments to her too and lay his arm around her shoulder etc. After that he went to the next woman. I was watching them to check if she is okay. Because I was not sure I went to her and said in our native language, which he does not understand, that if she feels uncomfortable she can tell me and I get rid of him. She immediately said that she indeed feels uncomfortable and I promised that I would be right back to send him away. 

Here comes the part that really made me lose my trust in men. 

I knew that he would not take me seriously if I told him to go alone, because he is a sexist who views women as walking fuckholes. Thats why I thought; Hey lets bring a penis because sexists like him respect penises. We are all at university in an european country so I expect the men there to be in average „the wokest“ of our society. So I asked one of my male friends, who I thought would join me immediately if I say that there is a man who makes us women uncomfortable. Instead he did not react at all. All men around us, who heard me saying whats going on did not react. The only person standing up to come with me was my female friend and I know how much she is afraid of confrontations, not to mention with strange men. Only as I said „Okay then I will go alone“ and making my way to the guy, three of the men stood up and followed me. The one I initially asked still sat there, not reacting at all.

I confronted the sexist guy, he of course denied it all and told me I was imagining things. When he drew the racist cart, and said we are sending him away because he is black and that he knew our country was racist I did see no need to talk to him any further because every word after that would be exactly what he wanted to achieve. He wanted that we feel the need to demonstrate that we are in fact not racist at all and put him self in the victim role. 
Three of the men kept talking with him for 5 minutes, helping him to find his way home and I imagine comforting him. It did not look like they were defending us women there but more like they sympathized with him. 

The one I initially asked did still not say anything about the situation and would not for the rest of the night.
When the men of our group finally came back one of them said „I did not see it happen so I have no opinion.“ We told him that when three women felt uncomfortable he does not need to see it happen to believe them. 

So that night I discovered that I can not trust the men around me, who I thought were woke and educated about sexism and sexual abuse, to be there for me or any other women when another men is a threat us. Even when we ask for help.

TLDR: A strange men was hitting inappropriately at the women in our group and made them feel uncomfortable. When I asked my male friends, who I think of as woke, to help me send him away no one reacted in the way I would wish for.",TwoXChromosomes,962,1655373586.0,200,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vdielm/i_really_just_lost_my_trust_in_men/
"Men created an unsafe world and then gaslight us by saying we are ""overly paranoid"" when we take caution.","Obligatory ""not all men"" ""the world isn't safe for men either"" blah blah.

I'm not sure if this post breaks rule 1 but I've seen similar posts and I'm just so fed up. I saw a tiktok video of two girls who were being followed by another car late at night. Somewhere along the comments I replied to someone and said that I'm often called crazy by men because I check the back seats of my car before getting in, and that men don't understand that women live in a different world than they do. And boy did this piss guys off.

I got a lot of replies saying that the men in my life are correct, that I am paranoid, that bad things like this never happen, crime rates are higher for men but we dont see them acting crazy (if this happens to you too, why dont you take precaution? why are you guys so mad about safety?), the whole 9 yards. I even had one say he would follow me around ""for fun' if he knew me. As if that doesn't prove my point, right? It's all a joke to them. They love to harass us, stalk us, kidnap us, kill us, and then laugh in our face when we get scared and chose to put our safety first, even if it is in seemingly ridiculous ways. I had another one say he doesn't want to hear shit from me about life being hard as a woman because apparently, we have it a lot easier than men. Okay.

If being paranoid means I'm going to get home alive, so be it. The world isn't a safe place. For anyone. Acting like it is makes you a fool. I will continue to lock every door and window of my car and house, I won't go out alone at night, I won't put bumper stickers or decoration on my car that gives away I'm a girl, I won't give out my personal information or make conversation with strangers, and I'll carry pepper spray. I'm not going to be lied to and told that trafficking and everything else that happens to us is a myth and I have no right to fear people. Women didn't start this.

Edit: thanks for all the comments. It feels so validating knowing that so many of us feel this way and that the men arguing with me truly are just clueless.

Why do men follow women? ,"I was followed for the first time today. (20F)

Out with my family around 10ish in the night, me and my sister stood back to take some pictures. We were in the city centre, so it was pretty crowded. A lot going on. 

This guy makes eye contact with me, he looked very young, was maybe 23-27. He was behind me and my sister. But kept stopping everytime we stopped, and carried on walking when we were.

And then my sister ran up to my dad, mum, brother and was panicking saying this guy is following us. He stopped and moved to the side and watched us the whole time, making eye contact with me specifically. He then started texting. Then my dad made eye contact with him, stared him down and he stopped following us. I assume he thought me and my sister were alone because we were far behind from my family.

Why tf do men do this? Was he trying to rape us, rob us? What has your experience been? 

I'm still pretty spooked out. Just from the possibilities of what could have happened if we were genuinely alone. Stabbed, robbed, raped, trafficked, I don't know what his intentions were. I could have had my life change drastically based on circumstance.

We were on the way to the car park. If we were alone, he could of just knocked both of us the fuck out and then could have killed us or something. 

Wonder how they pick their victims. Me and my sister are both petite. Maybe we don't look physically intimidating due to this? He was kind of small himself. Maybe like 5'7? And we're a lot smaller than that. What can I do about that?

It makes me sad. Thank god for my dad. Am I only ever safe if I have a man with me?

Thank you to the men and boys who recognize the dangerous positions women can find themselves in and help us without question.,"I was reminded of this by the other post today about a young woman having to assess her risks in asking an adult male stranger for help or being beaten up by a group that was following her. When she saw kids in the car she made a judgement call that this guy could help her and she was right. Thanks to a man who saw a sketchy situation and waited for the young woman to come to him rather than approach her and scare her off. 

I was coming home from a friend's house really late on Friday night. I took a cab of course for safety since it was past 3 am. The driver was nice, family guy with pics of his kids and wife in his car. We chatted on the 10 minute drive. 

When we got to my building there were 2 sketchy looking guys standing right by the entrance to the path that goes to our front door. They were standing on either side of the opening, looking like they were just chatting but I felt off about it. 

As I grabbed my bags from the trunk these two guys never took their eyes off me but kept acting like they were talking to eachother. I leaned over to the driver and whispered ""can you watch an wait until I get inside the building to leave?"" And he said "" already planning to, do you want me to walk you to the door?"" And he did! The sketchy dudes cleared off as soon as they saw he wasn't leaving me alone.

Does anyone else ever get annoyed about how clueless men really are about how scary it is to be a woman?,"As a woman no matter where we are, the mall, work, the grocery store, a party, OUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD, we are constantly scared of being assaulted or kidnapped. The other day the second I got in my car I locked the doors and my boyfriend said something along the lines of “you’re being paranoid” and it made me realize how little he understands. You cannot truly understand how scary it is to be a woman just minding her own damn business walking down the street unless you are one. It makes me feel so bitter that men don’t have to experience that constant fear, so much so that they can’t even begin to comprehend why I might lock my doors when i get into my car, or only wear one headphone while i’m walking in broad daylight, or not want to go to the grocery store alone.

I'm really tired of seeing men compare the fear of being mugged/robbed to the experience of living life as a woman ,"I know this isn't breaking news, but I've recently seen an uptick in the ""men are afraid to walk alone at night, too!!"" argument and it just highlights how much men do not understand. 

Yes. We know men are afraid of being injured or killed while being robbed, or ending up on the wrong side of a drunk at a bar. Nobody has ever claimed *only* women are afraid to walk alone at night, or that the fear of sustaining physical injury due to malignant actors is solely women's domain. 

It's so much more complex and nuanced than that. 

First, it *is* about what we are afraid of, that's true. But women don't shove their keys in between their knuckles or ask to be walked out to their car after work bc we're afraid Mr. Robber McRobberson is going to punch us in the face and take our purse, or even kill us and take our purse. 
We are afraid they will hurt us in ways not one single person should ever be hurt. We are afraid they will strip us of our agency and our dignity and our humanity along with our autonomy. We are afraid they will kidnap us, and sexually torture us before they finally kill us. It is a fear that hangs out in the back of our minds, and permeates the rules we follow: get an escort to your car, don't walk at night with ear buds in, don't put decals on your car that indicate you're a woman. 

And yes, those are extreme cases, and ofc not every woman walks around terrified that Ted Bundy 2.0 will target them all of the time. But the very experience of being a woman adds a layer to it, bc we aren't just afraid of those things. 

While this may seem frivilous to some, we are ""afraid"" beyond that, in ways many men do not experience--the man at the bus stop who sees yoir discomfort and badgers you to go out with him, the man in the elevator who looks at you lile you're a piece of meat and he's a starving carnivore, the man at the gym who demands you take your earbuds out so he can inform you of all the ways in which you're working out wrong. We're afraid of being harassed, of being objectified, of our agency and autonomy being disrespected.

It is this constant and persistent objectification, this tendency by many men to ignore all signs of a woman's discomfort, this pervasive sense of being ""prey"" that truly wears us down. 

So, yes. Men are afraid to walk alone at night, too. We get it. 

But y'all are afraid of losing your wallet and your pride. We're afraid of losing our humanity. ",TwoXChromosomes,779,1724600454.0,95,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1f0z98y/im_really_tired_of_seeing_men_compare_the_fear_of/

"Just go screamed at by a normal seeming dude, still feel shaken up","There was a recent thread about how different women’s experiences are. I’m one of those that is usually left alone, I’ve been told by friends that I’m extremely unapproachable to strangers, like there’s a force field around me. I don't know why I'm writing this out, but I just need reassurance I suppose that this is fine, I'll be fine.

Well, I just went to get cash at an ATM. Just moved, super tired, new city. The ATM is stupidly positioned, it’s in a quiet side street, there’s a huge temporary (construction?) structure positioned behind it, so you’ve basically got the approach to the ATM, and then you’re blocked in from three sides.

A guy was sitting in this approach section. I eyed him as I walked to the ATM and weighed whether I should use it or not. He looked normal enough, late 20s or early 30s, wearing headphones, sitting there chilling while it’s raining. So I thought he’s having lunch or just waiting out the rain.

He speaks to me while I’m at the fricking ATM. “How’s your day, good? Despite the weather?” and so on. I don’t really engage, just say fine, look back at the ATM. He keeps talking “yeah, thank you, I’m having a nice day too, and whatever you’re thinking right now, same to you”.

So here’s my mistake, as I walk away I tell him “that’s really the wrong place to talk to people” and wish him a nice day. Then walk away. He takes off his headphones, all “what, what?”, and then started the abuse “what’s your damage, stupid bitch, what’s your problem” and “bitch, bitch” and “fuck you, go fuck yourself” at the top of his voice. Luckily he remained seated, I just walked over to the nearest store, entered, and when the bus arrived left the store and quickly got in, making sure he’s nowhere close by.

That’s it. First super crappy experience. I feel shaken up and honestly threatened, even though I know it’s not reasonable. He doesn’t know where I live and I’ll likely avoid that part of the city for a while. I’m in Switzerland, never had any issues, walked home in the middle of the night. This was new, I know it’s all about him, nothing to do with me, but what gets me is that he looked absolutely norma, until he started talking, and he likely reacted to me not being all smiley at him. I feel I did nothing wrong, yet now I will be the one avoiding that area and hoping to never encounter him again.

Edit: Shoutout to the user who sent me this private message. You're a hypocrite.

""Maybe mind your own business, when it's absolutely clear he meant no harm and was just making nice small talk to a stranger. You're not an authority figure to him. You're not his mom. You can't tell him what to do. Pick your battles better. It I was just trying to be nice to someone and they seemingly told me not to talk to them. I would think that to be highly rude and offensive. Just say hi back and leave. You ain't some moral authority up on her high horse. Be a person.""

Edit2: Thanks everyone for your comments and kindness. After sleeping it over I'm fine now. I know the event had nothing to do with me but I just needed to work it out of my system.

A couple notes regarding people's questions:

- the guy was sitting about 3-4m away from the ATM (not 10m, I was still in a state when I wrote that)  
- he started to talk to me once I had my hand in my backpack, so was ""locked in"" in a sense  
- I didn't write down everything he said because I didn't parse it, I was concentrated on the transaction and on keeping myself safe  
- I'm in a country where smalltalk is not a thing, people who do it will be considered suspicious or unhinged  
- I don't think he was homeless or mentally ill, but I am not in a capacity to judge honestly  
- he was treated with the same politeness and in the same manner I show everyone else. I didn't curse him out, make faces at him, enhance body language or anything. I just politely told him an ATM might not be the best area to chat up people. That's it. This is the first negative response I received to my behavior, I will not modify it because of him.   
- even if he were homeless, it's a temporary state, not a personality trait. It wouldn't change my treatment of of a person for this, all humans are equal until proven distrustful. 

Finally, why am I still justifying myself? Instinct to blame myself, I suppose, and overwhelm at the amount of engagement this post received. This topic is closed for me now, though.

This post just got blocked on unpopular opinions for being too “political”,"Online dating is a fantastic invention and we shouldn’t go back - not because women have “all the choice and can flock to Chad” but because you can avoid (more of) the assholes and stay safe(r)

The reason: it allows you to screen people out. I’m in my thirties, I know I don’t need my SOs to be six feet tall or conventionally attractive (I’ve never dated anyone tall?) But I DO need people who are kind and patient and who are going to respect that I’m bi, that I have a pretty high powered career, and that I have no plans to give up either. 

You’re a short or middling height person of any gender identity and any gender expression with any body type, with maybe a job but definitely a sense of humor and some patience? Sold. Artists, gamers, programmers, creatives, people working “just a job”? All great. 

You write nothing in your profile, have “traditional family values”, are looking for a unicorn, expect to be the breadwinner, are politically apathetic, are opposed to abortion rights, or feel it’s your God given right to have my attention? Great for me to learn that early, we can just be two ships passing in the night and no one’s time is wasted. 

In my twenties, I thought I had to be polite and give at least some time to people (generally cis men) who approached me. Online? Nope, I’m not replying to your d*** pic or aggressive sexual solicitation, I can just block you and move on with my day, and you’re not following me stating that you’re a nice guy if only I gave you a chance. 

I also have a picture of you before we meet up and can text it to a friend for safety. 

With women? We’re not doing the awkward are you romantically interested in women dance, ha, it’s great. 

Caveat: I acknowledge online harassment can still be a drag, would recommend Bumble to all women whether trans or cis. Yeah, online dating can be exhausting and demoralizing, but for me? Not as exhausting as agreeing to go on a date and then finding out my date is kind of racist and wants five kids.",TwoXChromosomes,1003,1664748300.0,146,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xu1a8t/this_post_just_got_blocked_on_unpopular_opinions/
My ex is re-imagining my abortion online with half-truths and lies. It feels like he is taking that event from me. I have a chance to bring this up at an event in my state. Should I even bother?,"I don't even know if this is the right place. My ex and I no longer speak. It has been two years. Two long and peaceful years since the tragic 3 months we found ourselves together. I am growing as a person, learning, refocusing on me.

My abortion was a deep mixture of emotions. I am firmly pro-choice and the thought of abortion doesn't make me uncomfortable. 

My ex is an avid male redditor and pretty out spoken on most social media. 

I avoid looking. He is basically doesn't exist to me anymore and I like it that way. 

My abortion was hard for me. It was hard on my body. Although, I would have eventually made the choice to have an abortion on my own, he forced me to make a decision fairly quickly ( I knew early on as I had some unusual medical symptoms very early). It was either do this or his life is over for him. Which I understood.

I agreed without getting a chance to really think about it or talk it over or take my time to reach my own decision. I was butt-hurt about it. Mostly at myself for allowing that to happen. It made me feel like a child. 

We live in a smaller, big town so everyone sort of knows everyone. I stumbled upon a few posts he made as he is vehemently pro choice (but really he is just pro abortion when he wants it) about his run in with an abortion clinic on the exact date of my abortion date. How there were lines and lines of picketers, how he helped his traumatized girlfriend fend off the anger of one who had the nerve to get in her face, how he bravely held my hand while I set through people telling me not to do it. How I had to view pictures of the ultrasound, etc. How I almost caved but he encouraged me to stand by my convictions. 

Well, he never mentioned my name but unless he went to two abortions that day (not even time) then he was using my experience as a platform to inflate his own ego. 

It angers me because zero of that was true. There were zero picketers when we went. The nurse that I asked said they usually only get them on special days when a local church or someone else decides to get everyone together to picket. Even then she said they aren't allowed on the property. They stand on the street, they can't come through the big fence. So you pull through and the gates closes and they can't see you and you can't see them. And they have never personally had any problems with protesters getting in anyone's face. She said most are keep it clean and civil. There are a few that are over the top but most would never approach the women.Maybe she was just saying that to make me feel better but my two follow ups where I went alone went over without any picketing. 

He never held my hand or gave me support. He was purely focused on me just getting it done. He brought a book in the waiting room, sat in a corner and never said anything really. Not to me or to anyone. I never had to watch any videos and the nurses and aids at the clinic were nothing but supportive of my decision/ needs.They held my hand, they asked me what I really wanted, told me what I needed to know. It was true that they were required to do an ultrasound but just to see how far along I was. I was asked if I wanted to look at the screen or not. I declined and she smiled and turned it away from me. She didn't ask me if I wanted to know how far along I was. They let me dictate what I wanted to know. 

It was tough and I cried. They said it was pretty normal. 

All of it was done in one day. I had to come back the next day just for a simple blood test to see if my hormone level was dropping. Then 4 weeks later for a check up. That was it. It was oddly simple for me, although I know for other women it is much harder depending on the area and how far along you are.   

The procedure was done and over and he drove me home. He didn't stay for the hours he claimed to make sure I was alright. He didn't stand up for anything he claimed. He high-jacked my experience.     

I feel angry, not enough to break my non contact with him but angry that he took an experience that was mine and made himself the hero. 

It took something away from me. Every time I see someone share what he claims is his experience with abortion in the ""backwards"" south, I get angry. It wasn't his experience. Sure, he has an experience tied to it. I am not taking away that he shouldn't have emotions tied to it. 

 It was mine too though and he is perverting it for his own ego. 

It is gross. 

I've been asked to speak at a event for women in the south and their experiences with things such as abortion, domestic violence, etc. 

I am not sure if this is even worth bringing up since he will likely be at the same event (given his sudden activism with abortion, he will have a booth there. He retells that story a lot of that particular day that just happens to be the exact same day as my abortion as the tipping point of what got him into activism). I don't want to take the focus away from the issues but I also think it would good to bring up to the women and men there that each experience is unique and it is your own and that having someone take that away from you can be a problem. Misinformation can cause a lot of problems.

Loss of Innocence,"My daughter is 16. Short, skinny, good looking. Today she was at a gas station to grab something to eat and a man in his 50's or 60's tried to grab her outside, then followed her inside repeating ""I just want to say hi and get to know you"" as he tried to get ahold of her. Her friend inside the gas station (a boy) had to physically shove the guy away from her. The guy then went outside and climbed in the truck with 2 other guys. Her ""friend"" told her she'd be fine and to just go to her truck, and said no when she asked him to walk her out. Dipshit.

She called me, scared and crying. She really thought she was going to be kidnapped. She was terrified. I've never heard that fear in her voice. But I recognized it from experience. I have been assaulted more times than I'd like, and had countless other creepy encounters. The best part about reaching my late 30's and putting on a little weight is that it doesn't happen as often. After an encounter with an 80 year old man ( I was six months pregnant and had my 2 year old by my side)- I vowed to never be alone with another man that wasn't my husband or father. And the incidents stopped for the most part, at least the physical ones.

I've warned her for years. Trying to tell her enough to be aware and wary, but age appropriate and trying not to terrify her of men for life. It's such a hard balance. And in a way I'm grateful, because she had the ""I'm 16 and invincible"" attitude- but now she doesn't. I know it  could have been so much worse and I am so grateful she wasn't harmed- but what the fuck??? She told me she was just wearing jeans a tshirt, so why did he mess with her? That's what the world tells her- it's our own fault, we must have been asking for it. Now she knows. And now she's scared.

IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS!!! I told her the next 10/15 years are going to be the worst. This probably won't be the last time it happens to her. And it breaks my fucking heart so fucking much. I hate this. I hate being a woman sometimes. I hate that I can't protect her or stop it from happening. I hate that they do this to us.

For the record, I know it's not all men. I have been happily married almost 18 years. But even my husband doesn't understand. Unless you've been there and experienced it, you don't understand the pure terror and feeling of helplessness. I hope this is the only time she has an experience like this. I would give anything for it to be. But it's probably not. And that's the most fucked up part.

Update: I called the Sheriff's Dept to find out what we should do after she called me. The Sheriff was there at the school within minutes and interviewed her. They got footage from the gas station. They didn't have him on camera physically assaulting her so they don't think they'll be able to arrest him for anything, but they did trespass him from the store for a year and the sheriff said he would talk to the man and make sure it didn't happen again. I'm thankful they took her seriously, and they were quick to act. That's something at least.

Unlearning: A Message to My Daughter,"I need to remember what I’ve learned, so that I know what I need to unlearn. For her.

\-

When I was four years old, I remember answering the door without a shirt on. My grandma was watching me and my brothers at home. I guess she invited some guy over. Afterwards, I remember being scolded for letting a man see my bare chest. 

I learned that something is wrong with my body. That it needs to be covered and that I’m bad if it isn’t.

\-

I remember this same grandma sarcastically replying to my young pleadings for candy and toys with: “How do you plan to pay for them? With your good looks?” 

I learned that being pretty can get me what I want.

\-

I remember being told by smiling strangers that my big brown eyes were sure to cause trouble for my dad. I remember being told that I’d need to “fight off” boys. 

I learned that boys are dangerous, but that to be wanted by them is a good thing.

\-

I remember my mom refusing to leave the house before “putting on her face.” I remember thinking that was a funny thing to say—that she didn’t have a face without makeup.

I remember when I started shaving my legs. I asked my mom how often she shaved hers. She said every day. 

I learned that it’s important to *always* look your best, and that you’re not really you unless you’re the best-looking version of you.

\-

I remember hearing and sharing countless “your mama’s so fat” jokes in elementary school. I remember hearing my stepdad tell cruder versions to his friends. 

I learned that being fat is such a bad thing that it can bring shame to your family. 

\-

When I was ten years old, I remember wearing my mom’s high school cheerleading uniform for Halloween. It was perfect, her school colors were orange and black. I remember outgrowing it within two years and feeling embarrassed and resentful toward anyone smaller than me, including my own mother. 

I remember this sentiment being shared amongst my friends, with a popular attitude of “She’s perfect. I hate her.”

I learned that to acknowledge another girl’s beauty somehow detracts from my own. 

\-

I remember spending a hot, summer weekend at my dad’s house when I was eleven years old. My little brother and sister were playing outside in the sprinkler and I’d put on my two-piece bathing suit to join them. I remember my stepmom looking at the hair on my lower back in disgust and telling me that she’d wax it if she were me. I later remember the fixation I developed, crying as I wrote about it in my diary and vowing to save my babysitting dollars to get laser hair removal.

I learned that girls aren’t supposed to have any body hair and that getting rid of it is a top priority.

\-

I remember my mom asking for “just a small bite” of the numerous birthday cakes, bowls of ice cream, and after dinner desserts we had throughout my childhood. But I never remember her having her own helping. Some of her go-to ‘treats’ were rice cakes and a few tootsie rolls. She was incredibly disciplined with her diet. 

I remember wanting to emulate her discipline. When I felt desperate, I remember wanting to starve myself. I didn’t want an eating disorder *per se,* but I wanted to know that I had enough power to stop eating–just to shed those few extra pounds. I remember being hungry and finally giving in. I remember feeling shame that I was too weak to control my body.

One time I asked my mom what she thought heaven was like. I remember a huge smile crossing her face as she described a place full of food. She said that in heaven you can eat whatever you want without gaining any weight.

I learned that food is a temptation like other vices—meant to be overcome through willpower and discipline. A failure to be fit is a failure of character.

\-

When I was in middle school, I remember hearing about ‘model weight.’ This was the supposed weight limit if you wanted to be a professional model. I didn’t want to be a model, but I wanted to look like one. I remember forever trying to stay under 110 lbs. and never achieving my goal. I remember lying about my weight for years.

I learned that I’d rather pretend to be the ideal weight than to be honest.

\-

I remember being thirteen and trying on a new bikini I’d bought from a Victoria Secret magazine. I remember bursting into tears because I thought it made me look fat. My mom saw how upset I was and tried to help. She offered advice: always burn more calories than you eat. I remember creating a notebook to track everything I consumed. I remember cutting out photos from fashion magazines of thin women and making a collage on the cover for motivation. I remember showing it to my mom and her smiling in approval.

I learned that dieting is the answer to a thinner, happier life.

\-

I remember staying the night at my grandma’s apartment. I must have been around twelve years old. I remember her watching some true crime show about violent rape. She told me to pay attention, because it wasn’t a matter of *if* I’d be raped one day, but *when*. 

I learned to be terrified of men. I learned to protect myself by doing my best to always appease them. 

\-

I remember being asked several times by boys in high school if I still had my virginity, or “v-card” as we called it. When I said yes, there was always a smile or nod of approval. I also remember being pressured by some of those same boys to have sex.

I learned that there’s almost nothing as valuable as staying a virgin if you’re a girl, and almost nothing worse if you’re a guy. 

\-

I remember being sexually harassed at school. In sixth grade, it got so bad that I began skipping recess and tried to report the boy to the teacher. I was told I should be flattered and to just ignore him. 

During my junior year, I stopped going to my first period early to avoid the boy who sat on my desk each morning awaiting my arrival. I actively hid from him in the halls and was constantly on the lookout to avoid him during lunch and after school. I don’t remember ever telling him to leave me alone. I think I was afraid it’d make things worse –at least he was friendly when he harassed me. 

I remember being sexually harassed at work. I remember hiding in storage closets and walk-in freezers when certain customers arrived. I remember my colleagues covering for me and saying I wasn’t there. 

I remember one of my coworkers offering me his entire paycheck if I’d give him a lap dance. 

I learned it is normal behavior to be harassed as a female—and that it is something I should tolerate, or even welcome, because it means I’m attractive. 

\-

I remember being seventeen and working my evening shift at a waterfront restaurant as a hostess. It was a slow evening, and an older couple came in. I sat them near the window. The wife immediately left to use the restroom. I proceeded to ask her husband if he’d like water and bread. As I turned around to fetch them, I remember him slapping my ass. I remember feeling flushed with embarrassment and trying to convince myself that he must have meant to pat me on the small of my back. I kept walking. A middle-aged server grabbed my arm as she passed me and sternly whispered into my ear, “Never let a man touch you like that again.” I remember muttering “okay” while my embarrassment flared into a burning shame.

I learned that I *let* this happen to me and that it was my fault if men touched me in inappropriate ways. I learned that it is my responsibility, not theirs, to stop this type of behavior.

\-

In college, I remember trying to be “one of the guys” by telling sexist jokes and degrading other women. I remember talking trash about sorority girls and saying things like, “I’m glad I’m a girl so that I never have to date one.” I remember feeling proud when the guys I was around laughed. 

I learned that putting other women down is rewarded.

\-

I remember countless diets. Veganism, keto, fasting, juicing, and so on. I remember trying to exercise more—joining gyms, kickboxing clubs, and yoga studios. I remember feeling elated when I’d lose a couple of pounds. And I remember falling out of my routine repeatedly as life happened; as I moved, travelled, started graduate school, and got pregnant. I remember feeling like a failure. 

I remember telling my mom that I was going to start trying for a baby and her advising me that July was a good time to get pregnant because I could wear a bikini before showing, then have the baby, and then lose the weight before it was summer again. 

I remember telling our family that we were expecting and immediately hearing about weight—how much my mother-in-law had gained with each pregnancy and how I’d likely never lose it all. I remember my father-in-law jokingly asking me if I could fit back into my jeans when my baby girl was only a few weeks old.

I learned that we measure health based on how our bodies look.

\-

I remember last week when I looked at my body with despair just two months post-partum. Then I remember that my body created, birthed, and is sustaining a healthy little human. I remember that I have a child and that whether I intend it or not, she’ll learn from me. She’ll watch, she’ll listen, and she’ll learn.

I’ve learned that it’s time to unlearn so much. It’s time to unlearn that harassment is normal and okay and start calling it out. It’s time to unlearn that other women are competition and start actively supporting them. It’s time to unlearn that we’re responsible for the actions of boys and men; it’s time to unlearn fear by expecting better and holding them accountable. It’s time to unlearn that worth is linked to looks; that health and happiness are likened to body size and beauty.

Ladies we need one another more than ever.,"Edit: I see the men who peruse this subreddit are offended and downvoting. I posted this comment first in a different subreddit discussing how a woman on her first date was drugged, gangraped and left for dead behind a dumpster in an area shed never been to and surprise surprise its not being downvoted. **The men in this sub need to fuck right off. Women absolutely need to discuss how the fuck this shit type of violence against us happens.**

Men dont sit there huddled in groups openly admitting the violent atrocities they fantasize about comitting against women.

They start with tiny comments that dehumanize women. That progresses into long running jokes about womens sexuality and bodies.

They test the waters this way. The men who respond well to this they then bond together over their general disdain for women, sharing stories of ex wives and girlfriends, sisters and mothers, aunts and coworkers, women who rejected them. All the stories share 1 common factor which is that the men are painted as fair and just and right, the women are painted as whores and clowns and villans, useless fecks.

The underlying theme is always women have what men want and cant have and its not fair or right that women have bodily autonomy and then choose to avoid these men somehow.

They share media, porn, and fantasies eventually about getting even, taking what they want from women.

The group narrows to eventually only be men whom all agree broadly that something can and should be done to get what they believe they deserve from women while also degrading and shaming, punishing women for their choices.

Thats when the planning can make an entrance. The fantadtical talk suddenly becomes an idea shared and plans start entering the tweaking phase.

The small group collaborates and then its a hunt to find the right victim to execute their machinations.

Its never just from the get go men proudly sharing a handshake openly planning to violate another human being violently.

It takes time to fester and brew and the men who would never engage in this must be weeded out. Sometimes this process takes years. Sometimes its a matter of months. It depends on how fast they can weed out the men who wouldnt be interested from those who would and all it takes is one loud mouthed leader to escalate things.

The truth is MANY men whom we as women think we are safe around would absolutely never admit to the fact that they would LOVE to sexually violate and or torture women if they knew for a fact that 1 nobody they respect would find out and 2 there would be absolutely zero consequences if anyone they respected did find out.

Women need to listen to theirs guts and anticipate that men can and will harm them. No amount of trust can protect us.

If theyre that guy, then youre at risk.

Tells women can pay attention to will be generalized misogyny in the form of jokes or comments or the absence of protest to others making egregious jokes and comments about women.

Men who arent interested in violating women dont feel comfortable when other men make statements that inherently lead down the path Ive described. These men have been men long enough to see what other men want to do to us. Theres weeding out sessions everywhere they turn. Even unconciously men know wtf men really mean and wtf men are capable of.

Everyone and I mean it...EVERYONE knows at least 2 dudes who would gladly rape a bitch and dump her behind a garbage bin, whether we know it or not. These men are far from uncommon. These men are everywhere. Presenting as good guys.

Err on the side of caution ladies, theyre everywhere. The more misogyny is normalized, the more women are marginalized, the less autonomy we have the more emboldened these men are. Its not a coincidence, its these men wanting to hop out of their dark closets and be free to use and abuse us as they see fit.

We are a commodity they seek to consume, not people. Dont forget it, dont let your gaurd down. Consider dating in groups rather than alone. Like double dating or group meet date for trivia night ect.

Alone we are easy to peck off. We need eachother more than ever.",TwoXChromosomes,638,1718898395.0,79,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1dkevtv/ladies_we_need_one_another_more_than_ever/
Should I be worried about this guy or am I just overthinking? He's making me super uncomfortable.,"EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your responses, I'm going to go with my gut on this and tell my supervisor next week when I see her. She's always made it clear that I can go to her if I'm having any concerns and I think she'll be able to help me deal with this situation (I'm pretty new at this place and the working world in general, this is my first real job actually, so I'm not very experienced in how all of this works and how to make reports and such). Will update this afterwards, I think. 

One of the security guards at my place of work is currently making me feel the exact opposite of secure.

At first he seemed fine, greeting me in the mornings when I arrived at work and saying goodbye as I left in the evening. Sometimes he'd make a little small talk, about the weather, or the weekend, but other than that I didn't talk much with him.

One day, when I was leaving, he was waiting outside for me, and gestured for me to come over to him... he then proceeded to give me his number. I didn't know how to deal with this situation at all, I was too nervous to say no, I didn't want to be rude. I took his number, but did not contact him. Once I got home I realized that the spot he had been waiting for me was... unusual. Security guards don't tend to be positioned in that spot - they stand by the entrances to the building. This guy was nowhere near an entrance. He was on a corner, where the building meets the street, around the back of the building. I thought this was... weird. But put it down to me overthinking things as I tend to do. 

I was worried about going to work in the morning for the following days, knowing he was likely to be there at the entrance... and he was eventually gonna ask why I hadn't called. I tried my best to avoid him. Luckily on the times I did run into him, he didn't bring it up. Maybe he got the message that I wasn't interested, I thought??? 

Now....this week, I did not see him at all. Up until now I had been seeing him at work almost every day. I figured he must be on a vacation or sick or something, and was honestly kinda relieved that he wasn't there.

Until today. I left work today, and as I was walking up the (very quiet!!) street on the side of the building, I heard someone calling my name. I turned around and he's parked on the side of the fucking road and he gestures for me to come over to him. Absolutely not, there is no way I'm going to approach a stranger's vehicle. I yelled over to him, ""Sorry but I'm in a hurry, need to catch my bus!"" and quickly walked away. As far as I could tell, he wasn't in his uniform (the bright jackets the guards usually wear). And hadn't been working that day. What on earth was he doing there?? Was he a seriously there waiting for me?? I was actually really scared at this point and got paranoid that he would follow me... (he didn't, thank god..)

But... wtf.... Was he trying something? Or was he just completely oblivious how creepy that was?????? I don't know what to think.

I don't know if I'm overthinking this, if I'm making a big deal out of nothing. But I don't feel so safe. This guy is freaking me out. I'm scared that he'll do this again or worse. Or maybe he's just a genuinely nice guy but completely oblivious??? I don't know.

I guess I'm looking for some perspective, some other opinions. Is his behaviour creepy, should I be worried?? Or am I being dramatic?? Am I being an asshole here???? What do I do? I'm freaking out.

“Women who wear that kind of top are asking for men to look”,"I live on the other side of the country from my parents so I don’t see them often.  They are in town visiting and we all went to the pool. I am wearing a low-cut swimsuit (lower than usual for me), but nothing too crazy. I was sitting with my dad by the pool. A man walked by and took a long look at me and kind of gestures to his own chest area and said “boy, I’d like to get inside there!” (Inside my top, I guess?) I felt embarrassed. After the man passed and a few more awkward moments of silence later, I said “well that was awkward” just to say something I guess. 

My dad replied, “well, you are looking for attention like that. Women who wear that kind of swimsuit top are asking men to look.” I fell silent. I didn’t know what to say. I went to the bathroom and started crying. Now I’m so embarrassed to be wearing this and I don’t think I can handle being around my dad the rest of the week. I expected…better from him, I guess? I just was having a good day and now feel so shitty because of these two men.

Edit: ooookay, my dad must have said something to my mom. She just asked me if there was a way to take a safety pin and close my top more securely. She said “it looks like you’re trying too hard with how it is.” I don’t think I can stand to be around either of them another second. I feel so awkward, humiliated, slutty….and angry at them.

Edit: thank you everyone for the kind words! Some interesting discussions came up. A lot of people said it’s fine to look but not comment. I agree, but this man was leering, and that is never okay IMO. Some of you said I should not let other people affect me or bring me down. I am human. I am also in therapy to get better at this exact thing, so I’m working on it! (This situation is just a glimpse into my upbringing, so I have a lot to unlearn)

I talked to my brother on the phone last night who is a big supporter. I told him I am putting down strict guidelines my parents have to follow if they want to keep seeing me. If they don’t follow those, I will cut off contact. I am scared to do this but also kind of excited? Thank you for all the help in the comments.

I'm afraid to be home and I'm afraid to be out in public.,"Edit: thank you for all of your kind, compassionate, and supportive responses. Except one of you and the person who sent a ""reddit cares.""

I've been married to a wonderful man for almost 9 years. He's a lefty, feminist, voted for Kamala, and while he *was* prone to some willfull incompetence (which he's really improved on because he actually gave a shit when I brought it up), he's a wonderful man, partner, and dog-dad. He got fixed (vasectomy) so we could avoid pregnancy after a IUD failure. I feel the most at peace and safe with him.

He's in the military (I know, I know... I never expected to meet a man who I could love who was a career military man but he's moved farther and farther left along with me over the years) and just became an officer, before the election happened. He just moved to his next duty station in another state and I'm staying here in the house until spring, which is historically the best time of year to sell where I live (PNW).

I'm alone in a big house in a rural area. It's a blue state but a red area. I have three dogs. If you have dogs, you're familiar with the ""barking at nothing"" they tend to do. But you can typically tell the difference between ""barking at nothing"" and barking at something actually happening. 

The other night, when I was not expecting, there was a loud thunk at my door. It's November in the PMW so it was DARK outside. All of the dogs started barking ferociously and I was terrified. Especially when I looked out my front door and saw someone standing at it. I almost had a true proper panic attack until I realized it was Amazon making a delivery. Everything was fine.

Today, I had to go to the grocery store(s) and people on the roads were extra impatient and two people honked at me for not endangering myself to pull into traffic for their convenience. I was afraid they'd have guns or something, so I changed my route to avoid holding either up anymore. 

After this fucking election, I'm terrified. 

Seeing everything online - what men are saying to women, the texts Black people are receiving, other people of color being targeted even harder than usual immediately, knowing what I do about Project 25...

I voted for her. My husband voted for her. All the close friends I keep voted for her. I encouraged everyone who would listen to me to vote (I don't keep company with anyone who would vote for the orange man).

What else could I/we have done?

I'm terrified to be home alone. I'm terrified to be out in public alone. I'm terrified for the next few years. I'm terrified for the next few decades as a result of the next few years. I could go on and on and on about everything I'm terrified of.

And for chaos' sake, I'm a cis white woman who does not outwardly look disabled. I cannot imagine how terrified women of color and disabled women feel in the face of all of this.

To the stranger who cared about my safety: thank you.,"A couple of nights ago I was on my way home from a babysitting job. By the time I finished up it had been dark for a few hours, but I was in such a ""safe"" neighborhood that I wasn't worried. I was walking alone back to my car (parked barely a block away) when I noticed that another car had stopped up the block from me and was idling in the middle of the street. The driver did not move until I had reached my car and gotten inside, at which point they immediately drove past me and went on their way. I saw the driver (a middle-aged woman) and realized that she had been using her headlights to illuminate the street so that I wouldn't have to walk alone in the dark. 

Even though it was a relatively small gesture in the grand scheme of things, I was incredibly touched by what this stranger did for me. I know that there is an incredibly low chance that I will ever be able to thank her personally, so I wanted to reach out and share with all of you. To everyone who takes the time to look out for the well-being of strangers, thank you.",TwoXChromosomes,1929,1501219414.0,156,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6q1qun/to_the_stranger_who_cared_about_my_safety_thank/
"In a dark and deeply emotional state, I called the after abortion hotline: Exhale. All counselors were busy. I waited and called again. And called again. And called again. Until the receiptionist told me they couldn't help me.","I took misoprostol three weeks ago, effectively terminating my very early pregnancy. I had never been pregnant before and this whole experience has shook me to my core. 

I want to have children one day but I'm young, two years into my career and in a new city without family or friends. I told my partner as soon as I found out and he was very supportive, accompanying me on my first trip to Planned Parenthood to weight our options. But there was only one choice for him and it was termination. In all honesty, it's what I wanted too.

But as soon as I took the misoprostol, he disappeared. Ghosted me. That hurt beyond words. A few friends knew about my recent decision and have offered guidance. But no one understood the pain and grief I'm going through. Somehow, this bundle of cells has changed me forever. 

So last night, I found myself alone in my apartment and very depressed. A thought of suicide even crossed my mind. Scared to be alone with my own thoughts, I remembered Exhale and thought it might be a good time to give them a call. 

So I did. The receiptionist told me all counselors were engaged and to call back in 30 mins. Annoyed but understanding, I hung up and played on my phone for a while to distract me. I called back again. Same receiptionist, same reply. A little defeated, I decided I'd call back if I couldn't fall asleep. But my thoughts were running rampid. I called once more and received the same reply from the receiptionist. At this point, I was sobbing and just asked ""Please, I'm in emotional distress. I need someone to talk to. Can't I just wait on hold?"" 

With which the receiptionist replied ""Ma'am, there's nothing we can do to help you. You'll just have to call back at a different time or a different day."" 

I was shell shocked. I have wonder about this receiptionist's training, considering how emotional and raw women are calling in. 

It's difficult for people suffering with grief to ask for help. It's even more difficult when the people who are supposed to help us say they can't. 

UPDATE: Thank you all for the support. I was able to schedule an emergency appointment with my therapist today. I haven't stopped reaching out for help. I think with everything happening in the world today, it's important to not stop asking. 

UPDATE 2: I appreciate all the overwhelming support I have received! I am trying to respond to each message because you all have been so important to me. I never thought strangers would make me feel so loved. Bless you all.

I guess I saved someone’s life today?,"That feels absurd to say, but I guess in a very real and literal sense that’s what happened. I don’t know who else to tell, but this group of gals and pals are the most supportive community I know on this site, so here we are. 

We were having a big potluck lunch at work and I’ve only been there a month or two, so besides my immediate coworkers I don’t know most people. I walked into the empty break room to toss my plate. One of my coworkers was in there alone, but there’s maybe 60 of us in our department and I didn’t recognize her, so at first I didn’t plan to engage. We happened to make eye contact, and… shit. Her eyes were the size of dinner plates and she looked so panicked and was clearly trying to cough but just… couldn’t. 

Asked her if she was choking and she nodded, so I gave her the Heimlich. She coughed a bunch of food onto the floor, I came back to the front of her and asked if that was all of it and she shook her head, so I did the Heimlich again until the rest of it came up. 

She’s fine. I’m fine. But I feel so incredibly rattled even hours later, so I can’t imagine how she’s feeling. We walked back out into the hall where everyone else was and our big boss was giving a speech so we had to just stand there in silence with the rest of the employees. I kept looking at her to make sure she was okay, and every time I looked at her she was looking back at me too. After the speech and a round of jeopardy I was going to go back to my desk but the deputy director called me over and said that the woman had told her what happened. The deputy started talking about how I was a “hero” and took a few pictures of her and I together. 

Everyone is talking about how proud of myself I should be— one coworker even said she was “jealous” because she’d been a lifeguard but never got to use any of her first aid training. I feel sick. Like what if I hadn’t gone to toss my plate, what if i’d kept my head down and avoided eye contact like I usually do. What if i’d frozen. And I didn’t—luckily— but oh my god. I could’ve been the last person this woman saw today as she died an agonizing and terrifying death. A total stranger alone with her in the break room as 60 people she actually knew laughed and partied 20 feet away.  

It feels a lot less like “I saved someone’s life” and a lot more like “I almost watched a mother of four die today”. 

Choking isn’t like the movies. It’s silent and it’s fast. Don’t go get water, don’t walk away from people. Wave your arms, cause a scene, get attention immediately. Thank Christ I took that Red Cross babysitter’s class when I was 13 or I don’t know what I would’ve done today. 

Her and her husband went and bought me a bouquet of flowers that she brought me at my desk later in the afternoon— and as I look at them I just can’t stop thinking that I’m so grateful I’m not having to order lillies and chrysanthemums for her family.

EDIT: Thank you all for your words and support. My therapist left her practice back in August and I’m in a weird in-between where there wasn’t much point in finding someone new knowing that my insurance was about to change when I got this job and I wouldn’t be eligible for help from the someone at the same practice, so it’s been a few months without someone. But Nov 1 my insurance kicks in and it’s a priority to find someone new. 

Thank you for validating that my feelings about it are rational. I didn’t sleep as well as I could have last night, but waking up to these comments really helped. I sort of needed to just dump all of my thoughts into text, and if even one person took the time to refresh their knowledge of first aid or considered signing up for classes then I’m so glad I did.",TwoXChromosomes,1423,1697767459.0,67,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17c0300/i_guess_i_saved_someones_life_today/
Every man in the UK should watch Undercover Sexual Harassment,"Channel 4 aired a documentary last night where a reporter goes undercover to show the sexual harassment so many women go through every day. I just want to warn that some may be triggered, so you might want to google it before watching.

The reporter, Ellie Flynn, looks at sexual harassment from multiple angles. She spoke to teenagers, so many speaking of being sexually harassed at the age of 10. That wearing a school uniform actually made them more of a target even though that makes it even more obvious they are underaged.

She went onto dating apps and got harassed by men sending dick pics and videos after hardly talking to them and then confronted them. In what world do women want random dick pics from strangers? When is this ever a good idea? Do any of you ever want an unsolicited dick pic? The sense of entitlement some of these men have over women just because they claim to be “horny” is so gross. 

She was even followed by men randomly on the street who thought she was drunk so they could take advantage of her. 

This should be required viewing for so many men, to help them better understand what women go through. I’d recommend giving it a watch and maybe even encouraging your male friends to watch if you’re in the UK.",TwoXChromosomes,1158,1670954517.0,106,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zl29c9/every_man_in_the_uk_should_watch_undercover/
I don't like celebrating my birthday but I still think my partner should not have done what he did yesterday,"Long story short I'm a Thanksgiving baby raised in a family where NPD runs rampant my birthday was always on Thanksgiving as to not inconvenience anyone and just combined into the family gathering every year no fail I didn't know my birthdays actual date until 7th grade where I was bullied and laughed at when a school counselor asked my birthday and became angry and concerned that I said it's always on Thanksgiving no matter how much they responded it wasn't possible. There were a few years presents were forgotten and those years my birthday was on Black Friday where 8 year old me was draged out to the Jersey City outlet mall to get my own gifts that had never been wrapped and in 2014 when my extended family cut off my immediate family because my mom attempted to break the cycle I never heard from them again and began having my birthday on the actual day but still ice cream cake forgotten in the garage to melt parties where I was told I was making the whole thing about me it left a taste in my mouth of having a birthday in the sense of recognizing and celebrating it was not worth it. 

In 2017 I met my partner right before going to college and I decided I would no longer have a birthday. I tell people who need to know and everyone else I just say oh I don't celebrate or share and most people move on. I have been with my partner since then and they always get me gifts and cards but never have done anything which is fine and just how I like it, but this year was different and I want to know if I'm in the wrong.

I am currently recovering with an unruptured brain aneurysm essentially swollen blood vessels in my brain impacting my vargus nerve which as made me incredibly sick since mid September. Also in thai time my workload has increased tenfold with some large name clients running their ads across the US on a national TV network and they have 0 sense or urgency or organization which has led to at least 10 hours of over time every week but closer to 50 the last four weeks handling the start of a new finical year. I moved into a building where my neighbors frequently smoke substances that trigger my allergies and I've been to the hospital twice for reactions since moving in. On top of that my mother got terrible news about some undetected spine damage she needs a surgery for in the next week. It's been the most trying few months of my life and my 25th birthday was just this looming weight I was dreading. I say to my partner hey my birthday is on a Saturday I'm definitely not working overtime I just want a clean apartment to be in to wear comfy PJs and put the futon in bed mode and take a really good shower and then have the option to nap or lounge anywhere I can whenever I can. With the anyeusm and work I feel like I'm showering every three days and only averaging 3 hours of sleep a night while getting sick having a day to recover was all I wanted.

We did the holiday separate with our families and on Friday my partner texts me ""hey since my mother and stepdad are up from Florida they want to come see the new apartment and the only day they can come is Saturday but it will be a short visit"" ...okay yeah sure I love my in-laws I understand it's a short visit last visit they came for 20 minutes I say since my mom's surgery is coming up I will have to wear a mask the whole time but it's fine. After I approve I get the text ""great also we blew a tire so we can't go home now till tomorrow rather than tonight""... Okay again not super controllable but we didn't blow a tire he did but it's fine I'll get home have the visit get to my plans. He sleeps in Saturday at his father's while I wait alone at my parents house for him unable to reach anyone until 1 pm then we finally get on the road to our apartment at 3 pm I say is the visit cancelled you know my plans are for today and why I wanted today he apologized and said the visits still happening it will be super quick. We get home at 4 pm and he says they were right behind us so I stayunshowered straightening up the apartment that I cleaned for my relaxing day but to my standards not to having guests standards. They don't arrive until 6 pm. I put on my mask to be around them and they laugh about it several times. They show up with food and pies none of which I can eat or even like when I would be able to eat them and proceed to stay until 10 pm. Everytime I used the bathroom (in my apartment) to get sick my partners step father made comments about not being polite around guests (It's a 740 SQ ft apartment they sat at the kitchen bar that while there's a door and a wall is 7 ft away from the toilet). They finally go to leave and I tell my partner while he walks them down I'm going to straighten up and get in the shower he tells me it's rude to not walk them down after I have already not eaten what they brought and gotten sick around them all night no matter how valid my reason is. So I walk them down and in the process step and drag the ankle of my jeans in dog pee on my building lobby's floor. Several jokes about my pee pants ensue before they leave. My partner says he wants to check the mail so I leave to head up to the apartment. I straighten up and as he gets back I'm about ready to get into the shower where he starts to ask me what's up with me and my attitude.

I explain how my day of rest is completely stolen from me and that I'm exhausted and just really need to take off my dog pee jeans and shower and he says I thought you didn't care about your birthday and I don't understand etc and I continue trying to explain that I don't want to celebrate my birthday but if this is the one day a year in my life I'm supposed to have care concern attention and do what I want I still need that one day especially with everything going on and that's when he says ""I was going to put this effort in and decorate and get balloons and try to make you feel special but I was scared of you so I didn't"" and this made me just break down. I told him you realize how shitty it is to tell me that you didn't think I cared about my birthday so it should be fine it was about pleasing everyone but me but then you also follow it up with I was going to make you feel special but I didn't because you're scary. It's just not fair and it's made me feel worse when I already thought I was at my lowest. 

I cried a lot in the shower while he tried to console me and apologize but it didn't make it feel better and when I got out I became wired so I sat on my couch just looking at everything decorating for the holidays to do around the apartment and felt like I was drowning. He them tried to surprise me with my favorite pizza (which is big as he's a vegan and ordered me solely non vegan options that I could eat and have all to myself) but still I am only allowed so much sodium's every day so 1/4 of a slice and I was done unable to touch the sides or anything else and I ended up getting sick ten minutes later so I didn't even really get to keep it in. 

I'm just really stressed out and upset.


Edit to add- Part of my symptoms and side effects of my condition is that I'm just exhausted easily. Sick all the time not getting my usual sleep normal tasks are 5x and hard and in the apartment we have gone from a 50/50 split on all chores to my partner doing pretty much everything. Physically folding laundry is one of the hardest things for me right now and showering is just something I can't do alone now and I hate asking for the help I need. I figured if it was the one thing I was doing that day I would be able to do it alone which is a big peice of why I'm so upset. I am also the main driver in the relationship. It's my car he doesn't even own one and is only on my insurance because if we ever move out of the city it would be an awful rate to have him rejoin and so now with my condition I can't drive at all and the last month has felt like taking a taxi every time I get in my own car. I'm realizing now that maybe I'm a little compulsive and I have habits I hate letting go but how was I supposed to know my in-laws would be the complete opposite of who they normally are and my partner would for the first time ever be just ignorant. I have great relationships with all involved and plan on having the hard conversations as to why anything that happened happened it's just I have so little time and I'm so tired that I don't know when that will be. What I do know is in the meantime I'm going to focus on communicating with my partner and seeing what stopped up here and not texting and relying on his mom the way I normally do because clearly something is up and that doesn't mean I deserve what happened. 

I've also began talking to my partner obviously and as much as he apologizes and has worked to reclean the apartment I explained that it was my one day off that I lost and then to be called scary on top of it just really got to me because I'm in such a bad place. He did clarify that it's referencing in 2017 when he tried to make a big deal out of my birthday and that's the one time we have ever taken a break or had a big fight and I didn't talk to him for two weeks and he thought it was over he is always very jumpy and treads lightly around my birthday to the point where his mother was unaware that it was that date and my partner knows I want it to be treated like a normal day. Overall it was poor communication partly on me due to my tired state and assumption everyone would be normal, but also on everyone else who continually heard me say all I want is to shower and nap and ignored it because it's out of my character.

Edit: thanks for sharing your stories, everyone! I wish I could reply to them all, I had no idea there would be so many!

Tips that I read that will be useful if your find yourself in any of these situations:


RUN LIKE HELL
It’s okay to say “no” if you don’t feel comfortable when a stranger asks you for help. If you have a hard time saying no, try to think about whether you have the materials to help them fix whatever they need help with or if you know how to even fix it, for me, the answer is usually no if I think about it that way.
-if you’re walking alone, keep your phone in your hand and if you feel uneasy about someone  following you, keep 911 dialed just in case they try anything, they will hear the whole conversation. Make sure to yell out where you are, and a description of the man or woman. But most of all, run like hell
Do whatever you can to get out of the situation because if you’re behind closed doors, chances are, you won’t see daylight again. Scream, punch, kick, bite, elbow, anything just fight like hell to get out. 
In these situations, everything you know will “flipping fly out of your head”, do whatever it is that you know in the moment, whether it be freeze, fight, or flee but try to prepare yourself before It ever happens so that you know to fight or flee. If you freeze, scream to the top of your lungs.
Buy a strong pepper spray, they’re not allowed on airplanes  but you can get it at most cornerstores abroad if you ask around.
Don’t stand out, try to fly under the radar if you’re out of the country, don’t make it obvious you don’t speak their language.
ALWAYS trust your gut and be aware of your surroundings
Don’t walk around with headphones, if you do, leave one out and one in or put them in with no music on if you just don’t feel like being bothered.",AskWomen,1116,1573699262.0,591,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/dw2xqg/women_that_have_been_or_almost_been_kidnapped_sex/

[Original]http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14vfku/reddit_women_unmarried_man37_will_be_having_his/

First I want to thank people for their advice on the original thread.  A lot of it was very helpful and it was a self confidence boost to know I was on the right track.  Thanks!

I've never been a particularly emotional guy.  Surely, I know the feeling of love  and I know the joy of a hug from my niece but 6 months ago if someone had told me I'd cry tears in happiness I would have thought them crazy.  As I waited near the baggage claim I had the worst case of butterflies in my entire life.  A first/second date didn't even compare with the turmoil I had going on and as I waited I was able to occupy my mind with every horrible scenario possible for Liz's visit.  Meeting Liz I was greeted with a full on tight hug which, right off the bat, started kicking my emotional butt but then she quickly followed that with a ""I'm so happy to finally get to  hug my Dad.""  It took every ounce of fake man cough I could muster to hold the tears at bay.  I start with this because it pretty much embodies her entire visit.  Between our initial meeting and her departure I had to use the fake cough, clearing of throat or sudden bathroom visit on more than a handful of occasions.  

We did a lot of fun things during her visit.  Went skiing, ice skating, saw a Broadway show.  Lots of firsts for her since she's only lived in a much warmer climate.  I'm glad I was warned about giving her personal time/space.  She wanted her alone time and I probably would have been either worried or annoyed had I not mentally prepared myself ahead of time.  We share a common interest in science and wanted to see where I worked so we spent a day doing that.  I know the parents out there will think ""Well no duhh"" but while visiting my work Liz showed a sincere understanding of a few concepts and I felt such an overwhelming feeling of pride.  I was completely taken off guard by it! 

""I love you"" was finally said the night before her flight home.  Throughout the visit I danced around it a bit to see her reaction but I refused to have her leave without hearing the words.  That evening, as we were scanning in photos I had saved from before I left, I told her about how on several occasions I almost threw these away but could never do it.  The box followed this unsentimental guy through years of grad school, medical school and several moves between different states after that.  More than once I placed it into the garbage only to go and dig it out later because I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to our story together.  I took the opportunity to explain to her how I have a 5 year relationship with her in my memory that she doesn't equally share and because of this I need to tell her that I loved her.  I loved her then and I love her now.   As we sat in silence the moments following and I considered how a better man than myself would not have walked away, regardless of what a stupid DNA test said, I noticed her holding back the tears this time.  

So where does it go from here?  We've decided we're going to see each other monthly even though it's a bit of flying to accomplish it.  She also wants to spend spring break and summer vacation with me and I'm quite excited about it.   After an 11 year gap I'm a Dad again and I love it.

Am I the only woman who doesn't experience much harassment or fear?,"I'm not in ANY way denying that sexual harassment, rape, misogyny, etc. are huge problems in our culture, nor am I suggesting that other women exaggerate their experiences or that they are somehow doing something to bring it on themselves. Please do NOT interpret this in that vein.

It's just... I really can't relate to the refrain of ""I as a woman feel unsafe walking at night/constantly receive unwanted sexual attention/have felt threatened when turning down men"" that #allwomenexceptme are talking about, and I wonder... Am I just really naive and not noticing when it happens? Am I invisible to men for some reason? Am I just too much of a hermit to encounter this? Are there ANY other women out there who feel as I do?

I'm not saying I've NEVER had any such experiences in my whole life...  but they have been so few and far-between that I think of them as isolated incidents, whereas other women talk about harassment/fear as a significant feature of their lived experience.

I went to college in the Boston area.",AskWomen,182,1401256898.0,346,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/26ob1p/am_i_the_only_woman_who_doesnt_experience_much/
"I'm a guy, and witnessed my first incidence of blatant street harassment the other day. I had no idea what to do. What should I have done?","So, the backstory:

I'm in Boston's South Station. A well-put-together dark-skinned woman walks by. A gelatinous, grotesque blob of a pasty white land-whale man-thing starts barking at her. What he says is reasonably tame, considering the stuff I've heard women recount as being said to them by men on the street, but it was still creepy and inappropriate - something to the effect of ""Hey. Hey you. You're beautiful. I love you. Really, you're beautiful. Come here, I wanna talk to you."" 

The woman in question kept walking, visibly affected yet never breaking stride, and calmly exited out the front doors into the rest of Boston like it was nothing out of the ordinary. 

Because the sad truth is: it probably wasn't. 

I realize there's all kinds of issues at work here - the difference in race among them (sexual availability of women of color being assumed as ""open"" and ""insatiable"" by default by white men). But the most salient point in my mind is my own reaction in the heat of the moment, which was to stand there like an idiot and do nothing. 

First of all, it was the first time I had actually seen such a thing happen. You hear about it all the time, but as a guy, you rarely actually *see* it happen so blatantly. Generally it's disguised (guy and a girl walking down the street, guy whispering in her ear, the girl giggling - typical teenage or twenty-something couple out and about? Or did the guy decide that the random girl walking by was hot and is whispering all the depraved things he wants to do to her, and she's just giggling awkwardly so as to not trigger a violent response? Who can tell from a removed perspective?) But in this case there were at least a half-dozen other men around, none of which did or said anything.

In hindsight, my intuition tells me I should have shouted the guy down, yelling at him to shut the hell up, nobody cares about his damned opinion, especially random women on the street that he apparently feels that he can harass at his leisure. 

In the moment, though, after I had come to terms with the fact that yes, this is really a thing that is happening (which was after the whole thing had ended, because the whole incident took *maybe* 10 seconds from start to finish), it felt like white-knighting. Like ""Fear not, fair maiden, for I, mooseinduced, will come to thy rescue and defend thine honor because it is a foregone conclusion that you are incapable of defending it yourself."" 

So what do you think? Was my intuition correct? Or should I have done something different? The ""Stand there like an idiot and do nothing"" thing seems like a terrible reaction, and I want to do better the next time I'm confronted with such a situation.

"Women of the world, how do I stop scaring women?","I figured this title would catch your attention.

A bit of background: I'm a pretty big guy, about two metres tall, kind of wide, big hair, etc. I live out in the suburbs and I have to travel with the bus, followed by a short walk through a fairly dark street. At least once a week, I end up walking on that path with a random woman who immediately starts showing signs of fear and/or discomfort (a lot of looks behind her shoulder, quickened pace, pulling out her cell phone without actually using it, etc.). In a few cases, the women have turned out to be my neighbours which freaks them out when I follow them into the neighbourhood. I don't necessarily blame them, because, like I said, I may be seen as an imposing figure, but, if you ask any woman who knows me well enough, they will tell you (even though this term has been co-opted by assholes) that I am a nice guy who would never harm anyone (I am also a feminist, if that helps). It would be difficult to convince them of that though. I sometimes try to overtake them, but that tended to heighten things; in one case, some random woman actually turned around to confront me! Is there anything that I can do to avoid this, other than staying home? I mean, I do have feelings too and if I get looked at like I'm a monster one more time, I swear I will run into traffic!

How can I stop my female friends from cock-blocking me? ,"It's getting out of hand. (M25)

Most recently: New Year's Eve. 

My friends and I went to a fancy New Year's Eve charity event downtown, and I went 'stag'. I didn't want to be alone at midnight, so I went to the bar and started talking to people. I met a very interesting girl, who also didn't have anyone to kiss at midnight. We absolutely 'clicked', it was amazing. It was one of those conversations that make guys remember why we don't just buy a fleshlight and register a Brazzers account. You know those types of conversations? They're great. 

[Not this](http://qkme.me/3sg3m5)

Needless to say, while I had only known this girl for ~20 minutes, I was excited I had met someone fun but was scared to invite her to the table my group was at.  After a few more minutes, one of her girlfriends came over and stole her to go to the bathroom to do whatever the hell it is that you do in there. I assume it is anything but pee. I gave her a hug and told her if she didn't meet me at my table in 10 minutes I would send out a search party. Add a few seconds of good eye contact, and she was pulled away. 

At this point, I'm standing there in a suit, watching her walk away, and pretty much feeling like that Marlon Brando gif I've seen on r/ladyboners 1,000 times. 

I leave the bar and maneuver through the heathens to the other side of the venue, where my group had reserved a table. There was a mix of girls in relationships, and single girls, all of whom I know well and age from 22-25. I love them to death, but they're very 'protective'. So when my new friend returns from the bathroom, my friends go from being absolute sweethearts to some sort of mother bear clan who is protecting their cub from a nuclear charged alligator. My new friend comes up to me and put her arm around me, I return the favor and give her a quick side hug. In the two seconds the hug took place, body language changed. 

My friends now enter momma bear mode, and became much more flirty with me. All of this was to intimidate the new girl. They would come up and pull my tie, fix my collar, put their phone in my pocket, etc.,  basically raising the level of physical contact. This, of course, made my new friend feel uncomfortable, and this was not the first time. They have scared other girls off before, and justified it by saying it's because they didn't like them and thought they were wrong for me. Out of the women I introduce to them, some are too bitchy, some are too fake, too tall, too short, too tan, too red-headed, etc. 

I find it endearing, and appreciate that they care about me that much, but holy shit, I'm 25, I'm not looking for a wife tomorrow. I've told them this, and they said they will stop when I find a nice girl that they can trust around me. So far that has been 1 person in the last 4 years, and of course she moved to Kansas. I value their input on girls that I'm considering dating, but if it's some girl I met at a bar and neither of us have dating intentions, I don't see why my friends need to be so judgmental. As my friends, shouldn't they be guiding my cock? Not blocking it? 

I have talked to them about it, and this post is basically a transcript of what I told them. But they continue to shamelessly do it. 

Apart from the obvious 'don't bring one-night-stands around you friends', how can I communicate with them that they need to stop intentionally preventing me from being around other women? 


TL;DR - My female friends intentionally scare away all of my potential hookups. How do I keep them from cock blocking me?

I'm conscious that when I'm on the street late at night my presence can make some women feel uncomfortable (sad but true fact).

&amp;#x200B;

Some topics to consider:

\- men acting less aggressive and/or more actively seeking consent when moving in for the kiss, taking clothes off, etc.

\- men engaging in less (or maybe more) catcalls and street harassment

\- men avoiding women at work in professional and/or social contexts (i.e. following the Mike Pence rule, not going out with female co-workers to happy hour, etc.)

\- men being less likely to make a move on female co-workers/subordinates

\- more generally, men being less likely to flirt with women in non-workplace situations. Some guys on Reddit claim they're avoiding women now, but I have a feeling that's just typical Reddit whining rather than a broader trend among men in general. But who knows.

"That awkward path crossing at night; do large men make you feel threatened or otherwise uncomfortable, and is there anything we can do about it?","Last night, I was walking home from class around 9:45pm. I walk down a long sidewalk with a portion covered by low hanging trees that block out the street light. A petite woman exits her car and walks towards me. I feel the night masks my complete lack of interest in her and that she might feel threatened by my presence. My attempt at a friendly greeting comes out as a gravely and gruff ""hi,"" that sounds scary to me. She says ""hi"" back in a more upbeat voice and the encounter ends as I walk away.

My question is, what can I do to make strangers know I'm just trying to get home and feel more comfortable? Should I hold myself a certain way, keep hands out of pockets, say or not say anything? BTW I'm white, 6'1"", and 220lb (185cm 99kg). 

Edit: Some women are cool with a brisk hello, and others want you to ignore them as much as possible. Always keep your distance, avoid making eye contact, don't sneak up on them, don't give the appearance of chasing them if you're behind them (some like you to say, ""excuse me, I'm going to pass you""), don't attempt a conversation, and if you have a call to make, now is a good time.",AskWomen,73,1373642582.0,129,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1i5o86/that_awkward_path_crossing_at_night_do_large_men/
Ever met a guy that was TOO perfect? ,"I met this guy, totally out of my league, hot, fit, kind, funny. So naturally I fucked him. Turns out he doesn't only have a nice big BEAUTIFUL dick but he also is a deviant god. So fucking dominant. He knows how to do bondage properly and beautifully, he takes his time fucking me... I mean dude, you have no idea how hard it is to find that combo. And he finds me attractive. Like awesome right? Well...I dunno. I Mean HES JUST SOOOOO HOLLYWOOD. That's the best way I can describe it. Here, I'll tell you about a bunch of things he does that really shouldn't happen in real life:


**(1)** Usually before or after we fuck he looks at me up and down while I'm naked, stares at me deeply and says ""You're beautiful you know that?"" or ""You're so fucking beautiful"". Now... I get I should be stoked. Like ""Dude he's complimenting you"" right? But.. I'm an overweight out of shape south american woman. That shit ain't pretty, sister. **I know I'm more than fuckable** but the way he says it just sounds sooo...sooo.. ugh.. I dunno. Do you understand what I'm saying? Like if you had acne and someone came up to you and said you have an awesome skin...

**(2)** Walking alone at night. I think I had said something about liking to eat and I might have described what I think is a perfect burger. so he stops me, tilts my head up by touching my chin and kisses me passionetely. Again ""Dude...that sounds like AWESOME"" ....well then why am I feeling so...WEIRD? It's just ODD! Right? Am I the only one?


**(3)** He picks me up. The first time I told him: ""Yo! You'll probably get a hernia if you pick me up. And all that extra space between me and the floor if you hold me up here is just confusing to me, I'm constantly panicking that you're going to break your back and that I'll be charged with manslaughter.""  He laughed and very dominantly told me to ""Shut the fuck up"" and refused to put me down and started kissing me. So again you'd think ""Dude! why are you complaining he's awesome"" and maybe if there was a film crewe filming us it would be but there wasn't and I. Did not. Like it. I DUNNO WHY! WHYY????? Why don't I feel comfortable about this?

**(4)** He kisses my forehead. Says stuff like ""You know, I like you. And not just because of the sex. I REALLY like you"" with that smolder look he has most of the time. Something Like [this](http://imgur.com/B0P0O) a bit more serious. He likes to cuddle, He has awesome stamina, he smells good, He trims his pubes, his balls smell nice and clean all the time, his feet don't smell, He even owns a bike with all the attire, he is great with children and loves them too, he doesn't mind period sex, we have nothing yet so much in common, we have the same sense of humour.

I even farted infront of him and he didn't even flinch he looked at me smiled and said ""Good one"". I Laughed my embarrassment away and then he let one rip aswell followed by a ""I win"". Not only is that total badass but I love that he actually tried to make it the least embarrasing for me too. He's just such a gentleman. 

WHY DO I FIND IT SO OFFPUTTING THEN???????????? I told all my friends this and they think I'm overreacting...but it's driving me mad that I can't find ONE thing wrong with him. We've been dating for 6 weeks now and I somehow don't like him! I DUNNNO! I DUNNO WHY!! WHY?? I mean. 

***WHY CANT I LIKE HIM?????***

"Ladies, what's your go-to self-defense tactics or tips?","Last night as I was waiting for my bf in my car outside of his house, a random car kept slowly passing me by driving up and down the street. They were swerving and slowed down especially while passing next to my side of the window. This happened a few times until they parked in front of me. I couldn't look up (because I was a big chicken) but they had a perfect view of me with their headlights shining directly on my face. Of course once my bf came walking out the car casually drove away. Regardless, nothing felt right about that. 

Although nothing happened, and I may be thinking too far into this, I still felt like a helpless sitting duck. I'm 5'2"", small and thin. It doesn't help that my leg is currently injured, and that I'm fairly attractive and a very anxious person. I'm not too sure how to handle situations like this (or far worse) in the future if I'm in dire need to protect myself or someone else. I can't imagine what it's like to actually be confronted or assaulted by someone while being completely alone.

UPDATE: How should a transgender man approach a woman without freaking her out or scaring her off?,"Alright, so my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/wdzha/how_should_a_transgender_man_approach_a_woman/) was made over 9 months ago. A lot has happened since then, some good stuff and some not so good stuff, but in the end mostly good stuff...

A summary of my last post: I was born with a female body but I am a man, which makes me a transgender man (FTM); though to be accurate and honest, I mostly reject my trans-ness and identify as a man. Plain and simple. After a pretty shitty relationship and break up I decided to start dating again but didn’t know how to approach the issue of being transgender. I am very comfortable with my body and have a strong preference for straight, very feminine women. This preference had not worked out well for me so far and lead me to get turned down a lot. My question to /r/AskWomen was how I could approach women and inform them of my “situation” without putting them off or scaring them off.

Alright, so how have the last 9 months gone?

Well, not too long after I made that post I kind of got into a friends with benefits situation with an ex-girlfriend of mine from college. We provided each other with a lot of emotional support and had sex whenever I was in town (it was long distance, but she is going to school in my hometown so I visited frequently). It was mostly a crutch and it wasn’t a very satisfying sexual relationship. I fapped a lot, per usual.

While I was doing that whole FWB thing, up until the new year, I was keeping my eye open to possibilities. I started getting out of my shell a lot more, which was a challenge in and of itself, being in a new city and all. I would go out with my friends to break dancing clubs, burlesque shows, out to see local DJs and bands play, and just out to the bars. Basically, if there was something I wanted to do or see or experience,  I wouldn’t hesitate to do/see/experience it. I treated approaching women the same way. If there was a woman that caught my eye I would approach her, buy her a drink, be suave and shit and I usually had a good conversation but didn’t feel enough of a connection to pursue it further. This might be because I wasn’t ready or because I my FWB crutch or because the girls just really weren’t all that great, who knows, but regardless nothing came of those adventures.

Well, I wouldn’t say that nothing came of it. I got really good at just talking to women and ordering drinks and becoming friends with everyone, especially bartenders. Not to mention, I got to hang out with some of my friends and do cool shit, and doing cool shit is fun.

**Relationship # 1**

But one of my friends really wanted to set me up with her best friend. I was pretty skeptical about this from the beginning. Basically, I had hung out with this girl a few times at the bar or at a party and small talk was fine but she didn’t seem that, well, deep. Another thing, she mostly dates women. But, after my original post, I was more open to the idea of dating bisexual women.

So, because this woman was a friend of a friend, she was already privy to the plumbing in my pants, if you follow me. No mystery, there. New Years Eve rolls around and we basically double date with our mutual friend. I kiss her at midnight, get her number, pay her tab, get wasted, dry out, and drive home. We make plans to go on a few dates and do. I do my lady-killer moves and she’s just... blah. Eventually we have sex and the first time it was good, and after that it was awful. The worst kind of dead fish situation. I’m not sure if she was intimidated or nervous, but she was never open to communication so it just sucked. 

I should have listened to my gut to begin with. I honestly don’t think she’s into guys and I think she has a misconception about what it would be like dating a transman. I am not at all some kind of androgynous, embrace-my-femininity kind of guy; I have all of the best and worst parts of being a man and I really don’t think she was into any of that. But hey, we all have preferences and I wasn’t hers and she wasn’t mine. By the time I realized that I was done it was less than a week before Valentines Day, so I decided to wait until after to break it off. Big mistake. She got weird and clingy and distant all at the same time and it was a bad two weeks. It’s over though, so, *whew.*

When I realized that I was consistently dating this woman from NYE I had told my FWB that I was seeing someone and didn’t want either of them to get the wrong idea about the situation, meaning that I ended the FWB thing. But then, once things ended with the NYE woman I started talking to my FWB again.

**Relationship # 2**

This whole time I had an account on OKCupid, with nothing in my profile to suggest that I’m a transman. I opened the account when I was still in college, trying to meet people to hang out with once I moved, but no one ever messaged me (which was frustrating) and no one ever messaged me back (which is even more frustrating). I was only checking it about once a week for shits and giggles and getting back into the concerts, bars, and burlesque show routine, but then I got this message from this woman with awesome dimples and a beautiful smile. She actually messaged me about Reddit, of all things, and I later found out that she had searched specifically for redditors (so thank you, reddit, for doing me a solid there). 

Within two days out brief messages became pages long and we set up a date. Wasting no time! Based on our profiles and messages, it was inevitable that we would click right away, and of course we did. I took her out to a nice dinner, wine and dined her, did all my lady-killer moves and everything. Even though I was hella nervous (and so was she) we both had a great time. I kind of got ahead of myself and went for the kill. I asked her if I could kiss her, she said yes, and I did. I hadn’t disclosed yet that I was trans. I got back into my car and was basically yelling at myself. I had given myself that one rule: no physical intimacy before disclosure, based on my original post, and I broke it. This was the only time I broke that rule, and damned if I was going to let that one mistake ruin the first true connection I’ve ever felt with a woman. (And this would be where I broke it off with my FWB for the second time, though she didn't get the hint and I had to spell it out for her a week later.)

I knew I needed to tell her but I was pretty nervous about the whole thing. I ended up looking at her OKCupid profile again just to check if she had answered the ""Would you date a transgender person?"" question. Yeah, that question exists, and yeah, she did answer it. She had said ""no"". Well, damn. But I couldn't ignore the connection we had, and an answer on an online dating profile isn't a real answer or rejection, so I decided to just tell her and see where it went anyway.

So, we talk again the next day, and everything is great. Then I got super distant for a while (like half of a day). I needed to tell her, since we were *thiiiis close* to planning our second date. I actually have the text messages from when I told her:

&gt; **Ronald:** Damn you beat me to it! I was going to ask you but I was cleaning my shower (it was awful). But yes. We should. Before we go ahead making plans I just wanted to tell you something. It's not a big deal to me but I want to be open and honest with you. I'm a trans guy.

&gt; **Girl:** That's legit. I appreciate you telling me. That's awesome that you're so chill about it.
It's not something I would go actively searching for, but its not a deal breaker either. I'm probably technically bisexual, though I've never acted on it. 

&gt; **Ronald:** Welp. That's fantastic. So, where to tomorrow?
(feel free to ask me anything, btw. I'm pretty open about it once I break the stealth seal)

&gt; **Girl:** Where to? I'm up for whatever. I had Thai tonight though, so I would prefer not that! :P
How long have you been on hormones? I'm assuming you must be? I don't know much about this whole thing. What kind of things do people normally ask? :)

And that’s basically how it went. I walked her through the bigger topics, she asked questions, I gave answers, and mostly we planned our second date. We saw a comedy show and had pizza. It was nice. She also slept over that night because we just didn’t want to be done with the date, though clothes stayed on.

Sex happend on date number three, which was a mellow night at my apartment. That was also the night that I asked her to be my girlfriend. Basically, all of my trans stuff was a non-issue for her. I think this has a lot to do with my honesty and openness, and pretty much where I am in my life and transition. I think that if I was insecure with myself then she would have reacted differently. I think our success together has a lot to do with our mutual timing; she was finally in a good place with her stuff, I was finally in a good place with my stuff, and it just worked. When she mentioned being “bisexual” she was more-so referencing being attracted to masculine people, regardless of genitalia. She has never date women or been in a relationship with a woman. She’s only ever treated me as a man and I have never felt more comfortable in my role in a relationship.

We’re still dating. It’s been two months, two of the most amazing months. Not only is all of the emotional and gooey shit fantastic, but the sex is amazing. We recently incorporated a prosthetic for me (read: strap on), and it’s given a whole new and exciting dynamic to sexy time.

So, yeah. That’s been my exploits for the last 9 months. I’m up for answering questions (in comments or PMs) so feel free! 

**TL;DR** Fuck you. I just spent a long time writing that, go read it!

EDIT 1: I just want to thank everyone for the positive response to this post. I know a lot of other trans guys also appreciate the fact that so many people understand why it's importnat to recognize the good stuff and to talk about it. My girlfriend ([TheDukesMistress](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1dtjok/update_how_should_a_transgender_man_approach_a/c9tt0e1)) also really enjoyed chiming in and adding her perspective.

It also linked to this artcle about people telling women to smile. http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/12/2614421/stop-telling-women-smile/
I am trying to educate myself here, as I cannot fathom someone demanding a smile, let alone harassing them about it. A suggestion, maybe, but I do not believe I have personally even done that. I have however had both men and women suggest I smile, as I am pretty much cronically stoic. I never felt like they were being demanding. 

So in short, I am just trying to get some women's experiences and perspectives on this.

How scary is it being alone as a woman?,I don't mean loneliness but rather being by yourself with no one around. I hear it time and time again that women are cautious about going out alone for fear of harassment or worse. Is it really that bad or is it somewhat overblown?

"Ladies, how would you react if the cute guy you pass on the street, then make eye contact and smile at, actually stopped and said something or justed asked for your number?","So this is purely hypothetical, and is something that I've recently been wondering. I moved to San Francisco 6 months ago and the amount of beautiful girls here is staggering. I just turned twenty one a few days ago so I'm getting into the bar scene, etc. 

I've met a lot of girls in the parks, including a girl I dated for 3 months,    But we always hang out, drink and smoke for a few hours. I recently cut my hair, and as happened last time I did this, I've consciously been noticing more girls looking at me, smiling, etc. I'm no model, but I like the way I look, and I catch a lot of girls passing me on the street. I feel like it would be creepy or strange to actually just stop and say ""hey, you're cute, and we haven't spoken yet, but we should at some point."" 

As far as I know, no one has ever successfully done this, but then again, no one I know has ever tried.

**EDIT: You wise women know your stuff. So yesterday I made a few of the little note cards, with my name, number, and with a different little phrase of how they had caught my eye on each.

 Girl #1 was in the Castro Street station, a really cute Asian girl who was trading subtle smiles with me as we waited for our respective trains, since she was across the tracks. Even if I crumpled it up it wouldn't make it over the tracks, though this did little to deter me. I took out a pen from my bag, unrolled it, put the note inside, and waited for one of our trains to come. Mine did first, so just as it neared the tunnel I smiled openly at her and threw the pen underhand over the tracks at her. I smiled at her till the train blocked my view, and when I got out of the tunnel a few stops later, there was a new text. #1 said I made her smile, and invited me to a place she interns at tomorrow for free beer and tacos. Excellent things, indeed. 

Girl #2 was my moment of truth. A beautiful dark brunette who I walked past on Valencia street. She was on the other side of the crosswalk and we both waited for the signal. I decided to just say fuck it and take another note out of my pocket, and smiled at her as I passed her and gave it to her, saying I liked her shoes, which I truthfully did, being Gladiatorial and such. About an hour later, she texted me saying that that had never happened to her and it was kinda weird, though flattering, but she was single and was down to meet a bar this weekend. Reddit, how did I not know this before?

Girl #3, who will be spoken of again soon, was on the bus, an adorable strawberry blonde who I was way more confident about smiling at and meeting her eye after the earlier success. But she didn't shy from it, and giggled a few times, and whispered to her friend. When I got off, I handed her a note and told her that it was 'for her eyes only'. Kinda lame, yes, but she called me not a minute later, asking what I was doing that night, and invited me to a birthday party for her friend. I told her probably yeah, if she texted me the address. She said she would, and sure enough, at nine that night, I got an address over in the Haight, and headed over. I woke up at #3's place in the sunset, let's just say I couldn't wait to see her again. Which was later today for a smoke and a walk round the taco trucks.

Girl #4 was a blonde girl I passed on Market street and just decided to give her my last note as I passed. Strange look, and no texts. I got a laugh at her face though, so i still win.   ",AskWomen,40,1348540630.0,84,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10ffz5/ladies_how_would_you_react_if_the_cute_guy_you/
How do you deal with unwanted attention?,"I'm 17 and have recently started a job as a till assistant at a popular fast food chain. I also usually finish shifts at around 10 on Friday and Saturday nights and while it's a very short walk to where I get a lift home, I have to walk past several pubs and nightclubs. I've recently had some interactions with people that have made me incredibly uncomfortable, such as a man following me then asking me a load of personal questions and failing to leave me alone when it was clear I didn't want to interact with him.

I'm also 5""2 and about 100lbs and can often be socially awkward as well as looking a few years older. I could probably convince quite a few people I'm around 19.

SUMMARY ABOUT THE BOOKS CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO CARES

**The Handmaid's Tale** - Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now..

**A Brave New World** - Far in the future, the World Controllers have created the ideal society. Through clever use of genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational sex and drugs, all its members are happy consumers. Bernard Marx seems alone harbouring an ill-defined longing to break free. A visit to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old, imperfect life still continues, may be the cure for his 
distress...

**Oryx &amp; Crake** - Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by a plague, is struggling to survive in a world where he may be the last human, and mourning the loss of his best friend, Crake, and the beautiful and elusive Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey–with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake–through the lush wilderness that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride.

**The Road** - A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other

**Never Let Me Go** - In one of the most acclaimed and strange novels of recent years, Kazuo Ishiguro imagines the lives of a group of students growing up in a darkly skewered version of contemporary England. Narrated by Kathy, now 31, Never Let Me Go hauntingly dramatises her attempts to come to terms with her childhood at the seemingly idyllic Hailsham School, and with the fate that has always awaited her and her closest friends in the wider world. A story of love, friendship and memory, Never Let Me Go is charged throughout with a sense of the fragility of life.

**Galápagos** - Galápagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Galápagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race. In this inimitable novel, America’s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry–and all that is worth saving

**Wool** - n a ruined and hostile landscape, in a future few have been unlucky enough to survive, a community exists in a giant underground silo. Inside, men and women live an enclosed life full of rules and regulations, of secrets and lies.To live, you must follow the rules. But some don't. These are the dangerous ones; these are the people who dare to hope and dream, and who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple and deadly. They are allowed outside. Jules is one of these people. She may well be the last.

**Earth Abides** - Before the first page the human race has been almost completely wiped out by plague. Our hero Isherwood ""Ish"" Williams discovers a female survivor and fumblingly tries to bring up a new civilization in the ruins of California. It's an elegiac story of loss as humanity makes it through the crisis, at the cost of our race's painfully gathered knowledge--which seems irrelevant to the new generations as they develop a hunter-gatherer society reminiscent of the old Amerindian tribes, and see no practicality in the fabulous tales of the old days told them by Ish

I hate that I feel the need to dress differently just so guys ignore me but if I'm ever in a dress I get honked at and yelled at from cars and I'm just so scared every time I leave the house. 

Mace and pepper spray are illegal here in Australia, so I carry spray deodorant, a lighter (flame thrower) and a pen around just in case. I know I'm paranoid, I'm just very distrusting of people.

"Ladies, how do you feel about a man approaching you while you're walking alone?","A little context here. Recently I was walking to work in the middle of the afternoon when an older man (Older as in late 30's or 40's... I'm in my early 20's) honked at me, rounded the block, and tried to block me off at a residential street. He began trying to get me to come over and when I pulled out my pepper spray and began to walk faster, He told me to put a smile on my face. At this point I turned around and threatened him with my keys yelling that I would call the police. He sat there for a minute and slowly turned and drove past me. After the adrenaline wore off I began to wonder if that wasn't an over-reaction.

Until less than 24 hours later, I decided to take a walk down the neighborhood bike path with my camera just for fun. While I was photographing things, a somewhat unkempt looking man in his late 40's approached me from off the path(very quickly may I add) and started repeatedly asking ""What do you see?"" Needless to say he startled the living hell out of me, and I stammered while trying to tell him to stay away. He kept coming towards me and honestly I was in such a ""fight or flight"" mode I don't remember what I did that made him back off. Either way I was terrified.

In my experience it's an unwritten law that you just DON'T approach a woman walking alone, especially if she's half your age, and ESPECIALLY if she doesn't see you coming. I was also always taught that an overreaction is better than an underreaction in these situations so that anyone nearby is alerted to what may happen.

I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid about this sort of thing or if this is the right way to go. How do you handle these situations?

EDIT: I appreciate every one of your responses! Thank you! I feel like I learned a few new things and I hope others did too!",AskWomen,27,1380249608.0,59,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1n80mb/ladies_how_do_you_feel_about_a_man_approaching/
Are women romantically and sexually attracted to men? Essay long serious question from inexperienced nerd guy.,"Edit. I put in a TL;DR at the bottom now.

If you think the title is a joke then no I am just clueless. Quick backstory so you know why I have to post this.

I have been a shut in nerd for over 20 years. The live in mom's basement type. But it is really my room on the upstairs, not a basement, and it is not a basement for my buddies either. Take it from the source.

Next I have never dated much less talked to a non-family member girl for very long. Yes in my whole life. All home schooling, in childhood I was kept away from children because they could have got me into smoking or drinking and crap like that, and I live on online games right now as much as I did the past 10 years.

Next all the women in my family have divorced or otherwise unhappy marriages where they claim to not love or be attracted to him and stay with him for the kids.

Last is the big one. When I say all the women I mean my mother too. We have talked about it in detail and yes I am alive and my siblings are alive not because of sexual, physical, romantic, emotional attraction at all. Wtf? Is this common? Do not think bad of her please. She said she just wanted a family and I am totally sure she isnt a lesbian or bi at all because I asked. And apparently not straight?

Now that you see where I am coming from, hear my plight. From my own learning about the world, women do not seem attracted to men, for the same reasons men such as me are attracted to women. I fantasize about passionate romantic love and someone to come home to and want to spend time and her life with me as much as I do her. I am not strongly sexual. But I know I am not asexual, gay, bi, pan. Sex would do NOTHING for me if it was a one way street. Me being interested hinges on her feeling the same way about me.

Recently I joined okcupid too, a month ago. I did not send any messages yet, please understand baby steps and it took a lot to join. It seems women do not message men on there. And it seems most men just message with sup and are seeking casual sex. These are accurate suspicions you think? Anyways I will definately not meet women IRL. I don't drink and do drugs or go to bars. I don't like the idea honestly of joining a hobby club of a thing like dancing or yoga or things just to meet women as the primary goal. I am not like most men who just want to pick up ""chicks"" and use them.

It probably is good to mention most of the women I would message on okcupid are listed as bi. I do not know what to make of that, because why would they pick me over a cute girl. Are all women bi a little bit even if they say straight? Sorry to ask that but I am that clueless. I am not Brad Pitt, I am just a guy. Brad Pitt posting this would be real funny though. But yes I am not fat with a disgusting neck beard, I take care of my body, and don't wear fedoras and that crap. But why would I assume that a girl could be physically attracted to me when I have never been told otherwise, and never learned otherwise.

If you read this far and wonder how to help or what to say at all, let me try to make questions.

1, what do you think of all this. Am I crazy? Or does it make sense for me to feel this unsure. Just because I am attracted to women does not mean I can infer they could be attracted to me.

2, are you romantically attracted to men? Like passionate true love and that crap in the movies. A spark and true feelings as deep for him as he can have for you, instead of ONLY being with a man for life companionship the way you would see a coworker or someone in your military platoon where it is just a job. A team mate in a game if you will, the game of life. A team mate you do not love but you are good at working with even if there are no deep romantic love feelings.

3, are you sexually attracted to men? Physical sexual interest the way I think a girl is cute and I would do anything sexual she asked me, even if it is better if we are in love. And yes then also emotional sexual attraction like sharing the act with your soul mate or ""the one"" if that means anything other than Keanu Reeves. I know I am sexually drawn to women, but less now than younger, but let me tell you puberty was hard sh!t to go through alone in your room. I talked to a couple girls on yahoo messenger teen chats for a few minutes and most or all had boyfriends or girlfriends. I made it a goal to lose virginity before age 14 thinking sex was a big damn deal. Here I am in my middle 20's and much sadder about lonelyness and no love than no sex. :(

4, are you attracted to men in other ways than those 2 ways? Things like life companion, being supported with a house and money, raising children with a man that is fit enough to be not a train wreck father, being protected from other people and things. Though the last one is some ancient instinct from the cavemen era mostly isn't it.

5, I do not think it's bad to be attracted in non love and sex ways from all possibilities in question 4. But, am I correct in guessing some women do not have love or sex attraction and only are attracted for question 4 reasons like child and family raising, or money, or boredom or who the hell knows. If yes is there any way to avoid becoming involved with women like that. I am deathly afraid of being used by someone I would fall in love with and they lack any love or attraction for me. Scared enough that if I dont make baby steps like this post and okcupid account, I can be a movie subject like the 40 year old virgin.

6, if you read this far then thank you for dealing with my confusion. Is there any other way or things you can explain that would help with my fears besides these questions? They are just some big questions I don't know any answer to, at least answers I believe deep down, but I am all ears with learning anything you girls can tell me or link me. I will read all comments and any linked material to anything.

Please if you reply just read this part, I do not need to be told I am hopeless, and a moron, and that of course I a heterosexual man cannot see why anyone would want to be with a man, or that individual women answering cannot help me and that I should instead seek professional help from a therapist and those guys. They would waste my time I feel, and I don't want to talk to guys who are paid to give me an answer like ""women are attracted to men obviously because of biology unless they are lesbian"", and what would they tell me that women in here actually interested in helping with this post and my issues could not do. Everything there is to know in life, everyone has to learn somewhere and in their own way remember.

Man I hope this isn't deleted because I spent 3 hours on it and honest to God not asking for dating and relationship advice, or medical help. And I don't think I broke other rules like I am not a misogynist. I am very intrigued by and just confused by women and obviously or so I hope it's obvious, very very inexperienced, and curious. Maybe I seem very creepy, or sexist or some crap. But trust me I would never hurt a girl physically or emotionally. I am the annoying inexperienced chivalrous white knight behind the computer screen with all his online RPG buddies and no girls in our guild. No I didn't scare them off. At least I don't think I did because I don't talk to girls even in games lol. :(

I love anonymity so I can if people reply potentially learn things in a non embarrassing way since I can use a throw away account. Damn long post though sorry for telling my life story but I figured it would shed light on why I am earnestly asking the questions that I am.

TL;DR. Women in my family including mother say no sex or love, just other reasons to marry. I was home schooled and only play online games with other guys for the extent of my social life. I have built up many fears and because of my life so far I have not convinced myself a girl can love me the way I feel I would love her in romantic and emotional way, and that she could be sexually and physically attracted to me the way I am to her. I am scared of being used in any way like a throw away husband for providing anything from money to children. I do not want anything close to prostitution ever and I am morally against that ""profession."" I am also confused if all women are bi even if they say straight and if so why would they pick me over a girl. I feel that advice from real women and answers to these life long questions will help more than referring me to ""professional help"" which sorry but in this case I feel would be a waste of my time and money to talk to someone about.",AskWomen,0,1406036108.0,57,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2be5l8/are_women_romantically_and_sexually_attracted_to/

When running at night how should I alert women to my presence while approaching from behind?,"I am a man and I often run in my neighborhood around 4 or 5 am.  I live in an old neighborhood with almost no street lights so it is genuinely dark winter or summer.  While running or cooling down, I occasionally see women who are walking their dog, getting the paper or who are also walking/running.  Sometimes these women are even in their bathrobes.  

Many times I am running up behind them and I wrestle with how best to announce myself.  I always cross to the other side of the street first, but I still need to let them know I'm coming.  I worry that if I scuff my feet from far away they will think I am running at them (because it's so dark).  Meanwhile if I scuff my feet near them they may be startled that a man has suddenly appeared.

So far I wait until I am about 25 ft behind them on the other side of the street, scuff my feet and then say ""Good Morning!"" in as cheerful and nonthreatening voice as I can (think Ned Flanders) when they turn.  This seems to work sometimes, but other times they gasp and clutch their chests.  Perhaps serial killers sound like Ned Flanders too. 

What should I do instead?

Edit:  Thanks for the suggestions and comments.  I'll try the ""on your left"" thing since it immediately says ""I'm running/biking for exercise"" and may orient the person more quickly.  I should probably also wear some sort of safety vest, belt or miner's light (I saw a woman running this morning with one!), but it hasn't been an issue at that time of day.

"Women of reddit, do you think it's right to be taught / told to not confront people who harass you on the street? Why or why not?","I was talking to my co-workers (2 females) about catcalling today and how surprised I was that people are telling women that they should not confront a person who is harassing them on the street. I, for one, absolutely believe that all women have the freedom to respond to catcalling in whatever way they would like, whether responding positively, simply ignoring it and walking away, or giving them their piece of mind. Would I prefer more women to tell the harassers that they do not appreciate it? Absolutely. 

My co-workers did not agree with me at all. They said that it is crazy to confront someone who is in the state of mind to be harassing women on the street, whether it is ""Hey babymama"" or more profrane things. Their reasoning was the following: 1) the person is crazy and could turn violent 2) what if the confrontation sets them off and it ends with rape, death, or assault 3) what if they are set off and in anger rape, kill or assault another person and 4) they will completely disregard everything that is said, so the purpose is lost. 

I wouldn't mind if the above was just their personal opinion, but they believed that no women should ever be confrontational in this situation and urged me to do the same. I've had a couple of other people say the same thing as well, whether through a forum, thread, or in person. 

I am very curious as to what you have to say. ~~Does the possibility of violent behavior pose such a threat?~~ Does the possibility of violent behavior pose such a threat that all women should stay their silence in every situation of street harassment? Do you also teach girls and women that they should stay silent in these circumstances?

Unlike most people, when I'm walking about in public going somewhere I don't have my face buried in my phone and like to people watch men and women to pass the time. I've noticed a couple odd behaviors from women. Say when I am coming to within 30 feet of a woman walking the other way, if I even move my pupils to the side of my vision where she is, I'll often see her instantly take out or raise her phone to her face or ear and pretend she just got a text or call. Or a woman walking in front of me might briefly prop open a door for me and afterwards I'll be walking behind her because we're heading to the same place in the gym/shopping area. After about 20 feet of this, sometimes I'll see her take an abrupt turn left or right and stop so that I pass. Often, they'll end up facing a blank wall for some time when they do this and looking back it's quite comical as they seem glued to a wall for no reason...

Certainly, these aren't the only tactics and this doesn't happen all the time; sometimes they make eye contact and smile or look down and smile,etc. I am below average height for my race, so, certainly, I realize a good % of women will immediately find me repulsive w/o needing to see my face or how I dress and that that is the trigger for these avoidance behaviors. That's fine - what I really want to know about this is how much introspective access women have in this area.

Those of you that are consciously aware that you employ these tactics, are you actively thinking of everything that triggers it? Do you remember when you started using these tactics and it is something you feel you absolutely need to do to avoid problems or is it more that doing it makes you feel desired and wanted - i.e. I have to fend off all these men in otherwise safe public areas that maybe might hit on me? Or do you partition out sections of time as 'I want to meet men' or 'absolutely don't want; very bad if I have to maybe deal with one' and toggle the avoidance tactics accoringly?

__________________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: So, what I've gathered is that women or at least the women of AskWomen really, really hate strangers in public and want no interaction with them whatsoever, especially if they're male. OK. 

I've also read the 'creepy' FAQ on here and thinking back to my home country men do approach strange women in public far more often and overwhelmingly in the not 'creepy' way. I just don't remember the guys often being nervous, stammering, and talking too fast or the girls looking frightened, shocked, and apprehensive. However, unlike the explanation given by one of the posters below it's also the case that the girls are FAR more assertive. They'll hint and then definitely WILL abruptly walk away or WILL scathingly tell you off if you're starting to annoy them.

Another input is that in my home country it is just that people are much less often in huge rushes in public. Part of this is dilution by all the women and men that just go on strolls more often and often alone in the parks, the shopping areas, and even boring streets too. They sit around in the cafes drinking a coffee alone more often than here and with no particular task. Unlike another poster's reply below, also the bars and clubs aren't considered the only 'approved' public interaction places between strangers. Also I just simply don't see people or specifically women in my home country walking around clenching their phones, preemptively pretending to be getting calls, and having iPods in their ears at all times when outside even when there's no music playing.

Anyway, I guess this is American society now... at least there's money here.

"Ladies, is this explanation of why cat calling sucks accurate?","A little background: This excerpt is from a transcript of a podcast run by Tucker Max and Dr. Geoffrey Miller (an evolutionary psychologist) that is geared toward dating advice for young men. In it, Tucker and Dr. Miller interview Dr. Carin Perilloux, another evolutionary psychologist, and the topic turns to what women worry about. Cat calling gets brought up.

&gt; Tucker:
&gt; 
&gt; You did a paper on what people worry about? We have this – we go over this again and again and again with guys. What are some things that women worry about that guys just don’t understand or don’t worry about?
&gt; 
&gt; Carin:
&gt; 
&gt; In that paper we didn’t really look at that per se, but anecdotally we can talk about things that…. One of David Buss’ studies was what are things that the opposite sex does that irritate or annoy you and there were like 140 things or something. The number one thing for women was sexual coercion and guys thought, when they were asked, they thought ‘women probably don’t like that’ but they didn’t think it was nearly as problematic as women did. So that’s something I think women worry about a lot. And maybe not explicitly or thinking about it and worrying about it all the time, but it’s something that’s in the back of every woman’s mind, and something that guys really don’t have to think about as much.
&gt; 
&gt; Geoff:
&gt; 
&gt; By sexual coercion we mean guys stalking, harassment, date rape, rape.
&gt; 
&gt; Tucker:
&gt; 
&gt; Clearly rape and date rape. They’re the same thing. You don’t have to call them separate things. All forms of rape. Clearly that, but I think a lot of guys don’t understand sexual coercion, how encompassing, what that means. Forms of harassment, cat calls, whatever. There are some women that don’t mind cat calls but here’s what a lot of guys don’t understand. Tell me if you agree with this, because you’re an attractive woman and you know the research. From your perspective, say you’re walking down the street or whatever, and some guy’s like ‘Hey baby, I want to get up in that ass’ or something. You can tell they’re just a douche yelling at you. You can sit here and say that’s not, that doesn’t bother me, but as I understand it most women, especially when that happens over and over and over, get really, really fucking annoyed with that. It makes sense to me. Does that happen to you or happen to a lot of women that get annoyed with it?
&gt; 
&gt; Carin:
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t know if annoyed is the right word. Maybe you say it’s annoying. But it does trigger something where it’s sort of fearful. Particularly if it’s a group of guys. That’s really scary because to them they think it’s, presumably, most of the time they’re doing it because it’s funny and they want to get a rise out of you or whatever, but to a woman, you don’t know that that’s the underlying motivation. So it’s like ‘Holy crap! What are my resources, where can I go right now?’ That triggers so many things in your head.
&gt; 
&gt; Tucker:
&gt; 
&gt; It triggers a fight or flight response.
&gt; 
&gt; Carin:
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly. And again for the error management reason. Yeah maybe they’re being funny and you should just forget about it and brush it off but on the other hand there’s a huge potential cost…. it’s like after it happens so many times and nothing bad happens but it’s still triggering this horrible response all the time, it turns into annoyance. But for me it’s more, it prompts me to be scared. And maybe I get annoyed that I have to be scared. I don’t want that.
&gt; 
&gt; Tucker:
&gt; 
&gt; Of course. We say this to guys over and over. I mean, how many times have we said this? Number one that women are thinking about when they’re around you, especially meeting you, if they don’t know you, is physical safety. And guys never think of it because guys aren’t worried. I mean “I’m not worried, physical safety, what are you talking about? I’m not going to punch anybody.” She doesn’t know that dude. She doesn’t know that. And until she knows you she can’t know that. And most guys never know that.

Could you kick your husband or BF's butt if you wanted to? How does that affect your relationship?,"Could you kick your husband or boyfriend's butt? Just a hypothetical, I'm sure there would be no reason why you'd want to of course, I'm just saying: ""Could"" you?
If you could, would that affect the relationship dynamic? Even if you say it's no big deal, wouldn't you want to have a man who could protect you instead of the other way around?

My wife could. Easily. I am tall, in fairly good shape and just never been in a fight in my life. When I was in school, I was tall for my age, never went looking for trouble and never 
got any. It helped that my older brother was on the football team too ;)
Adult life came, college, grad school, career… I still just have never been in a situation where I had to defend myself or others. 

My wife has been in a few actual fights in her time, with other girls and with guys. She's been involved with martial arts, fitness and can really handle herself. She looks harmless, 
until you see her move. 

So…we were out last weekend, walking in the city after a play. Two drunk guys were harassing people on the sidewalk. We ended up directly in their path and line of sight. 
They noticed us and were commenting to each other and laughing while looking our way. There was traffic so we couldn't cross the street to avoid them. 
We got lucky because someone they knew came out of a nearby bar, clearly pissed at them about something and they all got into a shouting match while we simply 
walked around them. Still, my first instinct was to tense up slightly while hers was to step slightly ahead of me and assume a subtle ""ready"" posture. She looked more 
annoyed at them than intimidated though. My adrenaline was still up half an hour later. We talked after. I told her that I'd have her back no matter what but realistically, if something 
happened, I'd have no idea what I was doing since it would be my first time. She laughed and said she would show me some moves sometime. She also WISELY told me that
because I have never been in a fight, that I see almost every potential confrontation as an unavoidable fight. She doubted that it would have gotten to that point but was 
ready if it had. She said that I need to get over my fear and invited me to start training. I asked her if it bothered her that she could kick her husband's ass… if she felt 
disappointed since traditionally men protect women. She said it never really entered her mind because she could handle herself. She was attracted to me for other qualities. 
Then she joked that I better watch myself, with a sly smile.

I realize it is 2014 and men and women can do all sorts of things, some better than others. I realize that gender roles are a relic but still, they are part of the world I grew up with 
and it's been a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience to confront them and accept a different dynamic. 

Could you kick your husband or boyfriend's butt? Would YOU be more capable if you were ever in a situation where you had to defend each other from harm? How does that
affect your relationship or doesn't it matter? I'm curious because my wife said there are probably more couples like this than I'd suspect.",AskWomen,2,1395871567.0,35,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/21gbew/could_you_kick_your_husband_or_bfs_butt_if_you/
How should guys respond to seeing women being sexually assaulted/harassed?,"Hey, this whole thing happened for me at a party a few nights ago, and it has been driving me absolutely crazy ever since. I don't know much anything about trigger warnings, but this might be a triggering thing, I know it really upset me. The context is that this guy had been flirting with a girl that I am friends with for the entire night, in a very aggressive and demeaning manner (Think 'The Game' turned up to eleven.), and at one point they hugged, and then he groped her breasts, something he acknowledged himself.

She reacted with shock, as did everyone around, but people (even those that were quickly after outraged) seemed to wave it on. Then after it had sunk in, we started talking to her and trying to comfort her, as she was very upset by the entire ordeal, and said she felt guilty and bad for feeling uncomfortable about his sexual harassment/assault. It was really really awful, and absolutely ruined the evening. When the guy came back and started talking to her again, my girlfriend, also a friend of hers told the guy to back off, and for the most part, he left her alone for the night, aside from repeatedly walking in/around whatever room she was in at the time/glancing at her. It felt like it wasn't my place to intervene, but I was absolutely furious that someone would hurt my friend like that, it's been driving me crazy.

I wanted to intervene, but I find myself at a loss for what action I could have/should have taken that would have not complicated things for my friend. I wanted to speak up for her, or tell the guy to leave, or even physically remove him if he groped her again, but I don't know if that would have helped or made things worse, let alone imply that she can't stick up for herself.

"How do I show an abused woman, I want to date, that she can trust me?","Hello, I'm pretty new to this forum and forums in general. I'll cut to the chase. I'm a 23 year old guy who likes this 25 year old woman. I like her a lot to be honest. 

I'll give a little background on her. She has 2 kids, she has been physically, verbally, and sexually abused in her life. Her real dad walked out on her, her step-dad was verbally and physically abusive. Her first relationship the guy was physically, verbally, and sexually abusive towards her. Her next relationship the guy wanted nothing to do with her while she had her kids around. She has tried suicide in the past.

I met her through while I was hanging out with some of her friends. She asked her friends all about me and I'll admit when I first saw her I was attracted to her. So we hung out that night, her and I did a lot of talking. At the end of the night I told her I had a really good time and asked if I could have her number. She gave me it and I told her I'd talk to her later.

So we start hanging out and talking to each other a lot, via phone or text messaging. Anytime I am around she is nothing but smiles, giggles, and always cuddles up to me. She said she told her mom about me and her mom wants to meet me. I asked her if that was a good thing and she said yes, because she never tells her mom about stuff like this. She said she really likes me a lot and that I'm so sweet and kind. She did remark one time though that I scared her because she's never met anyone like me. She also talks to her friends about if I'm being real or if this nice guy thing is just a front, she asks them a lot from what they've said. 

So things are going along really well and we are text messaging each other on Sunday just talking about things, and she is laughing and just flirting back and forth etc. Well she said she was going to bed and I told her goodnight sweet cheeks I'll talk to you tomorrow. I got up on Monday and sent her a text saying good morning, how are you doing. She didn't answer so I figured she is busy with work etc. She calls me then at 5:15, I couldn't talk because I was at work so I told her that via text messaging and asked if everything was alright? She said she needed me to call her because she had to talk to me. I called her and ask what's going on and she starts with, ""It's not you it's me, I have issues I need to workout right now and I'm so sorry, but you are such a great guy etc."" I was baffled.

I didn't know what to say. I text her on Tuesday telling her I'd been thinking about her all day, which is true, and if it'd be okay if I called. She said there was nothing to talk about and she didn't want to talk and that she was sorry. I responded with I just want to get to know you and I'm not an asshole and I'm not going to hurt you and I just want to get to know you more is all. She responded back with very incoherent sentences and said she wants to be left alone among other things.

I am a nice guy and I love being around this girl. She's so smart, funny, gorgeous, sassy, I just like her so much. I don't know what to do. I've thought about going up there, but I'm afraid that will scare her. I thought about writing her a hand-written letter, but I've been told I shouldn't do that. I was told not to get pushy with her and just leave her alone. I just want to show her that I care about her and that I'll be there and I'll never hurt her. I've been sick over this since Monday and I'm going crazy because I do not know what to do. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions as to what I can do? My gut tells me to do one thing, but everyone warns against it. I don't want to screw this help and any advice or help would be so appreciated.

TL;DR
I like this woman a lot, she has been physically, verbally, and sexually abused by every male figure in her life basically. She is scared and she doesn't trust me so she cut contact with me on Monday and told me to leave her alone. I want to be with this girl a lot and I don't know what I have to do to show her she can trust me. I know she likes me from what she has said. I'm looking for help.

Do you find the public treatment of breast cancer awareness disgusting or healthy?,"Of course there is no right or wrong answer to this. I'm just asking for other perspectives out there. Now for some context:

My best friend is doing a university art project in which she and a partner picked a topic that meant a lot to them, and then swapped to allow their partner to create their own work expressing their feelings on the topic. The topic her partner picked for her was breast cancer and breast cancer awareness. So she and I were chatting about it and our feelings on the subject, and we seem to feel completely the opposite. I'll paste a piece of our conversation here, but I wanted to check with others who might have breast cancer themselves or have a near and dear loved one who is going through it and ask their feelings on the matter. I know men are capable of getting breast cancer too, but since a male's chance of dying from it is statistically about 1/10th the chance of a female's, all of the public talk about it seems to focus on women, which is why I came to this subreddit for this.

&gt;Her: She gave me breast cancer, and one of those little pink ribbons. Breast cancer pisses me off. Its all pink ribbons, smiling, laughing women, pink buses, pink decorating runs, all this shit. It just feels so glorified. But it's awful. It's this horrible disease that kills people and destroys families. But I feel like that's a tender point, and maybe people close to it don't want to look at it that way. Maybe they like celebrating it? So I've been struggling to consolidate how I feel with what's socially acceptable. And last night I came across with forum of breast cancer survivors pouring their hearts out about their experience and how much they hate the glorification of it all, and how much they hate the pink ribbon. Just have me the confidence and reassurance to go down that path. So I started playing with it last night. Destroying the ribbon, mixing it with hair (hair loss being a huge part of chemo and part of the experience for Lorna's mum, but loose hair no longer attached to people is generally considered pretty gross).

&gt;Me: I just imagine if I was going through that. Or if god forbid it were to take you or my mom away from me, that whole celebration of it would keep me from feeling alone, regardless of knowing that I actually wasn't alone. And I know it's just my bias, but that's why I imagine the celebration is there. Working in retail back in October really got me into it. Donating, wanting to raise awareness...

&gt;Her: See to me it's just this horrific reminder. People smiling and dancing about an extremely traumatic event. Plus I'm finding the ""awareness"" thing really hard to buy.

&gt;Me: I don't think anyone who goes through it is able to forget about it no matter how hard they try, not healthily anyway. It being out of mind is kind of a luxury for those of us who don't have to deal with it in some way. I would think it's better to embrace it and turn it into a positive thing to get you through it and keep you from just breaking down and losing it at the fact that you or a loved one is very really likely to be gone. When there's really nothing you can do to prevent that. I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings. Just trying to look at the whole thing differently.

&gt;Her: Yeah, I realise my take on it isn't going to be a popular one, but I do feel that it's fair. I'll always remember the hard things I've gone through, but walking down the street seeing them be celebrated would be very difficult for me.

"Ladies who've been sexually harassed, how did you get over it?","I live in Seoul, South Korea and was just harassed about a couple hours ago (11 pm) in an enclosed alley where my apartment is.  I was on the phone with my boyfriend walking back to my apartment, turned into the alley and had the weirdest feeling that someone was following me.  I turned around and sure enough, someone was. Ten feet away from me.  He was waddling toward me with his pants around his ankles jerking off.  He then stops waddling and just stands there doing his thing.  There's no one else around.  I reached for my keys and positioned them between my fingers Wolverine-style in case he tried to attack me.  My apartment was still a 20-second walk from where I was.  I started to walk backwards (still facing him) for obvious reasons  and told him to stop following me.  He pulled his pants back up and continued to slowly walk towards me.  Realizing that I was still walking backward while keeping my eyes on him, he stopped, took off his pants AGAIN and went at it AGAIN with his dick.  At the time, I felt like I was left with the options of 1. Do I face forward, run to my apartment and risk being potentially attacked from behind or 2. Keep facing him and walk backward knowing he's probably getting off on it?  I chose option 2. 

In the end, he got off on my fear.  He won, I lost.  He now knows where I live and can/will probably target me again because I just 'took it' the first time. I know how to react next time: Curse, scream, maybe carry a fork in my purse from now on (a friend that I spoke to about this says she carries around a fork for protection) and scare him off instead of being scared and submissive.

**TL;DR: Walked down a secluded alley at night and was mentally and emotionally defeated by a guy who simultaneously waddled towards me and man-handled his mini tootsie roll.**

"Would you consider ""gawking"" sexual harrassment in the workplace?","I apologize in advance if this is not the correct venue for this question.

About a month ago, my workplace hired a guy who has had prior experience in the field. I was immediately put off by him because he's extraordinarily arrogant; the type that *must* be right. Always.

I'm 27 years old. I work 2-10:30 pm M-F at a local hotel. Prior to going into the hotel I work at a school as an elementary teacher. I don't carry my hotel uniform with me, rather, I leave it at work and change when I arrive for my shift for convenience (and wrinkle) purposes. Because I leave my uniform for the next day, I change back into my street/teaching clothes before I go home for the night. I really don't think it matters what I wear or my physical type for my experience to be any less ""serious"". 

Anyhoo...I have noticed him gawking at me as I leave for home at the end of the night and, as he's night auditor, I can't avoid seeing him unless I leave 30-45 minutes early from each shift (which, I can't do for monetary purposes as well as respect for my manager). Because this has happened a minimum of 10 times, I have asked him to stop, I have mentioned to my manager that I refuse to speak to him/be in the same room as him unless it is absolutely necessary and job related and, I stated *why* this is the case. 

I am so terribly uncomfortable around him and I know several other girls at work feel the same way, but they're not willing to risk causing problems to fix this. Ex: Another female co-worker had an experience where he called her fat to her face. She *did* talk to the manager and the ""issue was solved"" by having every employee watch a YouTube video on sexual harrassment. His behavior has not changed whatsoever.

I feel as though these two unresolved experiences alone are reason enough to report and/or file for sexual harrassment. Agree or disagree? Help.",AskWomen,8,1360022303.0,27,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/17wdar/would_you_consider_gawking_sexual_harrassment_in/
"Do you try to withhold making any expression, and avoid making eye contact when walking past strangers on the street?","I ask this because it seems that as I am about to walk past someone on the street (mainly noticed this with women), and take a quick glance. Women tend to look slightly uncomfortable like they are purposely trying to avoid eye contact (trying hard to stare straight ahead, or turning their head away at the last second) and hold back in making any expression (I can tell in because it looks forced and kind of awkward for them).
I am a 27 year old male and it makes me confused and feel like I have an unpleasant appearance (even though I don't look dangerous).

How do I reduce my junkie-like excessive need for male approval?,"I have a serious problem when I am around men - if i'm in the street or a store... anywhere... which is that I look to see if they think I am attractive and if they don't then I feel like i've been punched in the stomach - completely worthless. I have to start off by saying that I am considered ugly by men who have told me this in the street, in person etc. I am however, presentable - it is my face. The last time I was insulted very aggressively, I stopped wearing eyeliner and just felt there was no point in even bothering anymore. I feel better not putting on make up and getting abuse than making a lot of effort and getting abuse. In the past few years i'd say the comments have died down to the point where I only hear some men say things about me every so often to their friends ('that's your girlfriend' followed by laughter etc.) but it hurts and I still feel I need their acceptance. It feels like a form of OCD to me where I am constantly ""checking"" in with them to see what my worth is. I would like to be able to pass men in the street and not notice/care about who they are looking at. Has anyone ever been like this and successfully 'undone' this habit? How?

Background: father present but neglectful/rude/boorish. I have had boyfriends but they were also neglectful people who i placed at the centre of the relationship. I know enough to choose well in future if I choose to be in a relationship again but it's not my priority. I just want to walk in the street and not feel anxiety. At this present time I just make myself avoid looking at them. 

I would also like to be even more presentable and look more stylish however how can I accomplish this without making it about men? If I wear make up and men look then I will feel ""high"" like i'm on a drug and my appearance will be about them then when they don't look, I will come crashing down. 

Also if a woman looks away from me, I don't feel bad (even if she called me ugly, i wouldn't care) however I have never been insulted in the street by a woman and women treat me like a human being. With men it is as if I either don't exist or I am a nuisance who is in their way.

I am in my 30s so I should have dealt with this but I haven't. It's like a drug.",AskWomen,27,1428577407.0,20,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/31zhma/how_do_i_reduce_my_junkielike_excessive_need_for/
I have not been in a relationship since high school. I am a man in his thirties. What should I do?,"A little background on myself for relevance.

I have not been in a relationship since I was in high school and am now in my thirties. It was the only relationship I have been in and was a virgin before that. I was a very quiet antisocial straight A kid with family problems and was bullied at school. The relationship was your typical high school kind of thing and ended when she cheated on me. Basically just kids being kids. After that I was a bit jaded and didn't have anything to do with women for a few years. I had enough to deal with in terms of things like sick parents followed by drug addiction, dropping out of school, and a whole lot of other things I'd rather not talk about. My childhood was not pleasant and I'll leave it at that. 

For years after that the majority of interaction I had with women had been one night stands, not because I was pursuing them but because they would pursue me. I became an alcoholic with very low self esteem. That coupled with my drug addiction and all the other things I was still dealing with at that time and it was a very dark point in my life. I began to objectify women like they were doing to me, probably just thinking that was normal and began to pursue them only for sex. After a while there were a few girls I began to see regularly but nothing I would consider to be a relationship and I never really had an emotional connection with them. They were as troubled as I was and a lot of drugs and alcohol were involved. Things progressively got worse and suicide was a daily thought.

Eventually some things happened that made me begin to really try and get my life together and cut myself off from everyone I had known. After a very long time and a lot of hard work fast forward to the present. I have long since conquered my addictions and overcame all the shit life had piled on top of me. I'm confident, happy, and healthy. I'm not horribly wealthy but live a good life that I find fulfilling. Attractive intelligent women frequently show genuine interest  in me and I have no problems approaching them. My problem Is that I really don't know what to do at this point. I've had a few innocent flings with girls over the years but nothing serious. 

I've never taken a girl on a date or tried to pursue a relationship since I wasn't ready yet so things, as you could imagine are a bit awkward for me. If I start wanting a relationship with someone or begin to have feelings I tend to back off and lose my confidence because of this. And let's face it if I brought up the fact I haven't been in a relationship since high school that's pretty much going to kill things on the spot. I've overcome a lot and have learned to be happy by myself but I'm ready to move on with my life and find someone to share it with. I'm a fairly private person and have no one to really ask for advice because I've cut myself off from my past. I've pretty much had to reinvent myself from the ground up to escape it. My friends ironically just tend to think I'm very promiscuous because I never have a girlfriend and get more attention than them.

So the question/questions would be how should I, as a man in his thirties go about pursuing a relationship with someone? I'm fine up until the point where I want something more than just friendship or something casual. What should I be doing? Nothing really comes very naturally to me because I've missed out on so many experiences. It's not like I can be dating people close to my age trying to figure these things out like we were kids. What would be normal? How much should I avoid talking about my past? Pretty much any advice that may help me move forward. I'm sorry if this seams a bit silly but it's the last big hurdle I have left for me to feel like I've finally moved beyond my past.

Need to make sure I'm not totally off base here.,"Tonight, I spent the evening with a delightful young lady, and we had a wonderful time.  Unfortunately, our evening ended less cordially than it had went earlier.

I'm waiting for the bus with her that will take her to the place to catch the shuttle back to her school.  The bus comes to the stop, but she's standing at the wrong door.  Before she can get to the right door, the driver shuts the door and drives away.  This was the last bus of the night.  Needless to say, I'm outraged.

She pulls out her iPhone and calculates that she's 2.5 miles from where she needs to get to.  She figures that she'll just walk.  

Public transit is basically closed (this notorious college city has the bright idea to close everything right around midnight).  It's after 1 AM.  She wants to walk alone for two and a half miles at 1 AM in an (admittedly well-lit, but bar-dotted) area she is not familiar with.  She figures that she knows how to take care of herself, and that nothing's going to happen, and that I shouldn't act this way just because she's female (freshmen, huh?).

It goes without saying that I am extremely reluctant to let this happen. A good man does not let a woman walk that far in the dark and the cold on a Friday night after 1 AM.  It takes some real cajoling (by the end of which she was somewhat pissed with me), but I convince her to take a cab to her shuttle stop.

This is a special girl.  This was our first time spending together, but I think we both see real potential for something here.  I feel bad for being a bit of an ass about this.  But I would feel far worse waiting for her to tell me she got to her stop safely for over an hour, and I would have a hard time living with myself if something were to happen to her.  That, and the second thing her friends would have done if something had happened would have been to come for my man bits.

I also insisted that she let me pay for dinner next time to make up for how the evening ended.

I don't think I'm off base, but I haven't had the chance to ask any females yet.  I did good, right?  You ladies would have come for my man bits if I had let her walk all that way alone, wouldn't you?",AskWomen,0,1354345760.0,26,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/143fnv/need_to_make_sure_im_not_totally_off_base_here/
Why do women look down when they pass me on the street?,"If I'm walking alone on the street and I pass by a woman under ~30 walking alone, she tends to look down. Sometimes the eyes, sometimes the entire head.

I'd like to know why. Girls, do you ever notice yourself looking down when you pass a guy, and why? I'll provide some details to clarify what's going on.

When wearing sunglasses I've checked. They often look up at me right as they pass by, but not before. After they pass by, they lift their head (I've looked behind to check).

I'm 27, handsome, lean, and muscular. Fairly well dressed. When I got really lean last summer, I noticed a lot more girls turning their head down as opposed to just their eyes. 

I'm also short, 5'6"", basically eye level with a lot of the girls looking down. 

Basically I'm trying to figure out if these girls are shy and attracted to me, or if I look intimidating. Could be a bit of both.

Almost all girls walking alone do this to some extent. If a girl is walking with someone else, she doesn't. If I do make eye contact with a girl, she looks down again (as opposed to away or up, which usually indicated neutrality and disdain, respectively)

This may seem like a weird question, but it happens *every* time I go outside for a walk and I'd love to figure out what's going on. 

**Edit:** Thanks for the answers. I should clarify that it's not just about them not making eye contact. It's that they look down, including with their whole head.

When I was less muscular girls would look straight ahead, or away, or up. They never do that now. They'll look straight ahead sometimes, but mostly down.",AskWomen,2,1365349779.0,25,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1buudq/why_do_women_look_down_when_they_pass_me_on_the/
I don't want to be scary! How do I not scare female people I end up walking behind at night?,"Scene: this evening, San Francisco, near CVS.
Enter me. 6'4"" lumberjack looking bearded fellow.  Internally, a perfectly kind individual (hopefully). Externally, a speedy walker and hulking presence.

Twice tonight, once on the way to CVS and once on the way back, it was clear to me that I made the female person walking ahead of me uncomfortable.  Like looking over their shoulder, talking on their cell phone, speeding up their walk type stuff.  

This happens all the time to me. I don't want to be scary.  Current strategies I have:

Slow down my speed, stop completely and wait, or walk around the block to go in a different direction.  Look at the sky, etc. But sometimes I'm in a rush and can't do this.

Cross the street and walk on that side.  Feels really awkward.

Speed up and pash them, so slight increased stress for them, followed by relief.

I hate that people respond to me this way! What can I do to make my presence less intimidating?

I need help to find if she likes me or if I have a good chance with her.,"Hello, I have been in this subreddit for about 2-3 days and i have seen really good stuff that help me. but I need your help (if you can) to see if i have a good chance with her, so lets start:
ok for some background info, I have met her for about 4 months now, she is a freshman in High School and I am a Sophomore. We have 1 class together and that is Geometry.

I want to have a ""more than friends relationship"" with her, but i need help because i have never had a gf before. But anyways, her and I are really comfortable with each other , we have really good conversations when texting (i always or most of the time start the conv.) I think i have good chance with her because she really enjoys (I feel) whenever I talk to her or text her, she always laugh at almost everything I say or do, and well we just have a god time.

Now one thing too, is that we only see each other/talk during school about 2 times 3 if lucky, she is the one that starts the conversation always (at school). Now, i feel that I can talk to her way more during school because i see her walking down the hall alone for most of the time, to go to her other classes, but its just i guess im really shy and have Approach Anxiety and I also over-analyse stuff like: what if she is having a bad day or if she just doesnt want to talk right now? 

But anyways, I text her every 2 days and when i do we are like texting back and forth for about 3-4.5 hours. It seems like she likes my personality and is comfortable with it (im really funny, random,good-looking,and can socialize well) 

for example about 3 days ago i texted her this:
*Me: Guess what?!!?!!!*
*Her:Whhhaatttt?*
*Me:I've been meditating.. And.... Out of all the (lets call her)Mikayla's in the world.... I think your my favorite!!*
*Her:Omg!!!!! I am so honored!!!! Lol*
*Me:Cool!! It's good to feel honored from time to time ... Good for ur health*
*Her:Lmbo!!! Okay dr Sw0rdsman!*
*Me:Yup you know it!! Ur favorite Dr. Right hurr!!!*
*Her:Yeshhhhhhhh!!!*

And the next her I texted her this:
*Me:Just a small town girl ...*
*Her:Living in a lonely world!!*
*Me:Hahah!!! Lol I really thought u were gonna go like huh ? Lol nice follow up!*
*Her:Tanx!!!*

So that is just part of it, at the end of the day we ended up with a good note and saying good night to each other. That is what normally goes on with the conversations sometimes i put a lil more flirting into it and she responds really well.

Can you (if you can, from a woman's point of view) give me some tips maybe that I can make her feel a lil more attracted to me, because sometimes she doesnt seem but then the next day she seems more interested in me. Also do u think maybe im stepping into the ""freindzone"" because that is my biggest fears right now with her, and if i am almost there what can i do to try to get back in to the ""he seems attractive"" type of deal?

Do you ever feel chivalry or indignation when a woman mistreats a man in public?,"Last week's ""What's the worst date you've ever gone on thread"" had the story of a woman who went on a movie date with a guy that kept trying to push physical boundaries too quickly. She walked out to the lobby and he followed her and tried to hold her back. The woman then made a scene when he wouldn't listen and she stated something in the thread to the effect of, ""[Her reaction] got a few tough-looking guys in the theater lobby to look at them, and their facial expressions said 'If this guy gives you anymore trouble we'll take care of him for you.'""

This made me wonder if women respond in similar ways if the situation is reversed. Obviously social norms dictate men shouldn't physically harm women unless their lives, family or health are in danger (and the last one is questionable). If he does without these conditions, nearby guys will come up go to town on him. But if a guy is getting harassed in public by some woman who won't leave him alone, do nearby females have a ""Is this girl giving you trouble? I'll handle her for you"" instinct for random guys?

"Askwomen: I read this story, it gave me some views that i didn't know but i acknowledge now (as a male). I would just like to know what you all think about this story?","When I got home that night as my wife served dinner, I held her hand and said, I've got something to tell you. She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes.

Suddenly I didn't know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly.

She didn't seem to be annoyed by my words, instead she asked me softly, why?

I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn't talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to Jane. I didn't love her anymore. I just pitied her!

With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake of my company.

She glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved Jane so dearly. Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now.

The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn't have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with Jane.

When I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again.

In the morning she presented her divorce conditions: she didn't want anything from me, but needed a month's notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month we both struggle to live as normal a life as possible. Her reasons were simple: our son had his exams in a month's time and she didn't want to disrupt him with our broken marriage.

This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into our bridal room on our wedding day.

She requested that every day for the month's duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request.

I told Jane about my wife's divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully.

My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don't tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office.

On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn't looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young any more. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her.

On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me.

On the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn't tell Jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger.

She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. I suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily.

Suddenly it hit me... she had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head.

Our son came in at the moment and said, Dad, it's time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly; it was just like our wedding day.

But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn't noticed that our life lacked intimacy.

I drove to office.... jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind...I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, Sorry, Jane, I do not want the divorce anymore.

She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, Jane, I said, I won't divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn't value the details of our lives, not because we didn't love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death do us apart.

Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away.

At the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The salesgirl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, I'll carry you out every morning until death do us apart.

That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I run up stairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting CANCER for months and I was so busy with Jane to even notice. She knew that she would die soon and she wanted to save me from the whatever negative reaction from our son, in case we push thru with the divorce — at least, in the eyes of our son — I'm a loving husband...

The small details of your lives are what really matter in a relationship. It is not the mansion, the car, property, the money in the bank. These create an environment conducive for happiness but cannot give happiness in themselves. So find time to be your spouse's friend and do those little things for each other that build intimacy. Do have a real happy marriage!

Can some ladies shed some light on what the hell happened to me the other night?,"22 year old male virgin here. I am not completely clueless about women, just inexperienced. I think I've made a lot of progress over the past 2 or 3 years but I am still no lady killer. Anyways heres the story:

Im travelling through Europe right now, backpacking by myself, staying in hostels and what not. I am generally pretty shy, but a few nights ago I met up with an old friend in Poland and one thing led to another. I ended up meeting some of his friends friends friends, next thing I know I am on a college campus at a party. I meet this girl, Ill call her ""M"". I get a lot more social when I drink, and thats exactly what happened. We are hitting it off quite well. Somebody suggest we go to the club, Im all for that. Im pretty buzzed and feeling pretty confident. I get restless and grab her hand and playfully pull her away suggesting its time to go. She laughs, agrees, and were on our way. The rest of the group slowly starts following, but were ahead of them by a minute or so. She puts here arm around my waist, so im like ""fuck it"" and put my arm around her shoulder. Were walking down this path, side by side, flirting and whatnot, its kind of dark with not to many people around. She suggest we stop and wait for the others. I pull her into a little clearing off to the side that is dark. We start making out. Everything is going great. The rest of the group catches up and we continue on our way. The walk is about 30 min, the whole time were holding hands and kissing a lot. I will say that she was a little drunk, but still totally coherent. She stopped drinking after we left though so she would only have gotten more sober as the night went on. I ask her what she is doing tomorrow, it doesn't sound like much so I ask her if she wants to hang out. She did seem a little reluctant, but eventually she agrees and and gives me her number. We get to the club and for the rest of the night we have a great time. We kissed *alot*, danced quite a bit, got to know each other more, laughed together, and there was a lot of intense eye contact. I had every reason to believe this girl actually liked me. On the dance floor I was grabbing her ass quite a bit, and even rubbed her between the legs a little. If that doesn't tell me she is into me, I dont know what does. Eventually the place closes down and we have to leave. We walk outside together and make out some more. We talked some more about meeting the next day a little more before she leaves. I go back to the hostel and can hardly sleep I am so excited. 
When I wake up I just lie there waiting for her to text me. Finally she does, and this is what it says: ""Hey, I cant meet you today, its complicated. You should go to Warsaw"". ( I had told her I was going to Warsaw that day before we made plans). I just layed there in shock and disappointment for 20 min. I cannot figure out what happened, we left on a really good note and she seemed to really like me.
So can I get some insight into what happened, how I screwed this up? 

The best I can think of is that she realized that since I was a tourist, I wouldn't have been around for more than a few days. She wasn't looking for a one night stand because she isn't that kind of girl, and obviously a long term relationship would be impossible. Maybe she figured that meeting up with me wouldn't really go anywhere good.

Have you ever been to a bar alone? What was it like?,"I'm asking this in /r/askwomen because, while I feel this is something that might be considered slightly weird for either gender, it might be considered less socially acceptable for women. My social life is in kind of a weird place right now, but I'm trying to get out of the house more, even if it means going alone. So far I've kept it to things like shopping, taking walks, coffee shops, cafes, etc. but I figure...why not a bar? There are a couple more laid-back bars in my neighborhood (I'd never go to a loud clubby place alone...lol), and I'm trying to gauge how weird it would be to just go have a drink and maybe read a book or something or chat casually with people.

So if you've done this, what was it like? Was it a happy hour thing or at night? Did you get hit on? If you were in an awkward situation, how did you get out of it? Were you afraid that someone might follow you home because you were alone? Have you ever made friends this way? Do you think people consider it less socially acceptable for women?",AskWomen,14,1354232370.0,15,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/140su3/have_you_ever_been_to_a_bar_alone_what_was_it_like/
How do we(M) show/tell you that we don't want to rape you when walking along the street at night?,"I(M) always encounter this at night where I would be walking down the street, heading home. Along the way I would notice that there is a woman quite far ahead of me. As I get closer to her (because I'm a quick walker) she would look at me all funny and then cross the road, and glance at me occasionally (or stare, I know you do it I can feel it sometimes) to check that I'm not doing anything weird. It makes everything awkward. Making me feel uncomfortable because she's uncomfortable. 

And I can't just say ""Don't worry, I'm not going to rape you"" because that makes it very suspicious. Even asking this question on Reddit makes it suspicious.

It really is a grey area, I think. What do we do to make it seem a lot less uncomfortable?

Girlfriend of 6 months is still 'good' friends with her ex-boyfriend of 3 years. Female perspective is much appreciated...,"My girlfriend and her ex of 3 years (lived together for 2 of those) broke up earlier this year. She(23) and I(28) started dating 6 months ago and are currently 2 hours apart, so when there is time and no other engagements, we usually see each other every weekend. The distance is temporary based on my action in the next 2 months; we'd both be in school until summer, and near each other. Anyways she came into the city this weekend for basically the first time since she moved. We spent the night together last night, and then she had family and other errands to run today (Saturday). I know she still talks to her ex occasionally, and on Friday when she came into town she told me she had plans to meet her ex/his mom (3 years...) the next day. 

I told her I didn't feel good about that but we're both pretty reasonable, so she understood that it sucks for me, but doesn't feel it's necessary (indeed, she made the stand that she *won't*) cut off the friendship for a relationship. She totally understands where I'm coming from and admits it is a hard situation. I told her sorry if that is the ape-part of me, but it's just how I feel, emotions-wise. She has said the friendship is completely platonic (several references/statements over the past few months). Apparently, it ended mutually and they weren't in love with each other any more, they weren't having fun anymore. Etc. When I inquired a while back whether there was a potential that she'd want to get back together she said, ""No. We broke up for very specific reasons and I would not go back to that"".

So. I suck it up and decide to worry about it later. Well, last night *was* later and I found myself getting increasingly bothered by it over the day. She was only going to over and see him and his mother (I assume her ex lives with his Mom, only sort of relevant) with her dog, etc. Basically a catch-up session I reckon, didn't get total details. I sent her a premature text asking ""uh..how was it"" and she told me she was heading there and text afterwards. In the meantime, I found my mind wondering what they were doing, how she was with another man, and an ex no-less, on a Saturday night instead of me (even though we hung out the night before/that morning), etc. These thoughts come in and my emotions and my logical/reasonableness start conflicting emotions that are really hard to deal with.

Okay. 2.5ish hours later I get a text.

""Did you end up getting back to sleep""

""Yes. What are you doing."" 

""Lucky. Super tired, heading home (we didn't sleep much the night prior, long day, no sex jokes please). You?""

""Honestly trying not to be upset""

Then I called her. I we talked for about an hour about it -- she understands my position, has totally been there in the past, and was very understanding in the phonecall. My emotions about it and her understanding but not *being in my position* (and, indeed, me nor in hers) went in circles throughout the conversation. Basic premise:

M: **I don't want to the the kind of boyfriend who tells you you can't hang out with friends. But it really bothers me because you have a sexual and romantic past (I haven't actually said those last sexual/romantic comments yet, even though that's the real issue here.) with your ex and when you spend time together it make me feel really shitty inside.**

F: **I Understand that and totally get it, but i'm not going to sacrifice a friendship for a relationship. I want us to work through it but it's a hard situation for both of us, because I don't want to hurt you unintentionally.**

*(Sidenote: Apparently she doesn't feel sexual jealousy when it comes to me. She does have some bisexuality in her past, so I just thought that might be a reason. But she has felt it in the past, so maybe not. Anyways she doesn't know if it's a change in her ""philosophy"" of dating or if it's just with me because she's so comfortable/secure [what she has said]. So there's that in the basket as well.- She ""understands"" but claims to not relate any more.)*

While I was in the process of trying to come to terms with this idea, as it may be a semi-yearly (hopefully not more) occurrence, she told me (admittedly maybe not the best time but in the sake of full disclosure) her ex also plans on visiting her in the small (beautiful) town a couple hours away where she goes to school, a town which I have been trying to move to for some schooling as well. 

""To stay the night?""

"" Yes --- Well I would probably stay at my dads..."" (block away)

I obviously have a problem with her ex boyfriend coming to visit her alone (I guess I could open up the possibility of meeting him -- up until now I don't want to, I don't want his image in my head of their past together) and presumably stay overnight while they apparently walk around together and do stuff for a day or two. This just doesn't feel good to me, and I'm going to make a note her to ask why he is coming up to visit -- he lives in this state, and he can go to this town any time. Surely he has been there before...i digress.


*I just don't know how to feel.* She was very understanding on the phone and did not make me feel like shit (intentionally) for wanting to talk it out. She has offered to talk with me about it if it helps, or also offered not to talk about it if I'd rather sort it out myself.  Honestly, she's the most reasonable (in discussions -- I refuse to fight/argue loudly) and beautiful woman I have ever met, we get along so well, I'm absolutely in love with her , which is why I am: 

A. Having such a problem with her consistently (although likely every few months) seeing an ex-boyfriend on a friendship basis and

B. Why I am trying to hard to make personal concessions to make the relationship work, and be reasonable about my emotions about it.

*I should make it a point to say that we are very much attracted to each other, she cares about me a lot, knows I am in love with her, she is falling in love with me but not quite ""in love"" yet because of some of the issues of the year, probably the fact that she is still dealing with the loss of that relationship a bit, on top of getting into a new one relatively soon (3-4 months), though they had kind of been just friends for a while near the end. She was the first one to say ""I think i'm falling in love with you"". That was 3-4 months ago. No real update other than ""still falling.""*

*I should also make a note that I have never caught her in a lie, she is very (sometimes brutally) honest about everything, and there is no reason for me to doubt what she has told me about this ex-gentleman is true. She has done nothing intentionally to make me doubt my trust in her. While I have my own baggage from the past about girlfriends/exes, I am trying to come to terms with the idea that what she says **is actually fact**, it's just so hard to determine when emotions/relationships are involved.*

So be my frame of reference, /r/AskWomen: Do I have a right to disagree with these actions, or am I wrong, or what's the gray area? It is a very complex question and I need to try to sort my emotions on the matter. I want to be a good, understanding boyfriend, but I don't know if my emotions have a case here. Do they, given what you know about the situation? Or do I need to be okay with this? I have no exes who I am ""good friends"" with (the long-term ones and I don't talk, too many feels), so I don't have a frame of reference to what I would do in her shoes, or if this is something that I should be more okay with.

**TL;DR - My current girlfriend is still good (platonic) friends with her ex-boyfriend of 3 years. They still talk sometimes, hung out earlier this evening, and he's planning on visiting her in the town she just moved to, the both of them alone. Didn't ask when. This bothers me A LOT inside because of the implications of the matter, but am trying to be reasonable about it and a good boyfriend. She has been honest and forthright about the situation, has proven trustworthy and I would like to completely, 100% trust her and hope it is as she says. But it's very hard to do.**

**Post-Script:** I wrote this out last night after we talked on the phone. Today, she came over before heading back and we talked a bit about it, only to reach a headway. Everytime I suggested the possibility/worry of there still being feelings between them, she met it with resistance -- she hasn't said anything like that, and is honest enough that I truly believe she would tell me if that was going to be an issue. She also said that nothing has changed since she saw him yesterday -- nor was she expecting it to. It seems just a friendship that used to be a relationship. After, uh, the following intimacy, wrapped up in the throes of post-coitus, I told her I would try to work through it and be okay with it. Maybe trusting her makes me a sucker, but as I have said she has given me no reason to not trust her, and I think most of my insecurities come from past baggage (we all have it) and how ""these types of dramas"" play out in the movies and TV -- very poorly. I feel like I would rather be a sucker than an untrusting boyfriend. ",AskWomen,2,1350862631.0,15,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/11v8i4/girlfriend_of_6_months_is_still_good_friends_with/
"22 y/o male, haven't even had my first kiss yet. Help? ","i posted this a while back on /r/seduction (i know some you of you dislike those guys) and got some half decent advice. Now i'm just asking for the female perspective. 

K, I'm a 22 year old who's quite good looking (I think). I'm 186cm (6'1""), slim, palish skin, dark hair. i'm a loner and rarely had any friends. I mean i talk to my fellow classmates and co-workers at school and stuff but i've never had any real friends. I have zero social skills, i'm akward, shy, quiet, and a social outcast. I also can't speak in front of public, get nervous when i'm on the bus or in social situations, people have accused me of staring at them without me noticing. Needless to say i've never had a female friend, let alone a girlfriend so I haven't even had my first kiss yet.

During high school years i felt like i was too weird to hang out with the normal kids and too normal to hang out with the weird kids. I'm currently doing an honors engineering degree (4th year, top university, not a party school). So, girls are non-existant in my program (well, we have 2-out of 100ppl- not so feminine girls in the program so that's that). I spend all of my time either at school or in front of my computer playing video games. However, i dress sharply/fashionably and sometimes i've gone overboard which has resulted in some people thinking i'm gay. Also, i can't keep a conversation going for more than 2 mins, afterwards the subject automatically changes to video games and homework or alternatively, always end up in awkward silences.

I've gone to parties and girls have approached me to give me their numbers (i've never had the courage to actually approach a girl) or hit on me but it always goes the same way; me blushing and nervously saying ""thanks"" followed by an awkward silence and the girl(s) leaving me prolly thinking 'what a freak'. :( I also have random girls hitting on me on the street and stuff every now and then but i always freeze and don't know what to do or say so it all goes to shit fast.

Also, i'm kinda insecure about my body because i'm fuckin hairy and since my hair is dark and my skin is kinda pale it stands out way more than it should. What should i do about my body hair? Should i trim or get rid of them (wax/laser)? 

Let's see, what else... i have OCD and ADHD, i think (not clinically diagnosed). On the other hand, my sister who's a year younger than me is pretty much a facebook celebrity, has a ton of friends, has had shit load of boyfriends and is always out with her friends. I'm fuckin frustrated and depressed, not suicidal or anything though (yet). I closed my facebook account last year too (because no friends). What should i do?

I know you're all gonna be like 'oh dude, it's so easy, you just need to be social and talk to girls' it's not that simple and i'm often way outside of my comfort zone.

tl:dr; 22 y/o handsome loser nerd guy with no friends who is socially awkward and has zero social skills.

- I actually tried r/seduction's advice. i went clubbing solo, and after finding a cute girl, i approached her and said 'hi' and she smiled back and said 'hi' and then i choked so hard, i couldn't say anything. This took her by surprise and made her back off. I left the club soon after.

How did teenage you learn about personal safety?,"I've got an almost 18 year old daughter, and while she's a lovely girl- bright, friendly, compassionate, involved, etc., she seems to have almost zero sense of self-preservation. 

We've got a good relationship, all of her parents/stepparents have always been pretty open about our own experiences etc- the results of some of the stupid things we did in the past, that most of us were lucky in that a lot of our bad decisions didn't have too many real consequences, but some of them did, etc. 

She just seems to have that teenage 'nothing will really ever harm me' attitude, and I'm finding it increasingly concerning.  Not making plans in advance as to how she's going to get home late at night, not necessarily making the best choices in friends, taking unnecessary risks (walking alone across dark fields at night rather than spending an extra 5 minutes taking a lighted sidewalk), being very influenced by other people, and wanting to be popular, letting her phone battery run down, etc.  Fortunately she's very up on birth control, sexting etc., so at least we don't have to worry much about that. 

We do live in a fairly safe area- chances are nothing will happen to her walking across a field at night, and fortunately her interest in substances is restricted to pot (there's not much of a legal downside to that where we live).  And while it's always still tempting to think 'she's a kid, we'll just ground her every time she makes a stupid decision', she's almost 18, and we need to give her the opportunity to make good decisions on her own. 

I've been thinking about encouraging her to sign up for a self-defense for women class- not just for the actual self-defense, but because it might give her a better idea of how to pay attention to her surroundings, not put herself in bad situations, etc.  But aside from that, I'm pretty clueless right now. 

Was there anything that your parents/friends etc did that helped you learn to be conscious of safety when you were a teenager?  I think that I pretty much learned from experience, and I know that it's the best teacher, but some of those instances were lessons that I'd really rather she didn't have to go through. 

Any ideas or stories are appreciated.  I know that we can't protect her from everything (and we don't want to), and maybe I should just be trusting to luck.  I'd just like her to be a bit safer in her decisions. 

tl,dr:  Worried about my teenage daughter's decision making processes.  Maybe I'm just paranoid?

"Women of Reddit, I came across something that left me a little curious as to how you all feel about guys who don't really get out all that much???","Some of the women I've been with are a lot like me, while others like to get out and burn a bit more tire tread.... I should say **I'm a hardcore gamer**, a bit of an anime fan, and I like to get out there and shoot, ride and drive when I can. So most of the stuff I enjoy revolves around whoever has the most space. I've rented some power sports and go-carts here and there, but for the most part. Other than Airsoft, Paintball, RCs, Laser Tag, Riding or Walking Trails, Malls and Theaters. I usually just get out for a little food or consumerism, I'm love driving just for fun and enjoying a little fast food and some shopping. However, I'm a bit more of a loner unless I'm spending time with someone I've gamed with. Or met through a club event or a mutual friend.... I can be easy company in my element and generally I'm not all that cocky or competitive even when I'm doing something I'm really good at. I'm the kind of guy that likes to see people enjoy spending time with me. So if I see a chance to affect someone else's consumerism or there time alone. I generally try to get them to give a XBOX 360 or a Taurus Tracker 991 a chance at making there day.... I have a weakness for women that game and loungers in particular, so as far as getting out goes. Do you all enjoy just spending time with a guy out on the town, gaming online or just dropping by with a pizza, a movie and a smile.... I'm generally the type of guy that's more comfortable as a host rather than a house guest, but I also like to get out and drive with someone before they see my place. I can go out on the town or online with good eye contact and a good smile like it's nothing, usually I like to see someone's car first. Since I have a small place and have never really made it past the one bedroom apartments with my spending. I'd like to build a Z-Glass on a nice plot and forget about apartments as a whole, but I'm not quite there yet.... Anyways, I've always liked the rural settings much more than the urban ones. Though I enjoy a good meal and a little consumerism as much as anyone. So for a guy who likes to spend a lot of time gaming, who needs a bigger place and definitely likes to keep track of his time. How do you all feel about getting out??? If I have five hours of time with someone, I'll generally concentrate on meals, multiples, gaming, Hulu-NetFlix, Lounging, Driving, Riding, Trails, Shopping, Range Time, or just seeing what they're doing with their time when I'm not around. Don't get me wrong, I love spending time with women when we respond to each other. However, I usually go through my day the same regardless of whether I'm alone or with someone. **I guess in my mind we're all going through the day regardless, it's just a matter of how we divide our time and if we share it....** I'm currently single, but have always tried to include my SO in the best of my day and concentrate on making sure we enjoy our time together as much as possible.... So do most of you think that we should plan specific activities that we otherwise may not spend the time or money on, or that we should include you in our day as much as we can??? I do like keeping up with how we spend our time and money together. However, I like feeling I'm a part of something they've had in there life before I became a part of it and like we'll both take something away from our time together if we don't sync.... I've only had a few relationships in my life that have made the 3-6 month mark along with 2 that have lasted a few years. However, in almost every relationship I've had. We had a lot of fun together and we enjoyed our time, but eventually we were both looking for someone that we felt synced with our lives a bit more. Don't get me wrong, they were good women and good SOs. However, at the end of the day. We just didn't spend our time together and apart the same.... I even started doing an exercise in keeping up with our time together and apart I got from someone I had a lot of fun with who helped me start looking at how I wanted to spend my time. She got us to start looking at our time with each-other and alone in order to get a feel for how we incorporated into each-other's lives. We each kept a notepad by our beds and under our TV remotes. Then we'd use two letter initials to track time of anything we wanted to include our SO in. So meals were listed as ML and had the time we started followed by a dash and the time we finished. The same went for a few other initials, Gaming = GM, Hulu-Netflix = TV (Yeah I know that one seemed obvious....), Range Time = RA, Trail Time = TR, Drip Time = SX (Yes that includes our time with each-other and alone.), Sleep = SP (I've always been a night owl and this one just kind of shows up early if I sleep in and forgot to write when I woke up....). Then we'd rate the time itself on a scale from 1-10 to keep track of how we felt about our time, along with a smile if we were together and a little gold star if we happen to make a 10 in the course of our day A.K.A. ""SX 3:20 a.m. - 4:00 a.m (10)"" Anyways, we were always happy together. I love to wrap my arms around her, put my thumbs in her belt loops and pull her close. She liked playing with the hair on my arms and we were very aware of each-other if we were in the same room. We had good chemistry and she could make my dick drip without even trying to. Not to mention she could keep me up longer than most women I'd been with, she just made me grin because she was so casual about everything.... She could just slide her hand into her panties and work up a drip from the base of her velvet like it was nothing, she knew I was a Kasia fan and made a point out of it.... I never really knew when she wanted to go out, but she always enjoyed surprising me with a ""Have a little fun!!!"" attitude that would stiffen my dick. We both enjoyed gaming and movies, but she liked to give me little to no warning when she felt like doing something. Which made me grin at how impulsive she could be, but made it hard to read her. Anyways, we started looking at our time with each-other and alone and we started looking at how we divided our day up when we were with each-other and when we were alone.... Truth be told, we always tended to divide the time we had together between gaming, anime, sex, and meals. We never really did anything else while we were with each-other, of course that was almost as true of our time alone as well. That little moment in the day when you just want to lounge and curl up on the couch, your papason, recliner, or bed was the only real wild card in our time together. I had a relationship that lasted almost three and a half years and it is still the most satisfying relationship I've had with a woman to date!!! We were just always there for each-other, we weren't very structured and we didn't plan to far ahead. We just had crazy schedules and made the most of every day we could get a little overlap in our schedules. We spent a lot of time together just enjoying each-other, she kept up with me and I kept up with her and that felt like what we needed from each-other.... We still planned things where we could, but I've never had a job I got off before 10:00 p.m. other than a couple of freelances. I still want a call center job with someone like TSI to get my schedule a little more likable, I spent last year working 12 hour nights 4 days a week when I should have been taking credit card payments on 8 hour days.... Anyways, I've never really had a problem spending time with women. I like a good meal, some place they feel is theirs and that they're always welcome, a little curl up food and a little console time.... I guess it's obvious I typed all this at 5:07 in the morning huh??? Anyways, I just felt like tossing this one out there to see what pops up in the comments. **Truth be told, most of the women in my life know me well enough to know how I like to use my time.** So it's just a matter of how they get to know me and how I get to know them. I guess I wanted the opinion of a few women that don't know me at all. I know my type, and I'm happy with who I am. However, after reading a bit of Reddit a little earlier. I decided I didn't mind drawing this one out if I could get it all down in one post.... I know it's a little lengthy and it's way to late at night for me to be typing all this. However, as a single male I really just needed to toss this one out there somewhere and have it in my reddit profile as well. I don't know how many of you are familiar with them, but I decided to toss in a link to something that's helped me look at my time in the driver and passenger seat. I'm glad to say I've had the pleasure of adding a lot of gold stars to them over the years. So I don't mind the fact that they might seem like 30 seconds of the day you didn't have to spend. Once you have a month or two filled out in full, you'll enjoy keeping one under your driver's seat....

What do you think of Pamela Clark's article on ways for men to combat sexism?,"The author, a PhD student from the University of York, lays out on her blog [thirty-five ways in which men can help reduce our culture of sexism](http://pamelaclark.tumblr.com/post/87113711124/35-practical-tools-for-men-to-further-feminist).

Highlights include:

&gt;2. Do 50% (or more) of emotional support work in your intimate relationships and friendships. Recognize that women are disproportionately responsible for emotional labour and that being responsible for this takes away time and energy from things they find fulfilling. 

&gt;4. Give women space. Many women walk around—especially at night or while alone—feeling on edge and unsafe. Being in close physical proximity to an unknown man can exacerbate this feeling. Recognize that this is not an unreasonable fear for women to have, given how many of us have experienced harassment or abuse or been made to feel unsafe by men when we are in public spaces. Also recognize that it doesn’t matter if you are the kind of man who a woman has any actual reason to fear, because a woman on the street doesn’t have a way of knowing this about you or not. 

&gt;Examples: If a seat is available on public transit next to a man, take that seat rather than one next to a woman. If you are walking outside in the dark close to a woman walking alone, cross the street so that she doesn’t have to worry someone is following her. If a woman is standing alone on a subway platform, stand some distance away from her. 

&gt;5. … but insert yourself into spaces where you can use your maleness to interrupt sexism.***Examples: challenge men who make sexist comments and jokes. If you see a female friend in a bar/at a party/on the subway/wherever looking uncomfortable as a man is speaking to her, try to interject in a friendly way that offers her an opportunity for an “out” if she wants it. If you see a situation where a woman looks like she may be in distress while in the company of a man, stand nearby enough that you make yourself a physical presence, monitor the situation, and be in a position to call for help if needed.

&gt;6. When a woman tells you something is sexist, believe her.

&gt;7. Educate yourself about sexual consent and make sure there is clear, unambiguous communication of consent in all your sexual relationships.

&gt;8. Be responsible for contraception. If you are in a relationship where contraception is necessary, offer to use methods that do not have health risks for women (use of hormones, surgeries, etc.) and treat these as preferable options. If your partner prefers a particular method, let her be in charge of making that decision without questioning or complaining about it. Don’t whine about condom usage, and be responsible for buying them and having them available if that’s the method you’re using. 

&gt;Assume financial responsibility for any costs related to contraception. Women earn less than men, and also have to assume all the physical risk of pregnancy. Further, in instances where contraception involves any amount of physical risk, it is virtually always women who must assume this risk. As a gesture that redresses a minuscule amount of this disparity, heterosexual men should finance the whole cost of contraceptives. 

&gt;12. Pay attention to and challenge informal instances of gender role enforcement. For example, if you are at a family function or dinner party, pay attention to whether it is mostly/only women who are doing food preparation/cleaning/childcare while men are socializing and relaxing. If it is, change the dynamic and implore other men to do the same.

&gt;13. Be mindful of implicit and explicit gendered power differentials in your intimate/domestic relationships with women…whether a partner or family members or roommates. Work to recognize where inherent structural power differentials based on race, class, gender, sexual orientation, age (and so on). Where you benefit from these structural imbalances, educate yourself about your privilege and work on finding ways to create a more equitable balance of power. For example, if you are in a domestic partnership where you are the primary income earner, educate yourself about the gendered wage gap, and work on dividing labour and economic resources within your household in a way that increases the economic autonomy of your partner.

&gt;14. Make sure that honesty and respect guide your romantic and sexual relationships with women. The way you treat women with whom you are in a relationship is a mirror of your values about women in general. It doesn’t work to espouse feminist theory and then treat your partners like trash. Be upfront and open about your intentions, communicate openly so that women have the ability to make informed, autonomous decisions about what they want to do.

&gt;15. Don’t be an online bystander in the face of sexism. Challenge people who make, say, or post sexist things on the internet, especially on social media.

&gt;18. Don’t ogle or make comments about women. (i.e. Keep your tongue in your mouth and comments to yourself.) Even though women may be more prone to wearing more revealing outfits than men, don’t ogle them just because you want to and can. Though you may find someone attractive, there’s a line between noticing and being creepy/disrespectful. It makes the women being ogled feel uncomfortable, as well as any women who notice the ogling or are aware of the comments. 

&gt;22. Have integrity with your male friends. (i.e. Don’t be a “bro.”) When a male friend is doing something sexist (being a deadbeat dad, down-talking women, ogling women, secretly spending shared money, lying to their partner, etc) have integrity and say something to your friend. It’s not enough to think it’s wrong; let them know you think it’s wrong.

What do you think of the points there described? Do you agree with all of them? Do you think the list goes far enough?

"How frequently do you hang out with your male friends 1 on 1, and how frequently do you do ""date"" like activities with them?","PREFACE:  FUCK sorry in advance about the book, this has been gnawing at me obviously.  Also, I immediately hate that I said ""do you do 'date' like activities.  ""do you do"" what the fuck man... that sounds awful.  ""how frequently do you go on..."" would of sounded so much better.  Ok clearly I need to wrap this up.  Skip to the bottom if you're not in the mood for rambling.

I don't really feel like this is anything I should be self conscience about, but a friend recently brought some things to my attention, and I am curious how outside the normal my activities are.  

I've always had several close friends who are women, and while the majority of my friends are male, I've frequently had a few close, female friends who I always put a high value into their friendship.  Regularly in high school, I would stay over and watch movies or read books late, in very platonic settings.  In college I noticed a general trend towards privacy, if a girl wanted isolation with me she had romantic intentionswhile group settings were always platonic, so it was easier to gauge. But my life kind of fell apart around the age of 21, and I didn't really start picking it back up again till halfway through 24 and while I had romantic endevours, they were few and far between. And I guess that's the problem.  In the past couple of years, I've made some very positive and beneficial changes to my life, and now even the platonic situations are seeming more date-like to me as I've grown more and more successful with ""getting back on that horse.""

Lately, the tone seems to of changed among several women in my life.  Not only am I hanging out with them 1 on 1 more, the activities are definitely more ""date-y"".  It's everything from newly single neighborhood acquiescence reaching out to me for ""drinks after work"", to an old friend and I using the night her boyfriend was out of town (he knew everything by the way) to grab dinner, and go to a trendy hipster bar downtown.  There was the curator I went to school with, who I hadn't talked to in months who invited me over for wine, and 3 bottles later we were walking up to the neighborhood bar, then back to her place several drinks later.  There has been coffee, lunch, museums, art shows, gallery openings, and an obscene amount of cooking at my place and theirs.  The conversations are almost always intensely personal and honest, playful and flirty, sex almost always comes up, and on occasion the unavailable ones have played ""wingman"".  I'm not having trouble differentiating signals and things like that.  I know which girls may or may not be attracted to me, and while some of the situations definitely have some clear sexual tension, others clearly do not the general theme and activities all remain the same.  


But my friend addressed concern that they, and I were becoming reliant on these date like evenings.  That I'm proving a false companion of sort, and they are doing the same.  And I suppose he's not totally wrong.  I'm not one to turn down pretty, interesting women asking me to eat good food and drink booze with them, and I'm not going to feel guilty if I didn't get to sleep with them but now the flag has been raised, and I kind of got to know.  Is this just women interacting in their mid twenties?  Should I just shut up, and enjoy spending fun time with a parade of attractive, fun women, and stop over analyzing?  Every fiber of my being and instinct says ""just follow your gut, shut up and enjoy this"".  I mean it seems clear to me that the effort I put forth to improve myself is paying off, one way or the other... but I can't help but wonder, ""Should I look at these evenings more like dates, since the obvious dates can appear virtually the same as the platonic evenings out?

**TL;DR:  After working hard to improve several aspects of my life, I am now confronted with about a half dozen women from my life, acquiescence from the past, ex girlfriends, old long time friends, and long time crushes inviting me out for very date like activities, and while some are clearly not dates at all, I am for one worried that I *should* be reading into some of these, and two, am using these platonic ""dates"" as an emotional crutch instead of the real thing.""  At the same time, if interesting women keep wanting to do fun things with me and I'm not expected to pay, is that anything I should really be questioning anyways?  What are your intentions if you spend an evening alone with a guy, and how frequently does it happen?**

I guess I'm just kind of looking to hear how some other women spend 1 on 1 time with male friends in their life.  Thanks.",AskWomen,1,1363151903.0,11,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1a777i/how_frequently_do_you_hang_out_with_your_male/
How do you deal with public harassment?,"So last Tuesday, I was waiting for the light rail to go home at about 7:00pm. I had been at school (ASU downtown campus). All of a sudden, a man also waiting for the light rail tells me, ""damn ma'"" proceeding to look me up and down. He continued to say a lot of things such as you can be my new baby mama, you're so fucking fine, etc.

I was annoyed. I looked away, stood up tall, and refused to give him attention. When the light rail came, he followed me into the same cart I was in. He asked me to sit with him. I said no and chose to sit next to someone so he wouldn't have a seat near me. At this point, I was not listening to anything in my headphones (using it to avoid being talked to, but also needed to be aware). I could hear him speaking to another man in the light rail, talking about what he'd do to me. He kept calling out to me to turn around. Since I was choosing to ignore him, he sat the closest he could to me. He was trying to play footsies. I said no. Very loudly this time. He nudged the woman next to him saying, ""she doesn't want to play, but I'd play whatever game she wants all night."" The woman just rolled her eyes, looking at me with sympathy. I did not respond. He asked if I had a boyfriend. He threatened my ""boyfriend"" saying he would break him to take me from him. He kept asking me if I had somewhere to go, if I wanted to leave with him, etc. Then, he stood up and said, ""I'm nice unless you make yourself a stranger."" He touched my face and ran his fingers through my hair. I panicked at this point. I wanted to react, but I was frozen. By this time, the light rail was full of people. It made it harder to react since everyone was just looking at me with curiosity. They were waiting for me to react. I made eye contact with several people. They all just looked down in shame. He was still near me, saying things. But, I was frozen with fear, my ears ringing. The guy sitting next to me shook me out of it by saying, ""I'm getting off at this stop."" I decided to walk out with him even though my stop was only two stops over. I took my pepper spray out just in case he decided to follow me out.

I WAS MORITIFIED. I just got out and sobbed on the bench. I called my friend to pick me up. I don't know why, but this time the whole experience broke me in a new way. Usually, I'd defend myself, call for the light rail driver, call someone, etc. I think what made it so different was the fact that there was an audience watching, waiting for something. So ladies and gentlemen, how do you deal with harassment when it is so public and open?

tl;dr: I have dealt with harassment as a regular transit rider. But this time it was different. I was not the same person who would be proactive. I was weak. I was embarrassed by all the people on the light rail looking at me. How do you deal with harassment when there is a public audience?

"At work things, can anyone give some advice as to when to extend an invitation vs when to leave people alone?","I work in tech and I love learning so I spend a lot of time at conferences and events. The tragedy of how much it sucks to be a woman in that field is pretty well documented, and it really matters a lot to me, so advice from any woman in any field or even similar social situations would be really, really appreciated.

TL;DR: You're at a work thing where you don't know anybody and there aren't many other women. Do you just want to be left alone or do you wish one of the guys would reach out, even if you've had to deal with a lot of guys at this point?

LONG VERSION: Basically, I just want to know how to better avoid these two situations (or be told I am completely imagining things and given a new frame for what's happening):

1. At a lunch table with several other men, I notice the neighboring table is completely empty, except two women who are looking over at us. Remembering my first conference where I knew one other person and wished so bad that someone would come say hey, I decided to walk over and see if they wanted to join us. One of them says to the other, ""Oh GOD, one of them IS coming over here!"" and they both grab their things and leave before I even get to the table. I can only assume they were actually just keeping a lookout for yet another helping of harassment and there I was, barging into their lunch.

2. Sitting in a row of chairs, talking excitedly in jargon to another guy, I notice a woman next to us is looking at both of us and seems to be listening pretty closely. I can't tell if she wants to say something or just wants to listen, so I stop picking up the slack between me and the other guy's sentences to leave some room so at least she doesn't have to yell over us to join in. She motions as if she's about to speak a couple times, looks at her shoes, grabs her things, and leaves, missing the entire event she came for. Cut to me remembering all the times I tried to join a conversation, couldn't quite manage to, didn't get asked anything by anyone, and walked away feeling like I didn't belong.

I know that every person and situation is different, so maybe these kinds of things are just inevitable, but if there's anything to do differently, I'd love to know.",AskWomen,2,1443595625.0,7,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3mxqes/at_work_things_can_anyone_give_some_advice_as_to/
I fear socializing with and disappointing women. How do I overcome this?,"Background: As a kid I lived life in my own little bubble because I was not observant at all, didn't like chatty socializing and was too obsessed with my interests. My dad started to abuse me, I developed a stutter and a lot of acne so my confidence got smashed to pieces. I then made the terrible mistake of going to an all boy's highschool and never made an effort to socialize with anyone because I was horribly addicted to video games and was extremely shy . I was so shy and socially pathetic that I would feel like I was freezing up and/or feel pressure in the back of my head when I walked past a pack of girls. I couldn't look a girl in the eyes to save my life because I was scared and I read too much crap on yahoo answers about how girls don't like being stared at. The few girls I talked to would instantly become quiet and avoid looking at me, so I assumed that girls weren't attracted to me at all.

So when I hit 19 I stumbled upon the idea of body language and social dominance. I went to my library and found a book on each and plowed through them. I had never noticed anything of the sort before because I was always lost in my own world. I didn't really understand what the book was talking about, but I was still curious, so I fixed up my body language and decided to go out into public to try to observe people and read body language. At first making eye contact with a complete stranger was scary as fuck and I felt uncomfortable looking at people for more than a second or two, but as I continued to do it I gained some confidence.

I started making connections between what I had read and what I was seeing with my eyes, and I made this startling discovery: when I stared at women they liked to stare back. At first I was confused (yahoo answers said nothing about this!), but over time I began noticing it more and more and more. I started to notice how girls would play with their hair, look tense when we made eye contact, peak at me out of the corner of their eyes, fix themselves up, instantly look down at the ground when I looked at them, shift themselves to give me a better look of whatever I happened to be staring at and a few brave ones will stare right into my eyes.

Unfortunately, I still don't have the balls to approach and talk to women. Now I feel more pressure on me because I feel like girls will expect me to be some sort of player. I've noticed that when I do talk to women they look at me expectantly and eagerly, and that freaks me the fuck out. Now that I""m more observant I've realized how much attention I get from people, both men and women, and I can't handle this. I've been accused by people of being arrogant, a sociopath, a snob, an asshole, a jerk, etc.. all because I'm too shy to talk to people. I know that the best way to overcome anxiety is to tackle the problem head on. I am trying to work up the courage to start speaking to strangers, but because I'm a piss poor conversationalist I never know what to say to people. What can I say to girls that will make me feel less uncomfortable around them (and them less uncomfortable around me)? Should I randomly compliment girls on the street? What kind of compliments are good ones? What conversation topics are appropriate for a conversation with a stranger (I know next to nothing about what people talk about)? I've missed out a LOT of opportunities due to fear and I don't want to miss them anymore.",AskWomen,0,1387950773.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1tnozo/i_fear_socializing_with_and_disappointing_women/
Hi r/women. 26/m regarding 25/f. Juicy texts I don't want to post but feel it would help clarify. Is this the case of a woman who doesn't know what she wants or am I just missing the bigger picture?,"I have people in my life to talk to about this but I would really love some objective perspective on the matter so I decided to post this. Earlier tonight I had a pretty emotional text conversation with my ex, mainly on my part.

I will try to catch you up on everything and then end with the last text conversation we had. Her and I have been broken up for 2 years. We dated for a year and a half, we loved each other deeply. The last few months of the relationship things just weren't working so I decided to end it (October '10). I said some very nasty things I'm not proud of, I broke her heart and broke us up for good. I regretted it and did what I could the following couple months to win her back. Meaning I did what I thought was right, I gave her time and space to make up her own mind. Every few weeks she would text me and we would meet up and have sex. And every time it was clear she did not want to be with me. Okay, cool. We don't talk for a while. 

Then, 7 months out of the relationship (May '11) she initiates contact again. We have sex. After this she yet again closes herself off to me. I e-mail her and tell her it's not fair she is using me while I'm trying to get over her and tell her to leave me alone. She says she doesn't want to be over me and she is just scared to get hurt again. Okay I say. She goes on vacation and comes back, e-mails me and says that her love for me is not enough, she does not want me back. Okay, moving on.

(January '12). She comes over and we hang out on my bed, catch up for a couple hours and she leaves. (April '12). She comes over and I give her a massage, we end up having sex. I'm used to it at this point so I let her go. (July '12). We end up becoming rock-climbing partners at the gym with some other friends and start to develop our friendship again, things are wonderful. I am enjoying the single-life and confident. (During the rock-climbing time it is announced she is moving out of state in October. I don't think even she knows why she is leaving). After a month she asks to hang out. Cool. She comes over, we have some drinks and have wild sex in the grass (best sex ever). The next few months (August-September) we continue to have the most passionate and incredible sex we've ever had. To the outsider it seems like we might be a couple again, sending cute pictures over text, dates, flirting, sleepovers, having amazing sex and talking for hours afterwards. All of it. 

It's now the end of September, she is having a going away party and I plan on going. The day before the party she comes over to borrow something. She is very cold and distant and won't accept my kiss. Okay, see ya tomorrow? She texts me a few hours later telling me not to come as she wants to avoid drama. I call her and we talk for an hour. She explains she doesn't want to feel inhibited at her going away party and that us acting like a couple is going to make it awkward for her. I understand and tell her that is her choice and I respect it. I then tell her to have a great time and to not contact me again. A few days later she is e-mailing me and texting me about how she is leaving in a week and wants to see me. I have her call me and we talk for an hour. She is crying and telling me how all she has been thinking about the last few days is me and how she wants to see me. She comes over that night and we have amazing sex. Laying in bed together afterwards, she promises to spend next Thursday night (Oct. 11, her last night) with me at my house.

A few days later (this past Saturday) and she has her final going away party at a bar that I attend. The bar closes. We go back to her empty house that we once lived in together and proceed to rip each other apart like animals. We wake up in the middle of the night and go at it again. She drops me off at my car in the morning, Sunday morning. I don't hear from her until Thursday (yesterday), the day she is supposed to come over. She texts me and that is where I will now show the last series of texts we have. Please bare in mind that at the end of our relationship I was incredibly sad that we weren't going to make it, and so I said many terrible things to her about why we weren't right for each other. I realized the mistakes I made and the last 2 years I have shown her only love and kindness. I felt the need to write all of this to give some perspective on why I may have said some of the things I did in the text. When we were texting I had been up for 24 hours and I was very emotional. I guess after 2 years of this shit I just let it all go. I felt like I had to say all of the shit I did and that she needed to hear it. Whether it resonated with her or not is another thing.

http://imgur.com/a/kDG3n

I was incredibly emotional and maybe I went off on her? I don't know. What do you think? I felt the need to write out our history to show how she has been going back and forth on me for 2 years now, and I kind of just finally snapped. I have been to therapists and have never been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. Although I do suffer from anxiety issues sometimes. I know, I've been setting myself up for failure every time for the last 2 years. But tell me what you think. Were my texts that bad? Was her reaction justified? Was she really using me? Have you been through anything like this before? What should I make out of this mess? I don't know how I expected this to end, I wasn't asking her to stay and be with me. I just know I didn't want it to end like this. I wanted us to have great sex and end things with a smile and a wonder on how our lives would turn out. But yet again she pulled away and left me alone wondering what the hell is going on. I'm just looking for any helpful perspective on the matter. Obviously we are cutting off all contact, and at the moment this is all I can really think about right now. This entire situation just feels so wrong to me and I'm hurting. If you made it this far and would like to leave a comment, please do, I'd really appreciate it.

when should i call this girl? (sorry semi long and detailed),"edit 2: problem solved. she texted me. thanks everyone.

tl;dr hung out with a girl for over 24 hours, had sex, when do i call her and what do i say?

a few weeks ago, i met a girl through a friend. we hung out a couple of times with the friend, then a couple of times alone. on friday/saturday, we hung out, did some drugs (the kind that makes two people want to talk to each other) and just talked for like 6 hours. we talked about everything about ourselves, like, everything. at one point she was like 'do you want to hook up at some point', and i just said 'yeah, sure, we could do that', but i didn't make a move. anyway, we started talking again then we drove around (sober by this point) for over 12 hours, non stop, without sleeping (we took like 8 caffeine pills) or eating (we weren't hungry, probably due to said caffeine pills). we visited where she grew up, the places that were important to her, etc, and talked a lot more. we also met up with some people a couple of times for like an hour or two. then we hung out at her house and the total tally for time spent together was well over 24 hours. before we got to her house, in the car, she asked me 'would you really sleep with me?' in like a weird tone. it wasn't commanding, it was kind of like a sad tone. it was weird. i said 'yeah, sure'. anyway, at the end we got to her house, hung out for a bit more, then we had sex, but it wasn't very good because

1) i am not very experienced and

2) i couldn't finish (she finished like 4 times tho). i told her it was because i was tired and hungry (which i was), but i am scared that she thinks it was because i thought there was something wrong with her.

3) we literally sat there for like 10 minutes before i could gather enough strength to make a move and start making out with her, and i could tell it might have bothered her, especially when combined with the me not finishing part. i told her right before i left that 'if you want to do this again, you *have* to tell me exactly what to do, because i don't know what you like', and she just smiled and said 'we'll figure something out'.

i *know* she liked me before the sex and i like her too. could the shitty sex have made her not like me? the entire thing started on friday morning and went onto saturday in the early afternoon. i texted her and asked her early last night about how she was feeling (from the tiredness and/or lack of food). she said she was fine, etc etc.

do i call her today? and what do i say? i ask because i have a habit of appearing too needy and fucking things up, and i really don't want to fuck this up. i also ask because we just hung out for a ridiculous amount of time and maybe she wants her space for a couple of days.



side question: before we had sex (her idea, actually, i didn't make a move), we were making out and i went for her nose instead of her mouth a couple of times; because of the awkward position we were in and also because i was super tired. we made out for like 20 more seconds and at this point she wanted to stop and was like ""i hope you don't treat me differently after this"" and then suggested we take things slow. i was like ""yeah, that sounds like a good idea"". so we just sat on the couch again for a few minutes and i offered her a back rub (wasn't expecting any sex at this point, i just wanted to make her feel better since it had been a long day). anyway, one thing led to another and we ended up not taking it slow and had sex.

my question is this: this girl has a *really dark* past where several people at different times took advantage of her and hurt her really badly. its much darker than a messy break up or anything like that. so as a result, she doesn't really trust men. what could she have meant by 'will you treat me differently'?

my first instinct is that she thinks i will just use her for sex or w/e. this is not even close to being my intention. how do i let her know this other than already telling her? (which i did)

but more importantly, what do i do to make sure she wants to keep me around?

edit: can i replace a call with a text? we have always only texted and never called.",AskWomen,9,1327857386.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/p1tkr/when_should_i_call_this_girl_sorry_semi_long_and/
"Where do I go from here? GF wants ""space"" due to personal problems she has not dealt with in the past.","OK, so here it goes. I am 22, she is 21. I met this girl a couple of years ago and I was taken aback by how pretty and outgoing she was. She had a long term boy friend at the time and we just used to see each other and say ""hi "" etc, but i always would think ah that girl is amazing.. so fast forward to March this year and we get talking again and it turns out she had broken up with her BF of 4.5 years about 25 days ago or something like that. The reason being she wanted time to be on her own and not feel the pressure of a relation ship and that one had just gotten too heavy for her and the guy had just forgotten to have fun any more. She had been drunk every day since then. I looked at her and I wanted to save her because I could see just how amazing she was and really just wanted to be in her company because she is was so infectiously happy and just really cool to hang out with. 

I was pretty sure she didn't want a relationship so we just hung out like mates for about a month without me expecting anything or anything at all. We kept telling each other we liked each other when we were drunk n stuff but would never say anything when we were sober because it was too much of a risk because we were such good friends at the time. Until in mid April I mustered up the courage to tell her I really liked her and she told me she reciprocates that ""like"". In mid may we began becoming officially together. I wasn't sure if this was the right decision for her at the time but she seemed very happy and said that i ""saved her"" from a really dark place in her life and that she really does put that down to me. We are at college and she practically moved into the house that I lived in with my mates. This was brilliant and I had the best few months of my life. She had suffered from depression  and an abusive relationship before me so I knew there could be unsolved emotional issues in the background but I choose to brush over it and keep going with this amazing relationship that we are now in. There were a few warning signs down the line like her not feeling happy with her appearance and not loving her self (even though she is stunning, and that's not just me saying that, she is totally drop dead gorgeous). But she maintained that she was happier than she has ever been so I carried on with it all because by this time i was totally in love with her.

Summer came and neither of us had anywhere to live so we decided to have a room together to save money and for company so we lived alone in a house to ourselves over the summer for like 2.5 months. This was amazing and just worked perfectly. It was perfect and we got on so well and just smoked weed and I did my dissertation over the summer and it was just brilliant. 

After summer she is now in her third year of uni and I have graduated and moved 130 miles away, (a 2 hour train ride). Everything was going brilliantly and she even said about two weeks ago that the distance has made us stronger, which is lovely. She is having a horrible time at uni at the moment because she feels all her friends have left and that her house mates are being bitches to her for no reason. She feels alone at uni even though she does have a circle of friends to be with. So what we said about a month ago is that in January, the first opportunity for me to move back to her area and for her to get out of her house contract, that we would move in together which would be brilliant. Like not for the whole future just like on a 6 month contract and we just see how it goes from there. She seemed totally and utterly on board with this. Our relationship was nothing like I or her (so she told me) had had before and it was just perfect so I didn't see any problems here. Apparently she is much more affectionate with me than she has been with other boys n stuff so that was a really nice thing for me to hold on to as I thought despite us maybe getting into this too fast she really cares for me and sees that this isn't just a stupid little time with me its the real deal. I loved that she would say I saved her from the worst time in her life. I felt so special and tried to make her feel special. Everything in our relationship was equal. We said (right up to like 5 days ago) how amazing it is that we love each other so much and so equally.

Now, like 3 days ago she says that she is having personal problems and she thinks that having a bf at the moment may not be the best course of action. I pressed her on this and convinced her (and she agreed) that in fact it would be better to have me around because I am the one who is there for her unconditionally and will be as long as she wants me. This is the FIRST time I have put my all into a relationship and it felt amazing.

So, yesterday she goes to see her bi-polar mum and depressed sister at her mums house. Her sister and mum are still REALLY good friends with my GF's ex, to the point two days ago he took a cat off the mums hands to look after it for a while. I really don't know what went on last night at her mums or what they were telling her but she is now convinced she has too many personal problems for her to be able to give me the love I deserve. She needs ""space"" to straighhten her head. Now, these problems are not even clear, she says that her sister said she jumped into us too soon and always need to feel that someone loves her and her mum said that my gf doesn't love herself so how can she love someone else. I'm not being funny but this is coming from two people that my gf has always labelled unstable and not particularly sane in any way. She moved out from her house when she was 14 to get away from her mum and now she is taking advice on her life when her mum doesn't even know me very well, apart from I did her massive gardening a few months ago, which was so nice of me. I thought my GF was happy, or at least that our relationship was something in her life that was stable. Which it is THE ONLY thing in my life that is stable at the moment because I have just finished uni and my life is all up in the air to be honest. I was so looking forward to the possibility of us living in the same place in January and stuff and now its all blown up in my face. She was not the only reason I wanted to go back to that town because that's the place I have spent the last 4 years and now call home! she was scared that me and her are the only reason that I am going back there and that puts pressure on her and us, apparently. I don't know why we cant just go with the flow. 

So, what should I do and how does this sound to you, Ladies? I need to know if you think its just her mum and sis that have gotten into her ear or its other things with her ex or I don't know. The thing is I don't want to ask her directly any of these questions as it will push her further away and make this even harder to get back. Do I just not contact her at all? Everything was so happy up until a few days ago so I really don't understand. I's sure the last thing she wants is to date other people, I just know that. Its something she has to deal with on her own but every part inside me just wants to help her. What do I do? I have just said to her I am going to give her space she needs but I am always here for her whenever she needs me. Don't know if I am being a mug though!

Thanks for reading all that (if you did) and your responses would be so much appreciated at this really difficult time. Its been therapeutic just to put it all down like this too. Any follow up questions I will be on my computer most of the day so just ask.

Please help me understand why this girl seemed both very interested and also not interested at all.,"Hi AskWomen,


Male here. I've had an interesting encounter with a woman recently. I don't know what to make of it, other than the typical guy excuse, ""I'll never understand women."" See below for TL;DR.


I met this girl on OKCupid. She wanted to meet up, so we did, and she was really cool so we continued texting each other and went on a few dates. We went downtown to drink, she introduced me to her friends, we chilled at my place and smoked, I took her out for dinner a few times, we saw a movie, watched the IT crowd together, etc. We shared a lot of things in common. I had only made slight physical contact -- holding hands, or hugs, etc -- I didn't feel the need to rush things. All in all things were really great. One afternoon I even surprised her with an impromptu nerf gun fight which I could tell she really really enjoyed.


**About a week later:**


She began flaking out. She wouldn't respond to texts as often or as promptly. We made a date to hang out one night and she cancels right before it's time to meet up because she wanted to do mushrooms with her friends. We try to plan another night but she flaked out on me again later that week. Overall, over the course of the second week, she either stood me up or cut our time short every meetup because of various excuses (mushrooms, need to help mom, etc), which may or may not have been legit.


She eventually stopped texting altogether and eventually, I decided she wasn't worth the effort anymore, so I stopped texting back. I thought this was the end of it, oh well.


**About 1.5 months later:**


I log on to OKCupid. She's online too and sends me a message. Something like, it scared her to death how much her friends said we were a perfect match for each other, etc. She explained that she was struggling with anxiety issues when we stopped talking to each other and that she was a wreck. She also explained that she was kind of seeing another guy when we stopped talking previously. Apparently it was an unhealthy relationship and she was sucked into it because he was depending on her for basic needs. She begged for another chance. 


At some point I expressed my displeasure for being a backup/""Plan B"" guy... she insisted that I wasn't. I wasn't convinced, but did not want to push it. So I continued with caution.


We text back and forth and I attempt to see if she is legit or not. She claims I made her happy; she seemed legit, or at least I thought. So, I say okay, let's give it another shot!


So, we hung out. Things were great and we both had a good time. We planned a follow-up date on Saturday. Saturday didn't happen; some family things again. Okay, more of the same. Well, how about Monday? Monday almost happened: we were texting right up until the point where she was supposed to come over. We were even talking about what we should do when we meet up. Literally we were talking 10 minutes before she was supposed to show up. 


Except she never appeared. Never got any response/text/message or anything from her since then. That was weeks ago. The only reason I know she's not dead is because I saw her in town the other day.


That's the story. All in all, it's very difficult for me to tell if she told me the truth at all or if some/all of it were straight up lies.


**TL;DR -- Met girl on OKCupid, we went on a number of dates, she began to flake out and we stopped talking. She finds me on OKCupid later and asks for another chance with a convincing argument, explains she was in an unhealthy relationship. I gave her a second chance and she flaked out again.**


I have no idea how to explain any of this other than she's insane. Can someone explain to me what was going on in her head? Did I do something wrong to scare her? Did she get tired of waiting for me to put some moves on her? Was I really her ""Plan B"" guy and she found another guy yet again to replace me with? Was she afraid of something? (I assume she wasn't afraid of commitment because she had just gotten out of a multi year relationship)


If it's me, what can I do to avoid having girls do this? I've never had a girl flake out on me so much.

Why do I get so depressed whenever I'm very physically attracted to a girl?,"I'm a socially normal 25m, with zero experience being sexual with girls (grew up in very sex-negative culture that I left a few years ago.) That being said, I've always had an easy time being friends with girls, and am generally considered an emotionally intelligent person. 

People like me as a person, I've just never put myself out there to girls as a sexual/romantic option.

For some reason, I find that whenever I develop a very strong physical attraction to a girl, it instantly triggers all of my insecurities - to the max. Even older insecurities I no longer think about, come roaring back.

While I do have depression and I am in therapy, I cannot understand why an intense physical attraction should be a trigger that instantly drops me into a completely despondent mood.

It's literally like emotional kryptonite for me, to the point where over the years I've almost come to regard intense physical attraction as a threat.

In general, I find that the first step in conquering something like this, is to understand what's going on beneath the surface. But in this case, I'm completely lost (and so are the few people I've discussed it with.)

It's like I can even try to talk to the girl, because that feeling alone is enough to instantly make me not want to talk to anyone.

I know the above paragraph describes depression, but I'm just hoping to decrypt what exactly a serious physical attraction triggers emotionally, that causes a depressed mood.

(Clarification: I say ""intense physical attraction"" to make it clear that I don't mean I walk around trying to avoid seeing pretty girls in the street. For these purposes I'm talking about the few that I've been REALLY attracted to over the years.)

TL;DR Feeling a strong physical attraction to a girl instantly makes me feel depressed, hopeless, and worthless. Why might that be?

Thanks Y'all!

"Super awkward hour with girl I like, how do I make meeting her less awkward?","For about a year now, I've been crushing on a girl in my dorms. I'm a finance guy who's generally very social and has no problems meeting new people, but I absolutely turn to mush everytime I see her. At first I was extremely awkward and would very obviously avoid her gaze (she noticed after a few times), then a few months into the year I noticed she did the same thing with me.

This wasn't a problem all last year because she's from a different floor, but while I was away during the Spring &amp; Summer, this girl became best friends with someone I regularly hang out with!

Recently (following my indoctrination into the dark arts of finance) I've finally gathered the courage to be less awkward and introduce myself, but when we ran into each other in the stairs today, she just smiled, blushed, and quickly ran the other direction, kinda like I was doing all last year.

Unfortunately, she visited my friend this evening and we were in the same room watching tv for a good 2 hours! Most awkward time of my life since I would catch her looking in my direction then turn away, and then do the same thing to her until she caught me.

I think she's interested in me but I'm not sure and I'm also not 100% on whether she has a bf already or not. Next time we run into each while alone should I be like ""wait! Let me introduce myself, I'm xxxxx, I've seen you hanging out with my friend yyyyyy all the time recently"" so its less super awkward?",AskWomen,7,1349320138.0,5,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10wzab/super_awkward_hour_with_girl_i_like_how_do_i_make/
"Strategy, Timing, and Giving Up. (x-post from dating_advice)","I'm a 20 year old guy. I'm confident that I know exactly what will happen, but I'm still torn in cognitive dissonance that it's not what I want, and maybe I want someone to lie to me.

So we begin... &lt;details obfuscated for anonymity&gt;

March, 2012, I move ~100 miles away from home to pursue another career. Part of the rationale for this move is to start anew; to take full advantage of the opportunities of the new city. Well, that was the idea, anyway. I didn't change, but it didn't really bother me that much. Perhaps my quirks and neuroses knew what they were doing.

---

About the first week I was in town, I was exploring different foods (as I didn't have many options in the much smaller city of home) and came across a frozen yogurt shoppe. The girl behind the counter had to be the most disarmingly beautiful girl ever, because I suddenly became addicted to overpriced frozen yogurt. But I didn't mind. I did all sorts of rationalizing and making excuses, all in all completely absent of testes. I think the most tenacious pussying-out I tried was ""she's a symbol of the opportunity of the city. if you go and fuck this up, that'll just give you precedent of failure""... and so I continued getting frozen yogurt, never making a move.

---

Fast forward to June 29th, 2012. I am pulling into the parking lot, and another car pulls in right next to me. This is at a completely arbitrary time of day for a shift change, but it turns out it's &lt;girl&gt;. Apparently she wasn't supposed to work that day, and she had just been called in to cover for her manager. Now, I am fairly nihilistic, and try and avoid drawing meaning from coincidence, but this occasion was way to happenstantial to let go. I order my regular, smile, and just before walking off, I ask her ""Do you want to go flying?"" her face lights up, she presses the feed button on the register, and writes her name and number on receipt paper, and she says ""text me."" and I go, as not to hold up the line. Oh, and I am grinning ear to fucking ear on the way out that door.

---

We go the following Tuesday, and if there was any ambiguity if she was just in it for the flight before, that was gone when I saw the dress she wore. Holy shit that dress. We fly about 30 minutes to a neat airport with a restaurant on the field, and we have a couple ""hundred dollar hamburgers"" and the conversation just flows. It's all looking up. Then we fly back, and have a couple hours before she goes to work, so we decide to get some tea. This girl is smart, challenging, funny, and all other kinds of things that I convince myself of when I'm falling for a crush. Then somewhere in the conversation, I offhandedly said ""oh, like taking 3 months to ask a girl out?"" and she laughed, and said she was glad I did, because she was until about 3 weeks ago in a long relationship. But this is both a wonderful accident of timing, and an awful accident of timing, the awful part is to come on date #2.

---

Date #2, we go to a restaurant downtown that we had talked about the previous date, and it was neat, and the conversation has yet to stop flowing. Afterwards we go see a movie, and we're both determined to not let it end, so we go back to my apartment and watch yet another movie over a couple beers and conversation. Then the best move ever comes up - asking the ""what are you looking for"" question, the question that likes to burn children's toys, and throw salt at slugs. The gist of her answer was that she just got out of a 2 year relationship, and can't feel serious about anyone. She still wants to date, but doesn't want anything exclusive. And that exclusivity clause really put a bad taste in my mouth, and it pointed out an obviously imbalanced relationship as to the goals of the two parties. Yet, I am determined not to fuck up anything, so naturally I just stop talking, and start thinking. Or otherwise do the thing that always fucks things up.

---

I don't text her for 36 hours, and she gets worried, and says she still wants to get to know me, etc etc. and 48 hours later, I basically have come to the realization that it won't work, and yet I wanted to be as strategic as possible in explaining that, in the off chance it might. So begins date #3. Coffee. Initially, I pussy out, and wonder how after 48 hours, I couldn't think what to say. It ends up being just another date, we finish our coffee, completely ignoring the elephant in the room of the previous date, and then go walk around the centre, and wonder what to do. I decide on driving. I end up bringing her downtown, just to look at the city at night (we both like architecture) all the while playing Sinatra and I finally bring up the elephant, however tactfully.


Basically, everything I say she agrees with. She knows it's shitty for me that I fell into the accident of timing, but knows she is still hung up on the last relationship. She's convinced she'd be a horrible person if she started falling for someone else (after a guy basically said he didn't love her and dumped her after 2 years). I maintain my composure, I don't mention that I'm not giving up, and I don't push anything, no matter how much I'd like to. We get to her apartment, and I walk her to her door, and very few words are exchanged. We hug an impossibly long time, both knowing it's shitty how it's ending up, she says ""You're awesome."" I kiss her forehead, and drive home.

---

tl;dr, girl hung up on ex, but only 3 weeks out of 2 year relationship. Should I wait it out or give any more investment? Is there any way of approaching this that isn't self-sabotaging?

Basically, I want to give it time. How much, I don't know. But I don't want this to be so easily resigned to failure.",AskWomen,1,1341790589.0,1,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/w8qk6/strategy_timing_and_giving_up_xpost_from_dating/
Updating An Outdated Wardrobe. Part 2: Office wear,"I’d like to first thank everybody for the great feedback on the first part of this series, I’m glad so many of you found it helpful! One of the more requested categories was office wear, so that’s what I wanted to tackle next. 
 
 





The thing about office wear is that it changes more slowly than casual wear. That means you get more mileage out of your clothes, and you have to think about it less. However, “changes slowly” doesn’t mean “never”. Of course, you may be entirely uninterested in that and in upgrading your work look. And **that’s 100% fine**. 
 
 





*However.*
 
 
 




IF you would like to remain current, there are tweaks that you can eventually make in your work wardrobe. 
 
 






I want to specifically point out that this is not meant to focus on looking TRENDY, but on looking CURRENT. These are not cutting edge trends, these are not trends worn by 18 year-olds. They’re styles that are more updated than, say, 2010 - 2016 office wear. 
 
 






Please keep in mind that updating your work wardrobe DOES NOT mean:
 
 
 




●      That you need to throw out all your existing wardrobe
 





 
●      That you need to dress in a way that doesn’t feel like “you” 
 
 






●      That you’re trying to dress “like a teenager” or in any way non “age-appropriate”
 
 






●      That you’re a slave to trends
 
 






●      That your wardrobe will now be “unflattering”
 
 





 
Updating your wardrobe DOES mean: 
 
 





 
●      Assessing your current wardrobe with a critical eye and identifying what works and what doesn’t
 







 
●      Taking a look at more current/modern fashion styles and picking out some elements that would work for your tastes/wardrobe
 
 







●      Setting some goals for what your ideal wardrobe/look/message is
 
 








●      TRYING THINGS ON before forming an opinion on new styles
 








 
●      Planning your wardrobe for the next few years and making strategic changes/purchases
 
 
 






*Another thing I want to insist on is that everybody’s workplace is different.* That means different expectations, levels of formality, dress codes, and rules. *Every idea/example will not suit EVERY workplace and every dress code.* 
 
 




 
I’m not mandating anything here. I’m simply reporting on what’s current and what isn’t, *for those who are interested*. I tried to include outfits and ideas that run the gamut of formality. It’s up to you to assess which ones would fit your needs and which are inappropriate. 
 
 





 
You also do not need to make ALL the changes. I’m including examples of different clothes and elements, how they may have changed over the years, and what is their more current version, compared to what was fashionable a few years ago. But it’s up to you to swap the elements that make sense for you and that fit in your wardrobe. No one’s telling you to change everything from head to toe, unless that’s what you want! 
 




 
 
###The Basics
 
 





 
Most people aren’t looking to reinvent the wheel when it comes to workwear, and that’s fair. The workplace is not (usually) a fashion show - unless you work IN fashion or an otherwise creative field. But that doesn’t mean you can’t look modern and current, if that’s what you want. Even if you’re keeping your outfits basic, there is still room to update, upgrade, and style an outfit that’s as simple and “timeless” as a white shirt and black pants. 
 
 




 
##The blazer
 
 





Some examples:

[blazer 8](https://www.girlsharestips.com/wp-content/uploads/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-31.jpeg)
 
 






 
The jackets we’re currently seeing are longer and roomier than jackets of yesteryear, more menswear-inspired OR a very snatched-waist Balmain-inspired look that’s come in over the past few years, with an emphasis on power shoulders and a contrast with a smaller waist. The straight cut jacket is long (sometimes even covering the butt), double-breasted, and can be oversized. The new crop of jackets are shorter, go in at the waist, and are either single button or have a single row of buttons, a la [Dior Bar Jacket](https://www.dior.com/couture/var/dior/storage/images/folder-media/folder-productpage/folder-crossselllook/folder-femme/folder-winter-22/block-f_22_4_look_096/35141174-1-eng-GB/f_22_4_look_096_1440_1200.jpg). 
 
 
 



If you feel like your office is too casual for a blazer, you can opt for a more casual material than the classic black suiting. Tweed is always a good choice, you can go for wool, and for a jacket that is patterned, rather than solid-colored. That’s going to look less formal. Suit vests have also been very fashionable in recent years, and they can be a good alternative if a blazer feels too stuffy or is Too Much for your office. 
 
 



 
##The button down shirt
 
 





Some examples:
 







[shirt 1](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/plus-size-fashion-button-down-1660773267.jpg?crop=0.770xw:0.867xh;0.141xw,0.133xh&amp;resize=980:*)
 
 
 





 
[shirt 2](https://40plusstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kimbajeans.jpg) 
 
 
 




 
[shirt 3](https://www.uptowngirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/winter-work-outfits-24.jpg) 
 
 
 





 
Despite what “timeless classics” bloggers would have you believe, a (white) shirt is not, in fact, timeless. Nothing is. Allow me to explain. Yes, the concept of wearing a white shirt will never be “dated” because that’s not how fashion works. An entire category of clothes rarely goes out of style. However, **the specific characteristics** of a shirt can, and do become outdated. Things like the shape and size of the collar, the cuffs, the buttons, and the length and the shape itself are all very specific to a certain era.
 
 





 
The “classic” white shirt from 2003 is tight, short (because it was worn untucked), oftentimes with an oversized and pointy collar and cuffs. The “classic” white shirt from 2010 is longer and straighter, with a tunic collar that does not button up, occasionally meant to be worn with a wide belt on top to emphasize the waist. It was meant to be worn untucked, on top of tight pants. The sleeves had tabs that buttoned up to keep your sleeves rolled up around elbow-level. There might have been some square pockets that were placed too high. We also saw more long, empire-waist tunic-type shirts in this 2008-2012-ish period. 
 
 
 





The “classic” white shirt from 2023 is a generous cut that’s long enough to tuck into your pants or skirt, but not long enough to cover your butt. It should end around your hip. That means that you can also wear it untucked, over your pants, without it looking frumpy. 
 
 




 
Seeing as the fashion is moving towards tighter and shorter shirts (no, we’re not talking about crop tops) to go with the wider bottoms, you can also expect to find more body-conforming shirts in the near future. Shirts with a marked waist, princess seams, and generally a variety of tops that go in at the waist. The blazers and jackets with tapered waists are already present, so we can expect the shirts to not lag too far behind.
 
 





 
##The pants
 
 





 
Some examples:

###Slacks
 
 
 


 
The current standard cut for a pair of office slacks (including suits) is a high-waisted straight leg or wide leg pair of pants, usually full length. Cropped, ankle length pants are still encountered, but usually in culotte, or wide styles, less so skinny pants. The high-waisted cigarette pants (or carrot leg, or peg leg) are still out there, but the style is meant to be a little roomier in the butt and thighs; the office is not the place for your tightest pair of pants. These often come in a paperbag waist style, which is very flattering on a lot of body types, as well as comfortable - because the belt is adjustable. 
 
 




 
The rise is getting lower, however, as low rise is coming back into fashion, meaning that you should be able to find midrise and lowrise pants in wide cuts if that’s what you’ve been waiting for. That won’t change much for footwear, but it might trigger some changes in terms of tops, depending on what styles you’re wearing now. If you were used to tucking shirts into high waisted pants, a low waist doesn’t allow for that. So, you probably need to rethink and re-strategize towards a top that sits untucked, at the top of the hips, for the most traditionally harmonious proportions. 
 
 





 
Nowadays, a lot of pants have elasticated back waistbands, or even entirely elasticated waists or drawstring waists. [Office joggers exist](https://outfittrends.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/plus-size-interview-outfits-5.jpg.webp) for the new iteration of the more casual and relaxed post-pandemic office. Rises and cuts are encountered in generous varieties. There is no reason for a standard pair of slacks to be uncomfortable. And god, are there office pants of all varieties right now. 
 
 




 
(A quick note on fit: 
 




 
Even without stretch, a pair of pants that fits well should not be uncomfortable, should not pinch you anywhere, dig into your stomach, or feel tight or constricting. Size up, go for a straight or wide leg if a tight leg is constricting, and try a higher or lower rise if your waistband cuts into your stomach. Do not purchase the smallest size you can fit into. Bosquerella did [an excellent write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/s6ynwh/psa_being_told_to_size_up_is_the_advice_you_asked) on the matter you can revisit if you need the reminder. Everyone deserves pants that fit. 
 
 





 
Whatever type of rise you’re searching for, I recommend measuring your ideal rise from between the legs and up to where you want it to hit, whether that’s 11 inches, 14 inches, 8 inches, etc. Take a tape measure shopping if you have to. Measure the pants you’re interested in or learn to eyeball it, the name of the style doesn’t necessarily tell you anything about how they’re going to fit ON YOU, because all our bodies are different. Depending on the length of your torso, you may need a different rise than the model does. Shop for your body.)
 
 
 




###Stretchy pants
 
 




 
Leggings have never exactly been business casual, and regardless of their debatable status, they’re just not current anymore. Leggings just don’t read as polished when paired with business casual clothes, and they require a high level of effort in every other aspect of the outfit in order to elevate them and make them presentable and current in the workplace. 
 
 




 
The exception to this is an athleisure look in a workplace that is very casual and allows sportswear. Think tech or non client-facing roles in other industries. And speaking of leggings, let’s address their ugly stepsister, ponte pants. Despite their misleading name, they do not look like pants, let’s be honest. 
 
 




 
If stretchy pants are your go-to, the much better - and more modern - option is a pair of straight leg athletic fabric pants. Straight leg or flared, usually with a front seam or crease and even equipped with pockets, this version at least attempts to mimic the look of regular pants. 
 




 
 
##The heels
 
 





 
Some examples:
 
 



 
[heels 1](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c3/c0/72/c3c072c0a985db820ba609b7af676034.jpg)

While there are still plenty of industries and offices where heels are common or even explicitly required, they are becoming less and less expected. The current heel has changed both in height and in shape/thickness. Thicker block heels are more current than stilettos. A patent, square mid heel will serve you well. 
 
 



 
Heeled mary-janes are currently the IT shoe, and there are variations on the strappy, mid heel style at many different price points. Usually patent - but also leather, for easier maintenance, or satin, for the high-maintenance dressers - mary janes are comfortable, versatile, inoffensive, and come in many different colors at the moment. Sole thickness differs, as does shape, but a lot of them follow the rounded square shape that is currently popular in footwear. 
 
 




 
Boots haven’t gone anywhere, either. A block heel ankle or knee high boot can be perfectly appropriate for the office, as long as the heel isn’t too high and they’re not a very irreverent design. 
 
 




 
##The flats
 
 
 
 
Some examples:

There seems to be a disconnect in mentality where a lot of people think that “trendy” shoes can’t be comfortable. Dressing for comfort doesn’t mean you need to wear basic shoes. I’m about to say something that I know is upsetting for like, 70% of this sub, but it needs to be said: Rothys are not a modern shoe. 
 






 
More supportive shoes are in style, thankfully, and a loafer is much more current and better for your feet. The Gucci-type loafer and the trend it sparked is a little more basic and doesn’t stand out as much. It’s less of a statement, and more of a supporting character in an outfit. The platform loafers, like the Prada ones, for example, are trendier, but they’re also very comfortable. The thicker sole is very supportive and provides good shock absorption if you’re going to be walking miles in them. 
 
 




 
If you want to retain the ballet flat style, the modern ballet flat has a flatter, square shape and dance-inspired detailing that is meant to mimic actual ballet shoes. Pointed toe shoes are also coming back in fashion, and the most modern iteration of a pointed ballet flat is a slingback. 
 
 
 



Mary-janes also have a strong presence among flat shoe styles. One, two, or multi-strap, in patent, leather or canvas, for summer, mary-janes are the perfect feminine, but sophisticated shoe that can work with a variety of outfits, including pants and skirts of varying lengths. 
 
 




 
##The bag
 
 




 
Some examples:

Bags for the office can be tricky, because they oftentimes have to carry your whole life, but still remain professional-looking. That’s one of the reasons why huge, unstructured bags like the LV Neverfull and the Longchamp Le Pliage were popular for so long - they’re not cute, but they’re practical. 
 
 



 
Thankfully, something even better came along, and that is the bizcas backpack. Carrying a laptop, your lunch, your water bottle, your umbrella, and your gym shoes on your shoulder is a one-way ticket to a messed up posture, health problems, and an expensive chiropractor bill. Choose comfort, practicality, *and* fashion by opting for a modern backpack, instead of a gaping nylon bag with thin straps that dig into your shoulder. 
 
 



 
Leather is the most elevated choice, but leather backpacks can be heavy, depending on size and construction, so take your time assessing the best material for your needs. 
 
 



 
###Fun/casual/out of the box alternatives
 
 
 



##The colorful suit
 
 
 



Some examples:

[suit7]( https://fashioncanons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Powersuits-For-Women-Best-Street-Style-Looks-To-Copy-1.jpg)
 
 
 



If you’re in a more formal industry that still expects a suit, the best thing you can do for your work wardrobe is to get yourself a colorful one. Suiting is huge right now - and has been for a few years - so there is no shortage of office-appropriate options that won’t bore you to death. Valentino pink is particularly prevalent as it’s one of the hot colors of the season, but Bottega green is also in, and you can find an entire range of power colors to give you that extra pop. 
 
 



 
If you’d rather play it more subdued, there are plenty of pastel options to choose from. Softer, more feminine, but still 100% professional, pastel suits allow you to cheer up your office wardrobe, particularly for the spring and summer seasons, as these tend to come in summer-weight fabrics. 
 
 




 
##The interesting top
 
 
 
Some examples:
 
 


 
[top1](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/d4/8e/d2d48eb8a0571f48a6879de5934d25f7.jpg)

 [top7](https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/black-jeans-outfit-blouse-and-block-heels.png?fit=728%2C921)
 
 
 


 
If you want a look that’s more elevated, but still retains the same basic neutral top + neutral bottoms formula, all you have to do is tweak the style of the shirt. You can still keep it white, or another neutral shade, but make sure there’s an interesting design to it. You can play with shape - oversized, billowy, straight, cropped, voluminous, etc. - it’s up to you and your preferences, design details - voluminous sleeves, interesting neckline details, contrasting trims or buttons, etc., material - silk, linen, satin (very current), which also impact drape and silhouette. 
 
 
 



Again, color is not something you need to shy away from in the workplace, especially if you’re going to pair it with neutrals. There is nothing about colorful clothes that is inherently unprofessional (unless you work at a funeral home). If a top is professional in white, it’s also professional in blue, or magenta. A “spicy” shirt can be the visual interest you need in an otherwise drab work outfit. 
 
 


 
##The midi skirt
 
 
 


Some examples:
 






[midi 1](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62d1ac8b005fcb0457a8d85f/1673157327421-NKD71A84YLVYYHVJ3TZQ/maxi+skirts+-+%40SYLVIEMUS_.jpg?format=2500w)

[midi 7](https://www.girlsharestips.com/wp-content/uploads/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-44.jpeg) 
 
 






 
[midi 8](https://blog.petitedressing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/loafers-17-473x1024.jpg)
 
 





 
You may have noticed that in recent years, THE skirt/dress length has been the midi. Reaching around mid calf, the midi oftentimes has a medium to long leg slit. BUT there are simpler and less sexy versions for the office. The shape is straight or conical, rather than the A-line accordion pleated midis we saw around 2016. However, it’s not the tight pencil skirt shape of the 2010s, either. Think more body-skimming, rather than a spandex-y bodycon. 
 
 
 




In addition to being very current, the midi is very office-friendly because of the conservative length. It goes great with heels, but it also looks good with flats, especially the more modern chunky shoes. A midi skirt can be worn with a classic button-up shirt, or a thin turtleneck, a chunky knit, a t-shirt for more casual offices, and it can even be taken out for drinks or shopping after work or on the weekend. A very versatile piece that can work hard in your wardrobe for the next few years. 
 
 




 
The danger with a long skirt is to not veer into frumpy, church-y territory. If you’re going for a midi look, I recommend styling it in a very intentional way, with some very modern accessories. A midi skirt with a thin-soled ballet shoe from 2012 and a long, thin cardigan might look frumpy and awkward, but a midi with a chunky loafer and an oversized blazer looks like an intentional outfit. Same with boots - forego the heeled low cut ankle boot and instead, opt for a chunky knee-high boot. It can also look very chic with a longer, oversized, chunky knit.
 
 




 
Another way to make sure it’s not reading frumpy is to pick a modern fabric. Leather skirts are very in right now, as are satin slip-style skirts. In the right cut and in a high-quality material, they can be professional, while still remaining stylish. 
 
 

 
##The sneakers
 
 



 
Some examples:

The main aspect people appreciate about wearing sneakers is that they are comfortable. But if you’re looking to update your work wardrobe, you should know that Allbirds-style shoes are an outdated style. A black pair *could* be somewhat neutral, especially combined with a [chic, modern all-black outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/20/30/1a/20301a413d025332047845afbb6871c8.jpg). 
 
 
 



But there are equally comfortable sneakers out there that are sleeker, more modern, and more professional. You don’t have to wear the chunky dad sneakers your 15 year-old is wearing, but a sleek, white sneaker with a clean shape that’s not overly stylized or embellished is a perfectly respectable choice that will bring your work style closer to 2023. No synthetic mesh, please.
 
 



 
If you feel like white is too stark and stands out too much as an athletic shoe, black is always a safe choice. If you can afford to be really daring in a casual office, you can even try a pair of platform converse. They’re not just more current, but they’re also much more comfortable, because the sole isn’t as thin and lacking in support as the classic version. Plus you get a tiny bit of height, even without heels. 
 
 
 



##The jeans
 
 


 
Some examples:
 





[jeans1](https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/248544/cute-outfits-with-black-jeans-248544-1603664436620-image.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&amp;quality=70)

Jeans in the workplace were once a hotly debated matter and it may still depend entirely on your specific office. But in a post-covid world, where so many are reluctant to even go back to the office at all, dress codes have relaxed and jeans are more prevalent than ever before. And why shouldn’t they be? A good rule of thumb for wearing jeans in the office is to stick to a pair that is non-distressed, and solid-colored. No rips, stone washing, or fading and whiskering. Black, dark blue, or mid-blue are all okay colors. Maybe even white, in the summer. 
 
 



 
For an updated outfit, the new styles of jeans are all very workplace-friendly, because they don’t cling to the body so tightly like skinny jeans did, so they’re not emphasizing anything that an old white man might be offended by or overly taken by. There is no reason why a pair of straight leg or wide leg jeans shouldn’t pair great with a shirt, a sweater, a blazer, and a pair of loafers for a casual office environment. I’d stick to jeans that are actually hemmed, and not distressed, but at the same time, your legs are mostly under a desk, so only you know what you can get away with!
 
 



 
#Modernize your office fit
 
 



 
Finally, let’s look at some typical, average office fits you’d see 10 years ago, and how we can retain the same basic, reliable structure, but with updated pieces. Allow me to remind you that we don’t need to throw out the clothes in the outdated examples and replace them all with clothes from the updated ones! You can get more mileage out of your clothes if you mix and match with some more modern pieces. 
 
 



 
##sweater + black pants





 
[do this](https://www.uptowngirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/winter-work-outfits-22.jpg)
 
 







[instead of this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e0/52/52/e05252880ffbc9de47d0d72033d07b7c.jpg)
 




 
 
The cut matters so much in an outfit, as you can see in these examples. We’re still retaining the exact same formula, but we’re simply updating the pieces. While it’s still a big, oversized gray sweater, the style becomes chunkier, with balloon sleeves. 
 
 




The black pants are flared instead of skinny, which is a more modern cut. The boots aren’t almond-toe, but pointed, and they match the other light-colored accessories. 
 






## long top/sweater + leggings + flats

 




[do this](http://ladyfashioniser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-sweater-black-leggings-and-white-sneakers.jpg)

If your office is casual enough, you may still be able to get away with wearing leggings. Rather than pairing them with ballet flats, opt for a pair of sleek sneakers. You can still keep the white shirt and the knit format, but update to a chunky knit sweater, instead of the thin cardigan. Accessorizing with a big scarf indoors is unnecessary, unless it’s cold. If you want to keep the accent scarf, opt for a thinner silk square scarf, instead. 
 







##top + cardigan + slacks




 
[do this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/39/7f/1e397fbcc564ef0395c88b3c3df5bf10.jpg)

This is a great example of how you can still wear your long cardigans in a much more modern fit. If you look at the first example, that short, tight cardigan on top of a tight top makes it look like the cardigan doesn’t fit her properly; it’s straining on her body. That’s never a flattering fit. The looser cardigan with a more generous cut in the second example allows for a more comfortable fit. 
 




 
The belt is present in both examples for waist emphasis, but tucking the top inside the pants rather than letting it hang on top is an instant update you can easily make to your everyday fit. If you prefer an untucked top, that’s perfectly fine, but choose a looser fit and not a tight jersey top. 
 
 




Accessories also irrevocably date an outfit. The chunky statement jewelry can easily be swapped for simpler pieces that subtly enhance and highlight, rather than being the focus of your overall fit. 
 
 
 



##sweater + jeans

If you’re gonna do a knit with jeans for work, you can easily update the look. Swap the skinnies for a pair of straight leg jeans. The riding boots or ankle boots can be changed into combat boots or a chunky pair of oxfords, and the knit can be swapped for a chunkier, either cropped or oversized sweater. Or you can opt for an oversized knit vest. It’s worn over a t-shirt in this example, but it works beautifully over a long-sleeved button-up shirt, or even over a tight turtleneck. 
 




 
##dark suit + heels








[do this](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/plus-size-fashion-power-suit-1660766422.jpg?crop=0.927xw:0.952xh;0.0578xw,0.0314xh&amp;resize=980:*)

The basic suit has changed shape, with slim ankle pants being less current than straight, long pants with a crease. The blazer is longer, less fitted, and more oversized, and the heels have more of a square toe (or a more elongated point), rather than the short pointed heel in the first example.

As you can see, sometimes it’s just a matter of styling. The two examples aren’t that different, just slightly updated. The jeans are no longer skinny, but straight-cut. It’s still a style that conforms to your shape, just more modern and less constricting. The shirt is tucked into the jeans, instead of a long, untucked shirt. We still keep flat shoes, but we choose something with a platform. 
 
 





Again, opting for minimal jewelry over the chunky, statement necklaces will instantly make your otufit feel fresher and more modern.

Advice on how to wear what I want but cope with sexual harrassment,"Hi!

I know that women are sexually harassed regardless of what they wear, but I assume that we'll get more attention when we wear revealing clothing. I often find myself covering up to decrease this attention, but my taste in fashion includes more revealing (or just eye-catching!) clothing. 

Do I just have to suck it up and feel unsafe? Is this just the necessary trade-off (wearing what I want vs unwanted attention), given what the world is like?

How do you guys cope with this?

Edit: thanks everyone for sharing your tips, personal stories and hugs. I struggle with this feeling because I don't know when this ""fact-of-life"" ""need"" to protect myself transitions into self-victim-blaming (and normalises victim-blaming in general). You've given me a lot to think about. 


In terms of ""coping"", it's helping me to re-think ""vulnerability"" - 1) looking vulnerable/unlikely to fight back [which to everybody who has been put in a spot, I'm so sorry, and it's so difficult]; 2) feeling vulnerable and shrinking in on myself for it. I found the comments encouraging, to take up space (and wear what I want) with confidence, to not let creeps take that away from me, and even deter them with still more confidence. All the practical tips for when I still feel scared and unsafe were also very much appreciated &lt;3 thank you everyone ",femalefashionadvice,870,1615553031.0,213,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/m3gs33/advice_on_how_to_wear_what_i_want_but_cope_with/
A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",femalefashionadvice,1164,1633206251.0,134,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/q02p1i/a_guide_to_making_your_fast_fashion_clothes_last/
Translating inspiration styleboards into a wearable wardrobe (with examples!),"Have you meticulously curated a Pinterest board or folder of photos for fashion inspiration and absolutely love the aesthetic you’ve found, but realized that all the outfits in the photos are too impractical to directly translate to your lifestyle?

You can still definitely infuse your own wardrobe (or start a new one, if you're in the process of doing an overhaul) with some fantasy style. Just because you need or want a smaller capsule wardrobe doesn't mean it needs to be full of white button-down shirts, black trousers, nude pumps, and LBDs.

Focusing on building a wardrobe rather than constructing as many individual outfits to be as evocative of the theme as humanly possible makes the style more wearable and easier to integrate with other sorts of pieces that are either more minimal and casual or of another style.

**There is a FAQ after the examples discussing a few things like “Do I need to have just one style? Do I need to define my style(s) to Fashion properly?”**

Edited again on 7/16 to clean up formatting and add *more* detail, after a detour of the post getting removed by automod because I accidentally added a url-shortened youtube link.

[**Now with downloadable pdf version of this guide**](https://mgetsdressed.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/translating-inspiration-styleboards.pdf) (sans the examples because then it would be 50 pages with all the photos, but I've updated to include some small written examples at each section)! Thanks u/katie-didnot for suggesting I make one.

## What this is

This is a pretty long post, but I hope that this guide can give anyone who feels lost trying to pull the aesthetic of a more fantastical inspiration boards into their actual outfits without feeling like they’re wearing a half-assed cosplay a detailed framework and concrete examples to help make that happen.

I enjoy making inspo boards and sometimes come up with wardrobes for them. Sometimes it’s an entirely virtual wardrobe, sometimes I like to see what I can come up with just from my existing closet, and sometimes I want to change up my style a little and will get more things. 

These are the sorts of things that I look for when analyzing any inspiration board. I find that for so many things in life, starting from a checklist can help a lot. Since this is a creative endeavor, there are a lot of ways you could do this. If you have another method that works for you, I’d love to hear about it in the comments! I personally love organization, structure, lists, that sort of thing, so this way has worked well for me.

## What this is not

Magic – If you want to look like you're wearing super dramatic period pieces or extravagant costumes in your inspiration board, but don't actually want to wear literally these things, you are not going to look *exactly* like the original board. We're still going to end up with an interpretation, not a direct ""how to cop this exact look"" outfit.

A shopping guide – Items shown were selected purely on visual merits and from coming from stores that provided clear stock photos for illustration purposes.

A complete wardrobe overhaul guide – See the [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2sz2lo/so_you_want_to_do_a_wardrobe_overhaul/) from the sidebar for great advice on how to go about that. I also recommend reading “The Curated Closet” by Anuschka Rees which is what the sidebar guide is based on. A lot of this post has roots in the methods from the book, though I’ve emphasized what I’ve personally found helpful as well as added content including some outfit styling tips. The book goes over a lot more areas related to wardrobe overhauls, such as learning how to shop mindfully and evaluate clothing fit, as well as going into more detail on things that are just briefly discussed here, such as closet composition.


Examples attempt to be somewhat comprehensive in broad categories of clothing but are not aiming for 100% coverage of clothing for every activity life could throw at you.

A gold standard for inspiration albums. I do include some boards because that’s the whole starting point, but the focus on this was more on the process of distilling a style based on looking at elements like fabrics and cuts and not how to make a great album featuring a diversity of bodies and designers. I was also lazy and didn’t copy all the individual images into an imgur album (just a shot of the whole board), but if you’re doing a standalone inspiration post you should do that because then people can see the images more easily.

# Distill the elements of your inspiration board

When taking notes for this section, avoid vague terms like “ethereal” or “1970s”. Go for concrete details like “low square necklines” or “monochrome tie-dye”. You can use the more vague terms to group details together, but most of the list should be things that you can literally search for online, or something that is an instantly identifiable property of an item.

**What are the recurring visual elements in the style board?**

Since you’re going through all this because most of the items in the board aren’t directly wearable for your lifestyle, you want to start off looking at more basic properties of the style. For example, it’s easier to look for something if you’re looking for a “light colored longline wool(-blend) coat with faux fur collar/cuffs” than “something that feels like a snow queen would wear it”.

* **Colors and prints** Get really descriptive with your notes on prints. For example, if there are polka dots, are they large, bold, randomly placed polka dots or tiny evenly-spaced polka dots? Is animal print a realistic pattern or stylized? Does the print have crisp edges or is more painterly? Are the colors high contrast or muted?
  * In addition to noting specific colors, I like to identify types of colors that works for the style because when shopping it is usually impractical to literally only buy five exact shades. For example, cool-toned pastels and deep jewel tones, saturated earth tones, or warm greys.
* **Fabrics** Note general fabric properties. Structured and crisp suiting fabrics? Earthy fabrics like heavy linen? Diaphanous fabrics like mesh and lace? Are there a lot of technical/performance fabrics (i.e. athletic fabrics). Pay attention to fabric weight, drape, and texture, even for things like t-shirts.
* **Silhouettes** What common outfit silhouettes are there? Which parts of the body are emphasized and de-emphasized? Are shapes more organic and slouchy, or tailored? You can get a bit more clothing specific here where it makes sense, as some descriptors are only applicable to a particular category of clothing, e.g. “wide leg pants”, so we can start getting more specific here). For example, “sharply emphasized shoulders in a structured silhouette that defines the waist”, “a soft columnar silhouette with long dresses that lightly skim the body with lots of fabric”, “structured cropped outerwear over a very fitted top and slouchy pants”, or “sack silhouette that leaves no idea of the body shape, but with fitted sleeves / sleeveless”.
* **Motifs** A catch-all for any other notable (but specific!) details. For example, “celestial objects” (if they appear a lot in jewelry and as clothing embellishments but aren’t exactly a print) or “visible mending”.
* **Styling choices** How is the clothing worn can also make or break a look.  Are tops always tucked in? Are they tucked in neatly or in a looser partial way? Are shoes always worn with visible socks? Are pants cuffed or shirtsleeves rolled up? Are tops buttoned up all the way? Is there always a ton of layers? Is jewelry bold or minimal? Is hair worn down and loose or up? Does hair have volume or is it kept sleek/short? Is there visible makeup? Is it graphic or soft and blended?


**What makes this distinct from other similar styles?**

What subset of the visual elements should we focus on to keep the style intent more obvious? Thinking about what not to include can be as helpful for keeping the style distinct as what to include.

For example, if you have a “queen of the night” board and decided you will be wearing all black, how will you keep your look distinct from other commonly black monochrome aesthetics? You could note to avoid denim and t-shirts (especially together), and to try and avoid completely unembellished outfits (the queen of the night is not a ninja).


# Note requirements of your lifestyle

What constraints does your lifestyle put on your wardrobe? E.g. Is this capsule for work, weekends, or both? Are you in a business casual office? Have an active job? Bike commute? What’s your tolerance for fussing with clothes? Is dry cleaning okay? Do you go clubbing? Attend operas? How often? Do you have fluffy pets that shed a lot? Young children?

Note hard requirements to put on clothes based on these lifestyle. E.g. no fabrics that collect or show lint easily, machine-washable and dryable fabrics only, only items that have enough stretch you can bend over and do squats easily, nothing that requires special undergarments to look nice, long sleeves must be able to be pushed up, no skirts or pants that drag on the ground, nothing that requires a very specific kind of tuck to look nice.

You can keep some distinction for special occasion clothes, but be realistic. If you are at work or at home or doing something active outdoors 97% of the time, if you want to minimize the number of items which collect dust in your closet, aim to buy everything to fit into your criteria.

Write that all down.

# Identify specific items make the biggest impact

What specific pieces do you think would make the biggest impact for this style? These will likely be more distinct types of clothing (e.g. flare pants, military style jackets, wide-brimmed hats) that appear in multiple images, or a detail (e.g. plaid fabric, embroidery) that appears in multiple pieces.

Be specific but not so specific you have no hope for finding the item at all lest you get it custom made. Think along the lines of detail in “plaid wide-leg or loose tapered trousers” or “heavy boots with a lot of hardware”. Write down anything you think could work, and note whether there’s a range of colors you’d like to find it in, or are set on finding it in a specific color.

For any pieces that do not work with the list of lifestyle requirements, try and think of a similar item that still has the same feeling. For example, if your board has lots of people wearing pointed toe stilettos but you don’t wear heels, you could add leather pointed toe flats or boots. Sometimes there might not be any obvious toned-down version for an item, but that’s okay. There are so many dimensions of style to work with that you can always incorporate something else.

# How do you actually find stuff once you have a list?

This is a bit of an art, and it’s a combination of knowing the pure elements you want and finding some brands that tend to make that style.

It generally helps to know more fashion vocab, so you can search particular shops or on Etsy or ebay. The easiest way to do this is to image search for “types of { collars / sleeves / skirts / etc }” and take a look at some infographics.

If you have no idea what shop to start with, use the shopping tab on Google or search in shopping aggregators like Lyst.

If you find one brand that fits the style, find their Instagram and see if they follow similar brands. If they have a hashtag on instagram, see what other brand hashtags people who wear that brand use.

Err towards looking at a lot of stuff and bookmarking it and filtering things down later. If the style you're chasing is incredibly specific, it's unlikely you'll find a brand that caters to it exactly.

# Building a well-rounded wardrobe

As you’re looking for new pieces, consider the role each item plays in an outfit. Is it more of a statement or a base piece? Is it a shirt/bottom/outerwear/shoe/etc? Is that a niche that is filled in the items you have already?

Try and fill out categories of clothing evenly. If you have 10 items of new style that you’re mixing with 50 items of your old style but 7 of the new items are blouses in the same color family, that’s probably not going to make as much of an impact as if you had a few bottoms, a piece of outerwear, a pair of shoes, and some accessories mixed in.

## Notes on color palettes

In my opinion, keeping a limited color palette is the easiest way to get a cohesive feel in a wardrobe that may otherwise be eclectic.
A limited color palette doesn’t necessarily mean a neutral palette. You can pick neons and cool neutrals, colors that remind you of a tropical vacation…. you name it. Just keep constraints on some dimensions of the color.

Color can also be used to create a sense of variety in a smaller wardrobe. To create more depth in the capsule using color, you can include at least one color each that’s dark, medium, and light value.

Check that the color variety isn’t just in one category of your wardrobe. Try and have as much of your palette as possible in each category (i.e. if all your tops are colorful but all the bottoms are dark, that still won’t feel like much variety).

# Integrating a new style into your existing wardrobe

It’s fine to keep items for this new style as a separate mini capsule within your wardrobe. But if you want to be able to integrate them without looking too eclectic, I recommend sitting down with the list of key items you've identified and a shortlist of your most-worn clothing (a simple paper list or spreadsheet with one column per clothing category works great) and considering how things could work together in different combinations. e.g. if you are deciding what type or color of top you could get, think about whether it would work with at least 3/5 of your most-worn bottoms.

Depending on your wardrobe, the style you’re trying to add, and what level of eclecticness you’re cool with, tasteful integration with your current wardrobe may not be feasible and you may want to just keep the new style as a small capsule within the rest of your wardrobe.

Definitely don't buy a new wardrobe in a month! Start with getting a few items (I'm talking like, 2-3 things) and see how you feel from there. Again, if you’re doing a wardrobe overhaul, the [guide in the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2sz2lo/so_you_want_to_do_a_wardrobe_overhaul/) outlines some advice for that excellently.

# Finding a balance of wearability and drama in outfits

We’re essentially aiming to half-ass the style on the original board. But to look intentional, half-ass it evenly in the whole outfit. Keep the parts of the outfit at similar levels of formality. Items don’t have to be exactly the same level of extra, but it will look more cohesive if they are all about one level of formality of each other.

Zoe Hong’s video “How to Design From Runway to Real Life” (being extra careful not to offend the AutoMod again with a shortened link – her channel is youtube.com/zoehongteaches) goes over a lot of elements that can make things more or less wearable. It’s written with an audience of design students in mind rather than consumers, but the concepts are all solid. Formality of clothes in women’s fashion is much less clear cut  than in men’s fashion, but generally fabric will determine a lot of it. i.e. Just because it’s a dress doesn’t mean it’s formal. A stretchy knit cotton sundress is less formal than a cotton poplin sundress, and a dress in the same cut with tiers of eyelet lace would be  more festive.

If you’re going to err towards more disparate levels of extra in the items used in one outfit, I find that grounding the look (literally) with shoes that have visual interest often makes the whole thing look more intentional. Doesn’t mean you have to wear bedazzled heels, but the shoes should have visual weight and contribute to the style of the outfit. For example, flat leather oxfords, pointed toe boots, or chunky strap flatform sandals all have more visual interest than your standard pair of low-profile black sneakers or flip flops but are still being wearable relative to a lot of the shoes you find in Pinterest outfits.

Another method that you can try is rather than starting with a plain outfit and swapping in or adding more fanciful pieces, you can initially go all out with the look and then remove (or swap out for a more low-key version) a few accessories or base items until you feel comfortable.

I included three examples. The first is more on the extreme side in terms of starting point and endpoint because I feel that makes for a clearer example. It’s a complete but small wardrobe and the outfits are shown as polyvore style collages because I obviously am not going to actually buy a wardrobe's worth of stuff for a reddit post.

The latter two are like the FFA Inspo Album Starter Pack (I mean that as a term of endearment) and use items that are a subset of my actual wardrobe. The first one is more of an “I don’t want to go through this whole damn list exactly step by step, but I can more or less get the idea” example. I generally follow this process when doing my own wardrobe remixes now that I've done it so much I don't need a literal checklist, but in the last example I really go all out picking apart the board details just to show the kinds of things you can notice and decide whether to incorporate into your own look.

I chose more popular ones because since these are the sorts of styles I’ve seen a lot of inspo posts for over the past few years, I’m familiar with, and I could actually put some outfits together with using mostly stuff I had already. If you’ve got your own board and a list of some items you decided to get based on it, I’d love to see them!

## Example 1: Victorian garden party, but make it athleisure
When your inner self is eating muffins and sipping tea with the characters of The Importance of Being Earnest but you work from home and are very active and have no tolerance for any sort of clothing that doesn't have high stretch.

This one just uses stock photos but I did collage the stock photos into outfits to give a better idea of how they could go together.

* Inspiration: [Imgur screnshot](https://imgur.com/PKtatXV) and [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/ter4gr4m/tea-time-style/)
* Items and Outfits: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/kdNONqw) More detailed explanation of how I chose different types of items are in the imgur album. You can find the items and outfits as subsections on the Pinterest board linked above.

### Recurring Elements
* **Colors:** creams, whites, beige, pastel floral colors, quite a lot of green and lighter blue – think of a lovely spring day
* **Fabrics:** Sheer layers, lace, airy fabrics, silk
* **Silhouettes:** Nipped in waists, full skirts, high necklines or sharp v or square necklines, graceful gathers and drape, voluminous sleeves
* **Styling Choices:** Hats! Hats were an integral part of outfits back in the turn of the century. Skirts and sleeves are poofy, but there aren’t really layers.

### Distinguish from other styles

There’s going to be a fair amount of overlap with any sort of aggressively soft and feminine style, but to give the wardrobe a bit more focus, we can decide on some things we are not going to include in order to reduce elements that may skew it in other directions.

* **Ballet style:** Soft frothy pastels and floral motifs and athletic cuts are also strongly associated with ballet. In order to steer a bit away from this, let’s avoid anything with mesh or sequins.
* **Lingerie-inspired style:** Corsetry and yards of lace are both elements that conjure images of fluffy Edwardian blouses and parasols. However, if we are going with more skintight athletic wear items, then these can easily move into a lingerie aesthetic, so let’s avoid lace-up and lace elements.

### Misc notes

I actually started out focusing on creams, pinks, and purples, but realized it would read a bit too “gendered childrens clothing line”, so I decided to add the blues and greens.

Another thing I did here to keep things simpler was limiting the floral prints to accessories and bottoms, but avoiding tops. I felt that floral tops was the more pedestrian choice (I’m being DRAMATIC and CREATIVE here), so I limited it to pants and accessories. I think this also makes it easier to mix-and-match because you rarely have to worry about clashing prints if they’re all in pants.

### Specific things to look for

In this example since I decided to stick to athleisure it was simple enough to just search for floral prints and colors within the palette. For accessories I wanted to include some more direct references, so I looked into straw and canvas bags, a wide-brimmed hat, and a porcelain tea set inspired water bottle.

## Example 2: Your basic witch
This is basically the recurring summer goth/witch themed inspo that pops up periodically.

Here tbh I just got lazy but figured it would be good to have one shorter and less “Are you crazy?? Who’s gonna go through all these steps and detail????” example anyway.

Looking at the inspo board on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/ter4gr4m/warm-weather-witch/) (or a screenshot of it on [imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aUJpxvO.png)), we can see it’s a pretty traditional dramatic romantic goth sort of style with all black, with a bent towards a medieval historical style rather than more punk-y goth.

Say we’re starting with a casual wardrobe that’s mostly black already, but is pretty plain so no one would take a look and be like “YES this definitely has low-key witchy vibes.”

If the spring/summer basics are basic black denim shorts, jeans, and a jersey maxi skirt, plain sandals, and boots and I don’t really want to go full out queen-of-the-night-wears-valentino because I like stretch skirts and denim, then the place to try and incorporate the style would be in tops and accessories.

If I have the 3 bottoms mentioned above that I want to incorporate and get 2 more fun and themed (i.e. more elaborate or sheer fabrics, or silhouettes with dramatic poofy sleeves and/or severe medieval dress style square necklines) tops that go with all of them, then that’s 6 outfits and if you’re only wearing these on weekends that’s already a great set to work with, especially if you add options for accessories. You can have a lot of fun with a particular style even if you don’t have a giant collection of items for it.

The most obvious accessories to add would be a black wide-brimmed hat and a purse that has more elaborate details on it. Silver-toned boho jewelry would also work, as well as some more fashion-y sunglasses (e.g. circle style or cat-eye style instead of aviator).

I also shamelessly love witchy styles. This year I decided I think the more maximalist version is a lot more fun than the minimal sack-dress woodsy style, so I got 2 tops that were more on theme. I wanted to get more feeling of variety so I got a long sleeved off the shoulder blouson sleeve top and a square-neck sleeveless crop top. I think a lace-up corset closure would be more on-theme than a zipper, but I’ve tried lace-up styles before and I personally don’t like wearing them. I like how this top is reminiscent of stays (as in the corset-like things) but the zipper keeps it from being too ren faire anyway. (I already had a black sun hat).

[**Et voila, a few outfits.**](https://imgur.com/a/IZbLSrM). More obviously inspired by the board than a black ribbed tank top and the same bottoms, but also wearable in a casual setting.

## Example 3: 1920s-1940s adventurer style

You know those posts. The perennial Indiana Jones / Lara Croft inspired posts.

**Inspiration, items and outfits:** [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/pAS81H2) (more details on how I chose items and put together outfits in the album). [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/ter4gr4m/old-school-banana-republic-style/) (just inspo).

### Recurring Elements

TLDR: earth-toned vintage military-inspired style with a relaxed but practical feel.

* **Earth tones:** Obviously. Olive, khaki, beige/cream, browns of various shades. Some black, but it’s not a dominant neutral. Think National Park Service.
* **Sturdy natural fabrics:** All over the catalogs you see them bragging about how the properties of the cotton, linen, wool, and leather items of various kinds will aid you on your adventure. Not the sort of technical materials you’d get from modern workwear and activewear brands. (For the record, I don’t hate synthetics on principle. They just don’t make sense here.) There are still soft fabrics, but nothing diaphonous or delicate.
* **Comfortable silhouettes:** a bit loose to accommodate movement because spandex wasn’t really a thing in clothes back in our era of inspiration, but not so loose that things will catch on vegetation or machinery. I didn’t want to comb through all the scans to dig it up, but the copy from one of the catalogs advertising a skirt said something to the effect of “loose enough to take long brisk strides in without catching between the legs”.
* **Military details:** A lot of this style is closely related to the military (i.e. pilots) or is just so utilitarian in bent that military surplus makes sense. 
* **Vintage styling:** The catalogs cite inspiration anywhere from the Victorian era through the 1980s (they did actually sell t-shirts in addition to stuff like that embedded scans), but from what I can tell focuses on the elements of 20s through 40s. With an 80s bent, for example they have so many sweater dresses and shirt dresses with wide belts over them. So this means mostly structured and tailored items and more classic style shoes like lace-up boots and oxfords.

### Specific items and styling details that could work

* **Boots:** A lot of the modern inspo photos feature Doc Martens boots, which also work with the military inspiration. Shoes are generally comfortable and on the sturdy side, and are lace-up. Chelsea boots would work too.
* **Loose trousers:** Specifically jodhpurs, but we can assume that we’re not going to be walking around casually in those any time soon, but trousers that are relaxed around the thighs then tapered down can have a similar vibe. Wide-leg 40s trousers also appear. There aren’t really any leggings or skinny pants. Jeans were a thing in the 40s and definitely appear in a lot of working women historical photos, but I think going hard enough on the vintage pieces to pull a look more old-timey with jeans will usually end up looking like a costume or a 50s pinup style so I’d just avoid it.
* **Midi skirts:** Not mini skirts (might as well wear shorts) or maxi skirts which would be a trip hazard. Crisp styles rather than breezy or boho styles.
* **Belts.** Belted everything! Very 80s with the dresses.
* **Aviator-inspired bomber jackets, shearling jackets**: Optional: those leather flight caps and goggles :P 
* **Safari/field jackets**
* **Linen/cotton button-down shirts, beige/white or olive.** This + khaki or olive bottoms are core pieces. Henley shirts or plain tops can also work, more of an off-duty sort of vibe.
* **Hats:** structured hats like panama hats, in straw or wool. Probably wanna avoid anything that looks like a literal pith helmet.
* **Bandana/scarf** for hair or around the neck.
* **Heritage/Fisherman sweaters**
* **Jumpsuits and safari/utility dresses**
* **Vintage aviator style watches**
* **Leather/canvas backpacks and messenger bags**

For modern looks, a balance between vintage-inspired and modern. If pants are more modern (e.g. plain trousers vs pleated trousers), pair with a more old-timey top. If the top and bottom could be just any old outfit, add a hat + statement vintage shoes.



### Distinguish from other styles

So at a certain level of dilution, any original inspo can and will read more vaguely. But some things to think about:

* **[Soft prairie](https://i.imgur.com/WcLfHpl.jpg) / romantic / Victorian undergarments style:** At least one of top/bottom should be more structured. So a soft romantic vintage style top like the one in the linked photo could work with more structured pants (like the free people crop wide-leg pant from above shown again [here](https://i.imgur.com/KTSxaSY.jpg)). Or the pictured skirt could work with a utility/camp button-down.
* **Socialite on vacation in the Mediterranean style:** These two images show items/outfits that are pretty close, but not quite sturdy enough to feel adventure-y. [The first](https://i.imgur.com/NalDpIw.jpg) is more of a loungewear jumpsuit and while the [second outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a5/95/25/a595256988539ae346fb99454a5df08e.jpg) is pretty close, the shoes don’t exactly look like they’re made for going places even though they’re flat. Open shoes can work, but I think something more heavy-duty like Birkenstocks fit better.
* **Just straight-up military inspired style:** I think by nature a lot of the pieces or outfits individually could be read as just plain vintage military inspo, but collectively they shouldn’t have a drill sergeant vibe. In another example of accessories making or breaking it, the sleek black boots and black beret bring it more towards [“when you have brunch at 11 and a coup at 12”](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/46/77/a0/4677a02872161d413f0cf08e6b73ce02.jpg). I tend to favor lace-up boots for this style because it feels more boots-on-the-ground and less shiny officer boots, if that makes any sense. Also sticking to lighter earthy tones can keep things more obviously safari inspired.
* **Professor style:** actual professors now obviously wear a larger variety of styles, but I mean that sort of old school ivy league humanities professor look. [This](https://i.imgur.com/jAQExpc.jpg) is a really fun look, but it’s on the formal/buttoned-up side and doesn’t quite have the outdoorsy vibe. I think incorporating at least one more utilitarian/relaxed fit piece can help bring it more towards an explorer/adventurer look.

# FAQ

Questions no one has actually asked me, since I obviously just posted this, but which I've seen cropping up periodically on FFA.

**Cool, now I can dress like a Tolkien elf / sci-fi villain at my new job at the law firm?**

If part of your job description involves wearing a literal uniform for safety/practicality or looking as close to some conservative industry standard as possible, it's probably in your best interest from a career perspective to stick to reserve your creative outfits for the weekend.

There was one true corporate goth “Dark Goddess of the Cubicle Farm” (sadly since deleted) which actually attempted to be fully business casual compliant, and the top comment was basically ""that just looks like business casual with small goth details?"" That’s the point! There’s a spectrum on how hard you can lean into a style. You can incorporate a small flavor of it, or a lot. Your clothes don’t have to be a 100% reflection of WHO YOU REALLY ARE INSIDE every day. Just have fun with it how you can.

**Do I need to have just one style? Do I need to define my style(s) to Fashion properly?**

No, only if you think it will be fun or that having a more cohesive wardrobe will make getting dressed easier for you. Even if you find it helpful to define your style, it doesn’t have to be like, “Atlantic storm goddess who is trying to pass as a schoolteacher in 1940s NYC”. Something like “I like things that are more minimal and structured for my business casual clothes” or “girly-leaning grunge” can also work.

You could still apply the process I outlined here. I just chose more sartorially weird examples because I think most people have a better sense of how to find items that were inspired by things that are obvious to find in mall stores, but it isn't always obvious how to do that if you're starting with movie costume or couture inspo.

Having a sort of mission statement for your wardrobe that you can come back to when shopping or deciding what you need to get rid of can help keep all your pieces more cohesive, which will make creating intentional-looking outfits easier. If you don’t care about having a cohesive outfit or wardrobe, there is no reason to do this. But many people find having some kind of cohesive look aesthetically pleasing and comforting.

You also don't need just one style! I don't militantly stick to one style, but I still like to come up with capsules within my wardrobe that fit more specific aesthetics. You could also have one main style so that most of your clothes will look fine together that you defined based off an intensely-curated Pinterest board, and then the other 20% is just whatever you thought looked nice. Or maybe 80% of your clothes is just whatever you thought looked nice and could wear to work, but you have a small capsule of going-out clothes with a strong aesthetic. Whatever floats your boat.

**Why does FFA have a childish obsession with shoving their wardrobes into overly specific style buckets?**

Because it's a way that people can have fun with clothes. Let 👏 people 👏 like 👏 things

Seriously though, it's an online forum. You're gonna get the people who are really extra into things.

**But why witches??**

"Guide: Packing for Travel, a.k.a., I'm going to [PLACE] in [MONTH], what should I pack!?","This sub gets a lot of questions about packing for travel, and there is a ton of good advice to be found on the topic. This post is an attempt to gather it all together in one place. 

Since people travel to lots of different places for lots of different reasons, this guide will attempt to give you a **strategy** to employ when packing -- it won't tell you exactly which items to pack. And since this is FFA, not a travel subreddit, these tips are mostly for *clothing choices*, not for the *logistics* of packing (though I did include a small logistics section at the end). With the exception of more long-term travel (months at a time), this strategy should work well for a weekend with friends in New York City, a 10-day African safari, visiting family for the holidays, a romantic getaway in Paris, or a month exploring in India.

Packing is the art of choosing the most (1) **comfortable**, (2) **versatile** pieces in your wardrobe that are appropriate for the (3) **weather** at your destination and the (4) **activities** you'll be doing while there.

Addressing these out of order...


**ANSWER TWO MAIN QUESTIONS TO START**

**1: Weather?**

I always start with the weather: What kind of **shoes** will I need, and what kind of **jacket**, if any? 

You will be miserable if you only pack a denim jacket, and it's freezing your entire trip. You'll be similarly miserable if you only pack canvas shoes, and it rains the entire time. So, to ensure your clothes don't distract you from you enjoying your trip, your first step is to pick shoes and jackets that are appropriate for the weather forecast. 

Note: Although you can (and probably should) spend time before your trip thinking about what you might bring, you should wait until the day or two before you leave to actually pack, because the weather forecast changes all the time -- and it will probably change again once you arrive!

**2: Activities?**

The second most important thing to consider is what activities you'll be doing -- even a general idea is useful. Lots of walking? Sight-seeing in an urban metropolis? Visiting a beach? Anything sporty, like hiking or canoeing? Will you be spending time around animals, or on a farm? Mostly outside, or mostly inside? Clubbing, bar-hopping, or fancy dinners? Any modesty requirements for visits to a mosque, the Vatican, etc.? Any formal occasions to plan for?

Answering these questions will help you further narrow down your shoe and jacket choices. A week in London spent eating at Michelin-star restaurants will require very different shoes and jackets than a week spent traipsing through the jungle in Thailand.

**BUILD UPON YOUR CHOSEN SHOES AND JACKETS**

When it comes to choosing items from your closet to pack, let *color* and *proportion* guide you to the most **versatile** pieces you own that you know you'll be **comfortable** wearing.

**Color:** 

If you have a fairly cohesive color scheme in your wardrobe already, that makes it 10x easier to create a smaller capsule for traveling. Here is a guide to [color matching](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1pbmrj/a_guide_to_color_matching/) and one on [personal color analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2hjrhz/an_introduction_to_personal_color_analysis_aka/). 

* **Easy mode:** Bring all neutrals. Everything goes with everything. The easiest choices are [black, white, gray, and denim](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/79/46/73794629f7802109dc122307c39abf29.jpg).

* **Moderate difficulty:** Add one or two ""pop"" colors to your neutral bases. [A Pair and a Spare](http://apairandasparediy.com/2015/06/how-to-pack-the-5-4-3-2-1-guide/) has a [black/white/denim + army green](http://apairandasparediy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/18510052620_35de9bce57_o.png) example. This blog post from [Live Love Sarah](http://livelovesara.com/2017/02/what-to-wear-in-central-europe-outfit-options/) shows a [black/white/gray/denim + blush pink](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/95/fc/e4/95fce4915b9d6aa4694f50fb88ccfd72.jpg) example.

* **Hard mode:** Forget ""neutrals"" and pack what speaks to you. The Vivienne Files is a fantastic resource for [color capsules of all types](http://www.theviviennefiles.com/p/four-by-four-wardrobes.html).

**Proportion:** 

If color is the ""match"" part of a ""mix-and-match"" travel wardrobe, then proportion and silhouette are the ""mix"" part. Just because navy and mustard are complementary colors doesn't mean you can automatically make outfits with every single navy and mustard piece you have. You have to consider proportion and silhouette to make sure the tops and bottoms you choose interface well with each other. (If you've yet to take the time to identify what proportions you prefer and that work for your body, Into Mind has a great [proportions catalog](https://anuschkarees.com/blog/2013/08/25/proportions-catalogue) to peruse. FFA also has [this guide to proportion](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/).)

Identify one or two silhouettes you want to wear on your trip -- keeping in the mind the shoes and jackets you've already chosen -- and pack items that work well with each other. 

Here are some examples of pairs of silhouettes that contain at least one overlapping element:

* (1) [high-waisted bottoms + cropped-length tops](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/59/8d/2c/598d2c043826bffe5fe94816de4e54ff.jpg) and (2) [fit-and-flare dresses + cropped cardigans](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/312/18488432859_ec11770dce_z.jpg). The cropped cardigans work for both silhouettes: over the dresses, or with the high-waisted pants, maximizing your versatility.

* (1) [maxi skirt + fitted tops](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/38/30/4f/38304f676c4061d61b6699927e760242.jpg) and (2) [loose pants + fitted tops](http://stylishcurves.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4908-2-e1438565592970.jpg). Assuming you coordinate your colors well, all the tops you bring could be worn with all of the bottoms you bring.

* (1) [oversized tops + skinny jeans](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ec/07/b7/ec07b7697ea58b2fd6b74f13877d9f99.jpg) and (2) [mini skirts + oversized pullovers](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/87/e0/7387e0239d5851275f6273b0dd2b98f3.jpg). Again - you can wear the oversized tops with the pants or the skirts, giving you the ability to change up your look and your silhouette with some of the same pieces.

**On comfort:**

Don't try brand-new pieces or new combinations on a trip. If you don't wear it at home, you're unlikely to want to wear it while traveling. And if you don't have experience wearing a piece, you won't know its quirks -- maybe it takes forever to dry, shows water spots, rides up when you walk, wrinkles in a heartbeat, or stinks a lot if you sweat, etc. **Aim to pack things you already wear often.** You know you like them. You know they fit. You know they look good with X shoes or Y jacket. You feel comfortable in them. You feel confident wearing them. These are all important points! You want to enjoy your trip, not spend all of your time feeling uncomfortable in your clothes.

So, based on those four main considerations (weather, activities, versatility, and comfort) you can essentially work yourself through a flow chart of your own closet. Below, I've given two examples of working my way through this strategy when packing for two different types of trips.

**EXAMPLE PACKING EXPERIENCE 1**

4-day trip to visit friends and their new baby in San Francisco in January:

1. What's the weather? Mid-50s F, sunny, no rain forecasted. Great! In that case, I think I'll bring my leather jacket, and I have my choice of shoes since there's no rain. I always walk a lot while I'm in SF, though, so we'll keep comfort in mind. I put insoles in my VANS and find them very comfortable for all-day walking, and since there's no rain the forecast, I should be fine in canvas shoes. I'll probably bring those and my clogs, which are also very comfortable for lots of walking.

2. Since I'm bringing my leather jacket, all of my chunky sweaters are out, because they won't fit under it. So, I'll pick out a couple of thin sweaters and top layers that I know wear well under my leather jacket. 

3. Once I've picked the jacket and a couple of sweaters, I choose some first layers (t-shirts, button-ups, blouses, whatever) that match. I can also start choosing bottoms at this point: for me, it's pants/jeans, because I'm not really a skirt person, especially in cooler temperatures. Remember to keep asking yourself, ""What activities will I be doing?"" I know on this trip, I'll be hanging out at my friends' house with them and their baby, so I don't want to pack fussy fabrics or fancy items like silk or cashmere, because babies can be messy. 

4. At this point, it's useful to start thinking about color. My main neutrals are navy and denim, and most of the other colors in my wardrobe go with those -- and with each other (gray, cream, burgundy, mustard, burnt orange, olive green) -- so it's pretty easy for me to pick some navy/denim bottoms, any combination of tops I like, and go.

5. Now, I consider proportion to make sure the tops and bottoms I chose interface well with each other. Personally, my silhouette of choice is high-waisted bottoms + loose, cropped-length or tucked-in tops. So, I might pack high-waisted dark denim, some tops in cream and gray (mostly fitted that I will wear tucked in since the temperature will be cool), a cropped burnt orange sweater, and a regular navy blue sweater, knowing that I can ""mix and match"" all of it.

**EXAMPLE PACKING EXPERIENCE 2**

8-day trip to Cuba to climb and explore in March: 

1. What's the weather? 80s and 90s F, sunny, but the possibility of rain. So, I'm definitely bringing my Chacos, because those are perfect ""hot + wet"" shoes, especially in a developing country where I won't always be in big cities. I'll probably also bring Birkenstocks for dry days and a slightly more polished look. Jackets? Just my lightweight rain jacket should do.

2. Activities? I'm planning to sightsee and go rock climbing. So, I'm bringing a pair of climbing pants that I can also wear for hiking or horseback riding, etc. Then I add 2 tank tops to climb in, my favorite pair of high-waisted denim shorts, and another tank and tee to wear when I'm not climbing. Two of the four tops I'm bringing are linen, because... hot. The other two are merino wool because they won't start stinking immediately after I sweat in them, and I can wash/dry them quickly if/when they do.

3. It's Cuba and it'll be hot, so I'm bringing a swim suit, because you never know. I'll also pack a casual tank dress that I can wear with the Birks for a nicer dinner look, or as a coverup for any potential beach trips. 

4. Color check: The pants are gray, and the shorts are denim. All of the tops are rusty orange, cream, and gray. The tank dress is navy blue. Looks like I'm good to go! I'll probably also pack my orange and gray flannel for any chilly moments (and the plane). [This is basically my color scheme.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b3/85/12/b3851225ec78f5bc605461f3960e4f7e.jpg)

5. Proportion check: Pants, shorts, and tees are combos I wear often in the summer. As a bonus, I'm bringing one cropped tee, and I can wear it over the tank dress to create a skirt look -- [a la](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/30/00/38/3000387a854a77134c47878bc513028d.jpg) -- if I want.

**FLESH OUT YOUR OUTFITS**

One important step is to actually build outfits with the items you've chosen before you pack them for good. Lay everything out on your bed to see how the colors look together. Try on outfits to make sure you actually can wear that jacket with that dress, or those shoes with those pants, and that it works -- that you like how it looks.

This is also the time to see how many combinations you can make with the items you've chosen. Can you wear most of your tops with all of your bottoms? What about first and second top layers (sweaters/cardigans over tanks/tees) -- are they flexible and interchangeable? Have you chosen any items that can only be worn with *one* other thing? If so, unless it's for a specific occasion, perhaps reconsider bringing it.

**IN SUMMARY**

1. Start by asking yourself what the weather will be, and what kinds of activities you'll be doing. Choose some shoes and jackets based on the answers to those questions.

2. Use your shoe/jacket picks to help you narrow down your clothing choices, always asking yourself if your choices are appropriate for the weather and your activities.

3. Consider color, proportion, and silhouette to ensure you can mix and match most of what you bring.

4. Bring comfortable, trusted pieces that you're familiar with and already wear often.

**OTHER GENERAL TIPS:**

* **Bring your favorites!** If you have that one sweater you find yourself wearing 2x or 3x per week, pack it! With your limited travel wardrobe, you won't mind wearing that sweater a lot because... you already do.

* Yes, you can **repeat** outfits and **re-wear** items several times. No one will notice. No one will care. Carry a stain remover pen to remove small marks.

* **Scarves and jewelry** can add interest, variety, and formality without taking up much space.

* **Scarves**: use them... (1) as a scarf, (2) as a blanket, (3) as a pillow, (4) as a head covering in conservative or religious countries and settings, (5) as a towel (in a pinch), (6) as a make-shift satchel (hobo-style), (7) as a privacy curtain, or (8) as a skirt (if it's big enough).

* I never recommend traveling with **white** pants, skirts, or dresses -- too much can go wrong.

* In general, I like to travel with **unfussy pieces and fabrics**. Things that won't wrinkle easily. Things that are easy to wash. 

* Consider **wool**: It's lightweight, it dries quickly, it doesn't hold smells, and you can confidently re-wear wool items more times than other fabrics. There are several companies that make high-quality merino wool clothing items that are great for traveling: [Smartwool](http://www.smartwool.com/), [Ibex](http://shop.ibex.com/), and [Icebreaker](http://www.icebreaker.com/en/home) are my favorites.

* For a one-off **formal occasion**, a dress or skirt can get you far: ""dress it up"" or ""dress it down"" with a change of your shoes, jewelry, jacket, and/or hair: [a jersey dress](http://www.athoughtfulplaceblog.com/dressed-up-or-dressed-down/), or [a jumpsuit](https://d2klylognp0re.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BLG_boutique_support_tart.jpg), or [a lace skirt](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9pHKQfBGuDE/VRl463g3hRI/AAAAAAAAQ-8/Z1cHQXvU6zE/s1600/lace%2Bskirt%2Bdressed%2Bup%2Bdressed%2Bdown.png).

* If **space** is at a premium, bring old socks and underwear and throw them away before you come home. 

* Don't forget **pajamas** -- if you're staying in someone else's home, a hostel, or anywhere else that's not completely private, you'll want a top &amp; bottom you can wear around other people at night. Leggings or joggers + tee, for example. Bonus if either piece is one you can also wear as part of an outfit if you need to.

* I always bring a pair of **cheap rubber flip flops**, no matter my destination. For shower shoes, for wearing around the house / hotel / hostel, to the beach, to the pool -- you never know how they might come in handy.

* If it's a longer trip, consider if you'll be able to do **laundry**. If you can, maybe you can get away with packing a bit less and wearing a smaller number of items more often. 

* **Warm weather tips:** Maxi skirts, maxi dresses, and joggers are great for full coverage that won't make you overheat. Fabric suggestions include linen (though prone to wrinkles) and [wool](http://www.merino.com/wool/the-fibre/5-ways-to-beat-the-heat/). A [linen or chambray button-down](http://www.bodenimages.com/productimages/productLarge/17WSPR_WA785_LAV_W01.jpg) is a great top layer for summer travel. Wear it alone, over a tee, or [tied over a dress](http://brightontheday.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brighton-4-740x1110.jpg).

* **Cold weather tips:** Layers. Wool. Wool socks. Silk long underwear. Uniqlo [Heattech](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech-collection). Lightweight, [packable down jackets](http://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-down-sweater-jacket/84683.html?dwvar_84683_color=BSRB&amp;cgid=womens-jackets-vests-insulated#tile-2=&amp;prefn1=features&amp;prefv1=packable&amp;start=1&amp;sz=24).

**ON FITTING IN / BLENDING WITH LOCALS / NOT LOOKING LIKE A TOURIST**

Some people feel strongly about fitting in with the local style when they travel. If you want to take the opportunity of traveling to a new place to explore a new style, obviously that's fine, but it's usually not *necessary* to worry too much about it -- unless it's a modesty issue for cultural or religious regions. For example: If you're visiting Muslim countries, mosques, temples, the Vatican, or other religious sites or places of worship, you should be aware of and sensitive to the accepted dress out of respect. On the other hand, if you're visiting Stockholm from the U.S., for example, and are just worried about looking ""too American,"" you can probably relax a bit. Millions of people visit Stockholm every year -- its residents are used to tourists and are unlikely to treat you differently no matter if you're wearing an LLBean fleece and [Asics](http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/4/3/6/3/1/7/webimg/571940554_o.jpg) or the latest in Scandinavian minimalism or street style. Do not act obnoxiously or be disrespectful, and you'll be fine.

**ON THE LOGISTICS OF PACKING (esp. for air travel)**

Traveling with a carry-on instead of checking luggage has become the ""cool"" thing to do recently, and there are good reasons to buy into the practice: 

* Many (most?) airlines now charge extra fees for even a single checked bag, so you can save some money by carrying everything on the plane. 

* You can avoid the possibility of lost or delayed luggage by keeping everything with you. 

* You can adapt to last-minute changes in your travel plans (unexpected layover, forced plane change, rerouting, etc.) without worrying about ending up in a different place than your belongings.

* It's easier to physically manage smaller luggage than large suitcases (and maneuver through crowded spaces, onto escalators and trains).

* From a fashion and outfit-building perspective, bringing a smaller number of clothes makes getting dressed easier and faster because you have fewer decisions to make. That means you spend more time enjoying your trip, and less time in your hotel room, deciding what to wear.

Here are some **general tips for packing and traveling light:**

* It helps if your suitcase itself doesn't weigh very much. Every airline has weight restrictions for carry-on items, so be aware of them.

* It's a universal truth that you will completely fill whatever size bag(s) you choose to bring. Pick a smaller bag, and you'll pack less. Pick a bigger bag, and you'll surely pack more.

* [Roll, don't fold.](http://herpackinglist.com/2013/09/rolling-vs-folding/)

* Experiment with [bundle packing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ZrYtRjYfs). Here's a related [""superpack""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtCH6KLdfBs) strategy for just one overnight.

* Using packing cubes reduces wrinkles and keeps your suitcase from being an explosion of fabric and stuff every time you open it: [Eagle Creek](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packing-cubes/l/212) and [eBags](https://www.amazon.com/eBags-Packing-Cubes-3pc-Set/dp/B004C0XZM4) are two popular brands.

* Tuck socks and underwear inside your shoes to maximize space *and* help your shoes keep their shape.

* Use [re-useable shoe bags](https://www.amazon.com/Richards-Homewares-Travel-Shoe-Bag/dp/B000A68EAW) (or use plastic grocery bags) to keep the dirty soles of your shoes off the rest of your clothes. You can also use plastic shower caps to just cover the soles -- I see that tip a lot, but I'm way more likely to have plastic bags than I am to have 4 or 6 plastic shower caps lying around.

* Here are some [tips for packing toiletries](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/01/packing-tips-toiletry-bag_n_6554404.html).

* Consider the orientation of your luggage most of the time. If you have a traditional [rolling carry-on](http://gogreentravelgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/travelers-choice-hardside-rolling-carryon.jpg), arrange heavy things (shoes, toiletries, appliances) so they'll sit at the bottom (at the wheels) when you close the suitcase and stand it upright. That way, heavy things don't put pressure on your clothing items, potentially wrinkling them. It's also easier to pull and steer a rolling suitcase when heavy things are closest to the wheels. In a backpack, weight is best/easiest carried as close to your back as possible, and not too high. One caveat to this: Some airports still require you to actually remove the bag containing your 3-oz.-or-less liquids when you go through security (LHR, for one). You don't want them to be too difficult to get to if that's the case.

* Wear your bulkiest clothing and shoes on the plane (if it makes sense for the weather).

* Almost everywhere will you go will have almost everything you might need. If space is really at a premium, don't bring things ""just in case"" -- for ex., bug spray, umbrella -- you can always buy them in a pinch.

* If you anticipate coming home with significantly more than you brought, bring a [packable duffle](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packable-duffel/d/1399) that can expand to swallow souvenirs and gifts (make sure to attach a luggage tag with your phone number and email address if you plan to check it).

Whew! This guide got really long, but I hope it was still palatable and useful. I'm very open to feedback and am happy to make edits or additions, so please speak up if you have ideas! 

Also, I know I didn't include anything about **business travel / travel for work**. I don't really have any experience with packing suits and other business-casual or business-formal pieces. If someone wants to type up a section on that, I'll be very happy to add it in with credit to you!

LPT: Staying warm and fashionable this winter (Advice from a Canadian).,"*Last year I posted some advice to /r/LifeProTips that was fairly well received in regards to how to stay warm... But I thought it might be appropriate to follow it up with some ffa oriented advice.*

--------

**Note: I'm going to toe the line between fashionable and practical. This advice will neither be the height of fashion, nor the height of performance. If you want straight survival/performance advice, see my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/).**

--------

First, let's talk a little about **fabric**. And, the secret I'd like to share with you is that **cotton is the enemy**. Jeans, blouses, dress pants, whatever. If it isn't wool or synthetic, it will get wet, stay wet, and provide very little insulation even when dry, and zero protection from the wind. But since it's generally not possible to avoid wearing cotton for 6 mos of the year, layer some synthetic (or smartwool/merino wool) items underneath any cotton item that you wear. So for instance, an outfit like [this](http://cliqueimg.com/cache/posts/img/uploads/current/images/0/46/821/main.original.640x0c.jpg) is fine, but wear some tights/nylons under the jeans and a insultaing undershirt under the cotton blouse. 

Second, let's talk **fit**. An ideal winter outfit will be well-fitting, yet loose enough to allow for unrestricted movement, but needs to create little sealed pockets of air as bubbles of insulation. Anything flowy/baggy/open will not. Anything super tight restricts blood flow and also causes issues.  So how does this apply to you? If you want to wear a [loose blouse](https://cdna.lystit.com/photos/dc34-2014/02/20/mango-white-flowy-shirt-product-1-17790655-2-051651916-normal.jpeg), that's fine, but wear a synthetic/wool long underwear or tanktop underneath and tuck it into your pants. **You're trying to mimic how a thermos works**. So that goes also for a [shawl type coat](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1SfssKpXXXXaiXFXXq6xXFXXXW/Free-Shipping-Hot-Sale-Women-s-Fashion-Wool-Coat-Elegant-Plus-Size-Cape-Shawl-Poncho-Wrap.jpg). Where possible, wear as many layers under, and create sealed pockets of air.  

And all this sorta segues into my point about heat transfer. You lose heat from the air, water, and induction/contact with cold objects. In addition to the clothing you're wearing, you can minimize these issues by:

* Warming up all the little pockets of air in your [not totally practical winter] clothes prior to going outside. That warm air will provide an additional barrier to protect you from the cold outside.
* Protect yourself from the wind. Yes, cover your ears/face/exposed skin with clothing (toque/scarf/mitts), but also stand in whatever shelter available and walk next to buildings to avoid the wind. 
* Stay dry. Getting wet will give you hypothermia/frostbite in minutes vs hours. If you feel yourself starting to sweat, immediately take off a layer... Or two. Whatever it takes. If it's slushy you're usually better off with $20 gumboots and a good pair of socks, rather than non-waterproof boots. 
* Protect yourself from conduction heat loss. If you're in a cold stadium/arena, be sure you have [something insulating to sit on](https://www.amazon.com/Outwolves-foldable-CAMPING-sitting-BACKPACKING/dp/B012JNYLG4). If you're standing outside, stand on a piece of cardboard or carpet ... or even wood, instead of the concrete. 

------

So what does my winter warm look like? Ideally it's a look that allows you to add warmth and remove as needed.

[**Here's a little inspiration album.**](http://imgur.com/a/E3pLs) 

----

Items of note:

* A large crossbody purse that can hold my ""inside shoes"" and any layers that I need to shed and stash when I come indoors.
* Toques, leg warmers or thigh high socks, and touchscreen compatible gloves. 
* [Fleece lined tights](https://www.amazon.com/Berkshire-Womens-Cozy-Tight-Fleece-Lined/dp/B00W50XF46) and a ton of bulky sweaters and sweater dresses. 
* A stupid amount of scarves. My favourite right now is this enormous wool scarf (looks similar to [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a6/78/86/a67886f55ef72bc99456e3377938ea30.jpg)). But blanket scarves are also great... Just make sure that the scarf has some ""warmth"" to it. Some of the more silken fabrics (some pashminas) aren't as great. 
* A reasonably warm, somewhat low budget, [coat](http://www.cartoondollemporium.com/forum/pics/cdeblog/2015/03/green-jackets-1024x1024.jpg) (on the left) from Garage. And while it technically breaks the rules by being cotton, I live in a very dry climate, plus it comes with a heavy quilted synthetic liner and polar fleece down the back of my neck. **But adding more layers is a much better idea than spending ungodly sums on a high-end winter coat that you'll only be able to wear when it's really cold.** 
* [Expensive] High quality waterproof boots. I have two pairs. One is [practical](http://www.sorel.com/womens-joan-of-arctic-boot-1708791.html?cgid=women-boots&amp;dwvar_1708791_variationColor=052#start=5), [one is more fashionable](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/67/84/d5/6784d52bcb7aabedaecb3c2e8acf2544.jpg). If you're gonna make it rain, make it rain on a high quality pair of waterproof winter boots. 

--------

Bonus! Winter safety for women:

* Many (lower) quality shoes tend to have plastic bottoms that become ridiculously slippery when cold. So make sure you take steps [lol] [to improve your traction](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2mpolw/why_do_womens_shoesboots_so_rarely_have_any_grip/). 
* Make sure you tell people where you're going, when you should be arriving, and plan for a way to get home (my town is notorious for cabs disappearing when it's cold, so I always have an emergency back up who I can wake up if necessary). 
* Consider adding a [space blanket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_blanket) to your purse. They're teeny tiny and could save your life. 
* Bring a cell phone charger with you wherever you go.
* Hoods drastically reduce your hearing and peripheral vision. Consider wearing a toque instead (especially at night).",femalefashionadvice,352,1481914519.0,128,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/5ipzpr/lpt_staying_warm_and_fashionable_this_winter/
Europe - A Guide to the lost and confused traveller,"The plane tickets have been bought, your hotel is booked, the date is approaching and you’re looking at an empty suitcase wondering what to pack. You want to wear your comfortable sneakers, but some say “In Europe, no one wears sneakers and everyone looks out of a streetstyle blog.” Is there any truth to that? Can you wear sneakers and not stick out like a sore thumb? This guide will hopefully help clear up a few misconceptions and generalizations about Europe so that packing will be the easiest part of the trip.

**General information**

Europe may not be a big continent *(some may say that it’s part of the eurasian continent, but hey, semantics)*, but it makes up for it in historical, cultural and geographical differences. It consists of around 50 states and luckily something won’t be considered offensive in one and the pinnacle of fashion in other. These will be general guidelines more about the “dos” rather than the “do nots” with a focus at the end on country/city specifics. 

Also, you’ll probably always look like a tourist. It’s okay! Big cities are filled with them, visiting from the neighbouring country or the other side of the world. 

**Weather**

The easiest way to gauge how the weather will be is to search for the average weather at the time of the year you’ll be visiting. Be specific: “Paris average temperatures March” will be much better than “France average temperatures March”. When closer to the time of the departure look at the weather forecasts. I think it’s always better to expect the worst and overpack a little because running around trying to find warm sweaters or a rain poncho is a waste of time. Layers are of course a great plan, things that you can both wear on their own or layered in case of necessity. Also, I have used [this site](http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php) in the past with some success in getting a general picture of the climates I’m travelling to.

**Transportation - planes**

If you’re going to be flying in low cost airlines, read their most recent guidelines very closely and follow them to the letter! Measurements for carry-on baggage differ between carriers and some are stricter than others. If you plan on shopping, try to pack as light as possible so that you have space in your suitcase.

**Transportation - daily life**

Preferably, go for a bag that is always in your sight. Keep it as small as possible and not easy to open. Carry your transportation card(s) in an outside pouch or pocket. It doesn’t need to be an unbreakable fortress, a crossbody with a zipper is more than enough. 

If you’re going to a city where biking is a common means of transportations, plan ahead for that(  “Good type of skirts for biking include: maxi, midi, skater, tulip, anything loose that doesn't ride up.” /u/slugmilkshake).

If you’re concerned about travel safety (especially if you’re going to be travelling alone), I like the Adventurous Kate blog... This is a good list of travel safety tips, really for anyone: http://www.adventurouskate.com/top-10-travel-safety-tips-for-women/ (though her tip about Birkenstocks in Paris is wrong ) (this was added by /u/schauspielerin and it’s great advice).

**Footwear**

Go for comfortable, waterproof or easily dried. Yes, you can wear sneakers. No one will care or target you for wearing them. Choose pairs you know are comfortable and that you’ve had for a while to break in. If you want to be on the safe side in terms of style, go for things like Converse or Vans over the Asics you run in. 

Additionally, according to /u/Miasonna Birkenstocks Arizonas are still seen as a pair of house slippers in places like Austria,. The models that look more sandals are okay.

**Clothing**

Casual clothing is fine. Everyone wears jeans and a lot wear shorts. What can stand out is if you’re looking overly sporty-- out of a North Facecatalog with mountain boots, or are plastered in shirts branded with American universities or the local sports team of your choice. But if you’re actively thinking about how to not look like the Standard American Tourist, you’re already ahead of the game. In some countries, wearing leggings as pants (especially thin ones) is not common and the same goes for flip-flops. 

If you’re going to a city where biking is a common means of transportations, plan ahead for that(  “Good type of skirts for biking include: maxi, midi, skater, tulip, anything loose that doesn't ride up.” /u/slugmilkshake).

**Nightlife**

If you plan on going out, research well what types are available and what interests you. In some southern countries going out is something very casual and done outside, in patios or literally sitting in the streets so there’s no need to pack fancy clothing and heels.

**Country specific advice**

*Portugal* - While the cobblestones are a trademark of the country, they are very slippery when wet. This coupled with the not so flat cities makes shoes with good grippy soles essential. 

*Netherlands* - The Netherlands is absolute balls for heels. Seriously, worst sidewalks ever in the historic city areas. I have fallen so many times because of polished smooth uneven stones, slimey grime coating them, and the ever present thin layer of rain water/dew. as per /u/DeineBlaueAugen

*Northern Europe* -  It can still get cold at night (especially in June). Also, there can be a lot of mosquitoes in the more remote places in Scandinavia, so have something long-sleeved with you. /u/slugmilkshake

*Switzerland/Germany* - In winter it's obviously cold but as long as you're not going into the mountains you won't need snowboot(...). The streets are normally cleared of any snow. Public transport is ubiquitous but you'll do your fair share of walking. (...)Even in summer, it rains on the regular, so bring an umbrella or even better a raincoat. /u/Sparkly_Kitten

Changing your Style and Keeping Calm,"Alternate Title: How To Wear Clothes (But Like, Mentally)

So every week or two I see posts here titled ""How do I wear what I want to wear?"" or ""How do I get over the anxiety of trying on a new (to me) style or outfit?"" or ""How do I pull off \[x trend/things I've never worn before\]?""

But if it were that easy we wouldn't be making this [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/d8zztb/choosing_an_outfit_and_sticking_with_it/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9rw27u/how_do_you_get_up_the_courage_to_change_your/) [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/20seh6/how_do_you_feel_confident_in_certain_clothes/) [it](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cphhep/how_do_i_actually_wear_what_i_want_without_caring/ewpjfh5/?context=3) [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9ta4ob/item_from_your_closet_that_you_like_but_arent/) [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/37mbfc/how_long_did_it_take_you_to_finally_be_confident/) [time](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/63bmxh/girls_who_are_confident_and_happy_with_their/) (btw a lot of good advice across these thread). I'm hoping to create a compendium for reasons why ""just do it"" doesn't feel ""right"" and then responses to that. So if anyone has other feelings that hold them back aside from the ones I've listed, please feel free to add them! Especially if they found a solution for that way of thinking!

Just to make things clear: This is not a guide on ""how to wear something that might not be appropriate for the context I'm wearing it to"". If you work in finance in an incredibly stuffy office with rules, regulations, a mean boss and/or judgy clients, you're going to have to follow the explicit dress code. Sometimes these codes are implicit, and you work in a chill tech bro place where you're expected not to ever wear a tie not once not even a bowtie, or they're implicit in that no one expects to say anything to you in your manufacturing job, but there's a damn good reason everyone's wearing steel toed boots.

**I'm new to fashion and want to wear clothes deliberately, but terrified of doing this for one or many reasons**.

It's possible, when taking on any new endeavor, to be afraid because it feels like you don't have enough 'background knowledge' or knowledge of the 'rules'. You might make 'mistakes'. In this way, I would argue that fashion is similar to art- -I'm not sure there are mistakes. Maybe you'll discover that silver doesn't look good on you, or that you actually hate high socks, but you won't know until you try it on and walk around!

Doing it this way is costly though--some ways to mitigate cost are to really do research before hand\* as to what you might like, to try things on before you by them as much as you can, try to shop from places that have liberal return policies and also try to buy a cheaper version of the new thing before you spend more money on it that you'll have buyer's remorse about.

\*Think about what things you want to change and *why*. Are you trying to look more professional in the workplace? Do you want to dress in a way that expresses a unique part of your identity? Are there a certain set of adjectives you're hoping to project with your clothes (btw I rec [wardrobe architect](https://blog.colettehq.com/wardrobe-architect) for thinking about this)? When you figure out the details of what and why, the how gets easier (I can look more edgy by adding these sorts of fabric/construction details) and then you can feel confident in your choice of clothing to portray what you want and that could lessen the stress of wearing it out (I think).

It's possible that you're not actually 'scared', you're more stressed out by the idea that you'll have to spend more time thinking about what to wear. That's fair! But with all things there's a learning curve, and eventually planning outfits will become easy--or maybe you'll have curated your wardrobe in such a way that you could pull any four things together and it could work: either way the human brain thrives on making things efficient and you'll find that routines and patterns emerge naturally.

**I'm not new to fashion, but I've created this 'visual idea of myself' and I'm scared of changing it up**.

I get this. Change is hard! I'm not sure why people keep calling humans 'soooo adaptable' because change is something I think we're really good at resisting, ignoring and outright denying for the sake of continuing on even if it isn't comfortable to do so. You are working against a biological instinct here and will therefore need to give yourself every advantage against it.

1) After making the purchase or style decision or what have you that you make, say, out loud, ""I will wear this on Wednesday"" or ""I will wear this to Karen's birthday party"". It's hard to break a promise to yourself.

2) If you have friends who are going to something that you want to wear an outfit to, ask them what their outfits are and show them yours! This is an easy way to get feedback on your change and also, honestly, some happy validation from your friends, who will (if they're supportive--if not see below) tell you that you look good and psych you up to wear it. Also, now you can't chicken out.

3) Exposure therapy! Kiiinda. Wear the outfit or thing to a place no one will see you. A place you want to go but no one wants to go with you, for example, is a good one (like an art museum). Feel cool and new and shiny! Use this feeling when you wear the same/similar outfit to a regular errand. Wear it to an appropriate gathering of humans that already know you. Now you've worn it three times. It's a part of your wardrobe!

It will help here, to think about why you want to make the change you're making as well (see the above asterisk). If you can trust that you're making an informed decision, you can trust in your choice.

**Lumen, you don't get it, where I am right now, people** ***will*** **notice if I change, and they** ***will*** **be weird or mean about it.**

Fuck those people. 

But I understand that that's not useful so here's maybe a more nuanced approach.

Rule #1 (for **everyone**): **Do not fiddle. With. Your Clothes.** 

I've noticed that people comment that something doesn't 'suit' someone when that person gives vibes of discomfort with that thing, like constantly adjusting a neckline (I have a friend who was terrified of showing cleavage in one top and did it so often that before I hadn't noticed the top had a large-ish swooping neckline and then after seeing her do it 3 times I kept looking at her hands the next time she did it), constantly pulling things down, fiddling with buttons, folding up and down a shirt sleeve, general fiddling (tbh if you're a chronic fiddler it's possible no one will think this is weird?). 

Fiddle as much as you want at home. In front of your mirror. If you are wearing a button down off the shoulder or something (is this a thing cool people still do? idk) feel free to try it a million different ways, position it in any number of combinations, adjust and readjust as necessary. Feel free to even take pictures of all the looks! But once you're on the street, it's not something you're wearing. It's just a part of what you look like today and you aren't even aware of it--like your nose. It's on your face, but do you look? No! DON'T LOOK AT YOUR NOSE.

Rule #2: Posture matters.

People trying new things and feeling weird about them tend to slouch (more, if they're slouchers/a modern human in this world of needing to look down all the time). This makes clothes look like they don't fit, and makes bodies look...odd. People notice this change, and will associate it to your clothes.

Rule #3: There will always be stressful people.

People don't like change. It's why parents pick fights with kids when they're leaving home for the first (or millionth) time, it's why significant others freak out at unplanned haircuts. Change reminds them that they too need to be changing and also that they don't actually *know* you. Even if you're doing a small thing, someone might say something to bring you down or back to 'normal' because they're scared. Don't take on someone else's fear, everyone does things at their own pace and they'll get used to this new you eventually.

**Shit, Lumen, I might have a deeper problem than this**.

You're not alone! If you feel like you don't look good in the mirror in a really frequent way, if you're worried about a flaw you think you might have and feel like you have to focus your entire life and closet around it, if feelings of distress about your body (in or out of clothes) are getting in the way of your social or professional (or any adjective here) life, I think you should try talking to people (ideally a therapist!) about it. This is not an issue I'll be able to help with as a rando voice on the internet or as someone saying ""Guuuuurl just do it!!"" this is something that might take longer to unlearn, but you can unlearn it!

Hell, even if you think things about changing styles that are mean to yourself--y'know the ""I can't ever pull this off because I'm too x"" or ""this is for y people and I'm a k person"" or ""I'm not adjective enough to wear this"", you're being too mean to yourself. Everyone can try everything--the internet will ascribe different styles to different bodies, but we see those fake rules broken all the time and we love it.

Also, body dysmorphia is labeled this one ""THING"" that you either have or don't have, but I can't imagine living as a woman in the world and not existing on a spectrum of having ""unhealthy thoughts about your body looking a certain way""--I feel most of the time as though I've worked through my issues with regard to this, but then circumstances change or I hear something from someone or read something on the internet and find that I haven't perfectly gotten over *all* of it. I think someone reading this might say ""okay I think I can't pull this off, but I don't have Body Dysmorphia omg Lumen stop being overdramatic and patronizing etc etc.""--which fine, you can totes have these feelings while having a largely healthy body image thing going on--but it still isn't true that you can't pull something off and also someone else who does have BDD might express their anxieties using the same exact language, I can't tell who's generally okay but commenting on societal expectations of body, and who's really stressed or sad through the internet.

When this sort of disordered pattern of thinking is something you're grappling with ""just do it!"" might sometimes work, but it also might not. Please, DO NOT beat yourself up over not being ""confident"" enough or ""liking yourself well enough"" to wear the whatever it is that is giving you trouble! All change takes time, and changing your thoughts require more time than just changing a tee shirt. As always, I'm a big advocate for therapy. It's great. In an ideal world everyone has access to mental and physical health experts at all times, but if that's not a thing you can do there are people online who can help, and even apps made by therapists that try to make things more accessible for people! Also talk therapy isn't the only kind of therapy, remembering to spend time with friends and taking care of yourself (eating well but also happily, doing fun things with your body, looking at trees) are all important!

**Fashion is supposed to be fun, friendos**. **Let's** **have a fun time.** 

Also, as I said above, if anyone is interested in chiming in with tactics that work for them, that'd be great! This is *not* at all a comprehensive list, but idk--I thought it might be useful.",femalefashionadvice,509,1570738663.0,28,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/dg3vgn/changing_your_style_and_keeping_calm/
2018 Low Buy Year Summary,"Hi Ladies! 

I was inspired to post this by the post yesterday with everyone's goals of no/low buys for the year. This is pretty difficult for a lot of us without a plan. Its good to set intentions, but I kind of made a action plan to do it, and I kept notes of my progress. This is an honest accounting of how I did for the year 2018. 

I started this personal plan Last year when there was a lot of discussion on here about [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/opinion/sunday/shopping-consumerism.html) NYT article about a year of No-Buying. I was inspired by it but wasn't going to commit to a No-Buy year. I decided to make my own rules and see how I stuck with it for the year.

I ended up being laid off in January- so while I have plenty to live off of- I knew I had to change my buying habits a lot as I want to start a business and also live more sustainably without chasing luxury items and endless consumption of new- things.  My lifestyle doesn't require it, and honestly- I know I have a bad ass wardrobe and I love styling and dressing pretty eclectically/ distinctively.

Some notes- I am 41, American/ but have lived abroad for the last 7 years (Paris/ 3years, and now South Africa for almost 4 years.) I have been a maximalist for a while- and my lifestyle &amp; environments &amp; work needs have changed considerably over the years- I have quite a collection of everything from vintage (used to be a dealer)- to high end ""luxury"" brands. I have also bought used/resale/vintage for over 20 years, so while I still lover certain brands or designers- I rarely buy fast fashion, full price or even brand new. I am super happy when I travel to create tightly edited monochromatic capsules (and I travel a lot!) but I love having so many options at home. 

**Here was my ""Plan"" for 2018 and How I Did**

**1. I started off making a wish list of items for the year-** this included white whale/long term wish list items (i.e. Red Chloe Susannas) , foreseeable replacements (i.e. ""black chucks"") and an allotment of ""wild cards"" (I think I started with 5 for the year)- where I could buy something on impulse.  I could edit this list if something no longer appealed to me or was just- not a priority anymore. (i.e. ""Red Purse""). Overall I think there were like 10 wishlist/foreseeable replacements and 5 wild cards. I added/ edited this list as a draft in my Inbox as an easy way to make notes of things I bought.

**2. I made rules for the year of things I was absolutely NOT allowed to buy.**   
\- anything with stripes (confession: bought one striped tank)  
\- black or white or cream silk shirts (I have way more than my lifestyle warrants)  
\-Socks (Confession: bought one pair of socks in a tourist emergency)  
\-bras (Goal Achieved!)

**3. I made additional rules for ""trade-outs""**  
\- to buy 1 new tshirt = have to get rid of 3 (kind of followed this)

\- to buy 1 new shoe- have to get rid of 2  (pretty much followed this!)

**4. Made a priority of selling/ decluttering.** Sold quite a bit to TRR (which included hauling a MASSIVE suitcase of goods to the US on my annual visit) and selling locally at a high end resale shop. Also gave away a ton of of ""skinnier"" clothes to a good friend who has my old size/ and style) Still have bags of giveaways in my garage.

All this being said- I didn't stick to my list  OR rules. I bought a lot more than I planned- BUT still considerably less than in any year past. 

**5. Here is how I did.** 

Total Sold (cash) $650  
Total Remaining Store Credit (all on TRR) $1400  
Total Spent in Store Credits: $420  
Total Spent in Cash: $2295  
Not tracked but probably embarrassingly high amount: Shipping Costs to South Africa &amp; Duties 

Targeted # of Purchases for the year: 15  
Total Amount of Clothing Items Bought: 30  
\# Articles Used: 12  
\# Articles New: 18 (though sometimes I have bought things on TRR that are technically ""New"" but on a resale site - whatever, ""new-ish)

**Itemized List:**  
Dresses: 3  
Tops (incl jackets, sweaters, tees etc): 10  
Bottoms: 4  
Shoes: 6 (including one pair that was a gift)  
Accessories: 6 (2 waist bags, 1 purse, 3 pairs of sunglasses -but I lost one pair)

**6. Overall Summary of 2018**

I don't feel terribly bad about the amount of number of items I bought this year. It was more than I intended, but It's been eye opening to keep track for the first time! I think I did really well by doing some purging and making money off of the purges. I sold things I had impulse bought in the year before during some really dark times. I gave away a lot too. 

The things I bought I actually DO wear and most were planned choices (i.e. I wanted a pair of black camo trousers and searched high and low and got the most amazing pair- wearing them right now!)

Sometimes shit happens! I was on holiday and I brought the WORST pair of sneakers for the trip- so my feet were so miserable I had to stop and buy some new walking shoes. My list for the year I had listed new Chucks (my black and white ones were either destroyed or are looking pretty haggard.) I ended up buying Red Chuck Hightops instead. They were fun and I love them and my feet were so happy. Unplanned purchase but so needed! Note to self: don't bring 1/2 size too small vans slip ons to walk all over cobblestone streets in Europe. NO GOOD. 

I feel like I learned a lot about myself this year through a life coaching course I took, and a lot of critical analysis of my lifestyle and actual personal goals. I have stopped buying for the lifestyle I WANT and I am now buying less or not at all for the low key lifestyle I HAVE.  I KNOW I can do even MORE this coming year (see 2019 goals below).

Overall I am proud that I kept track and was accountable to myself for my consumption and spending. I got great deals on some things that I truly love (my MVP has been a Old Stock NWT gold leather vintage Bottega Veneta purse for $185! I wear it all the time!)  and have enhanced my wardrobe. I truly like being awake and conscious about my consumption instead of being ashamed of it, hiding my purchases, excessive, and always WANTING new things (instead of appreciating what I have) and also ignoring the costs and volume of new things entering into my life. 

It may look like I did not stick to my goals this year and it was a failure. But I only see progress and achievement. 

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Fashion/Shopping Goals for 2019**

\- No more mail order from abroad. The shipping and duties are crazy and the wait time is aggravating and I have burned myself SO\_MANY\_TIMES (2017 I'm looking at YOU!) by not loving the things or they are not fitting right and not being able to return from abroad. Waste of Money!

\- That being said- I have a $1400 in Store credit to TRR which I would like to utilize as MOST of my shopping budget for the year, but I don't want to ship internationally. So I will use the Store Credit when I LOVE something and can send to a relatives house or a friend traveling to see me or just wait to get it until I travel back to the US. No instant gratification. Is what it is. 

\- Buy more local/indie products in South Africa if I fall in LOVE with something. I am moving away this year and want a few more things from some local designers  
\- MEND, Tailor, and RENEW pieces of clothing I already own. One of my favorite t-shirts I have right now used to be a pale pink linen Isabel Marant Etoile t-shirt. I NEVER wore it until I over-dyed it a dark slate grey. Now I wear it all the time. I have lots of things that I don't wear because the hem is half falling out, I don't love the length or some other minor thing that keeps me from wearing it. I have a new tailor, some skills of my own and my creativity. I can refresh my wardrobe by fixing the things I have.

\- Say goodbye to my closet/collection of heels/wedges. I have SO MANY and I wear them so rarely. I love them like children and there are some beautiful gems.. And they take up so much space. But they just don't fit my lifestyle anymore and they haven't for a long time. I want to curate and sell what I can. Reduce by half??  
\- Take part of styling challenges and enjoy my closet. I started this already this year and it is really fucking fun. I like my clothes, my weight is relatively stable, I have been learning to appreciate my body how it is (and not waiting to wear something because ""it would look better if i lost 5-10 pounds""- Now I am wearing it anyway, I have clothes that are fun to style and tons of great accessories. It's Time to appreciate what I have accumulated, enjoy it as a hobby without the need to get more more and more.

\- I want to Learn to use my cameras better and take photos of my outfits. I am not comfortable with sharing photos very often, and I would like to share my creativity more. Is this lame? 

\- Set a target number of shopping items and wildcards this year and \_Stick to it\_. Continue tracking spending. Write down any wish list items and revisit to see if I still even want it. I think I am going to shoot for 15 again.   


\-Get a clothes steamer. I have wanted one forever since I worked in retail a zillion years ago. It's legit The fastest and easiest way to look amazing when you get dressed.   
\- Erase shopping apps off my phone (TRR and Ebay are my weaknesses, but honestly the TRR website sucks so much in comparison to the app !) I want to stop wasting my time by scrolling through saved searches and feeds to shop for things that are far away, that would require spending money I don't need to spend and wanting things that are always VERY similar or variations on things I already own. It's a double edged sword with that Store Credit sitting around tho. 

  
If you read all of this - Thanks for that! I hope this helps you put your goals in action for 2019 by making your own rules for yourself and then tracking it. I love this forum because everyone is so supportive. Y'all encouraged me this whole last year, and now I am going to make more improvements this year. Good luck on your goals everyone!

A Summertime Eurotrip Mini Capsule Review,"I always love reading about your capsule wardrobes, especially for travel, so I decided I’d give it a try. I just got back (well, like 2 weeks ago) from 11 days in Europe and am overall pretty pleased with my packing efforts, save for a few changes I will make next time as discussed below. This was the first time I actually put a little bit of effort into packing instead of my usual frantic ‘throw shit in a bag and hope for the best’ strategy. 

**The plan:**
My boyfriend and I had a wedding to attend near Milan so we decided to turn it into a full week’s European holiday. We flew into Zürich to explore for 2 days. Flights there were cheaper than to Milan and neither of us had been before so we decided to have a little pre-wedding adventure. We then took a bus to Milan and drove out to Lake Garda for the wedding weekend. From Milan we flew to Valencia, met up with his parents and stayed there one night before driving to Barcelona. We spent 3 days in Barcelona and then finally we all flew to London for our last 2 days. I needed to pack a combination of city wear, beach wear, and wedding attire, though packing for the warm weather made it a little bit easier. My wardrobe is already pretty neutral so it was pretty easy to pick things that match, but I went for blacks, whites, denim and pastel pink/purple.

**What I brought:**

Tops:
- white tee
- black tee
- lavender tee
- Navy tee
- long sleeve striped pink/white linen button up
- white short sleeve button up 
- Black linen tank top
- Black polka dot spaghetti strap top
- White spaghetti strap top
- Lavender sweatshirt
- Grey workout tank top 

Bottoms:
- straight leg jeans
- Jean shorts
- black skirt
- Black running shorts

Dresses:
- floral dress (for wedding)
- black poplin midi dress

Shoes:
- Maroon running shoes
- Black cross strap sandals
- Black mules
- Tan flip flops
- white sneakers 
- black heels (for wedding)

Swimsuits:
- Black one piece
- Paisley one piece 
- Black two piece

Underthings:
- Black bra
- Nude bra
- Sports bra (high support)
- Sports bra (low support, mostly for sleeping)

Bags:
- Rolling carryon suitcase- all clothing and toiletries 
- Small green backpack- camera, book, journal, headphones, misc. plane activities and supplies 
- Black bum bag- passport, phone, wallet 
- Small black shoulder bag- packed in suitcase ( for wedding)
- Tote bag- packed in suitcase 

[All Outfits](https://imgur.com/a/nn7BiJ3): (I also posted these to the  WAYWT a couple weeks ago)

[Day 1](https://imgur.com/a/rGJ3FxG): landed early morning in Zurich and spent the day exploring the city, swimming at the seebad and a ton of walking around. I wore the black bikini underneath for easy swim-to-street transitions. The skirt was awesome for throwing on over a damp bathing suit because it let me air dry without walking around either half naked or with a wet butt.

[Day 2](https://imgur.com/a/yXXsLT6): another big day of walking and exploring Zurich, much hotter today. We swam in the lake again and I again struggled with the dilemma of either walking around half naked or with a wet butt- I opted for the wet butt and was not happy. Should have worn the skirt again (or planned my day better)

[Day 3](https://imgur.com/a/3Ml17Ul): mostly a travel day. We took the bus from Zurich to Milan (which was, by the way, a beautiful ride) and I opted for jeans for sitting on a kind of gross bus for 4 hours. Once in Milan we had to find the car rental and drive about 2 hours further to Lake Garda. My [2nd outfit](https://imgur.com/a/6hh7aAu) for drinks with the bride and groom to-be. I was worried about being too dressy but it was actually perfect. 

[Day 4](https://imgur.com/a/t8KyqWD): wedding day! We had the whole morning to explore Lake Garda. I was worried about further sunburn on my arms after two brutal days of me not putting enough sunscreen on in Zurich, so I went for my long sleeve linen top, which also doubled as a good coverup after swimming because it’s a bit oversized and covers my butt so I don’t feel super weird walking around in just that and a bathing suit. And later, my [wedding festivities outfit](https://imgur.com/a/gMCJXK8). I usually love this dress because I don’t have to wear a special bra with it, but it was so hot that day and I regretted wearing a dress that was so form fitting. 

[Day 5](https://imgur.com/a/nAwuNYZ): for a quick flight from Milan to Valencia and a full day exploring the city of Valencia. I didn’t swim that day, but the skirt was fantastic for keeping cool. 

[Day 6](https://imgur.com/a/yN2L6mL): mostly traveling via car from Valencia to Barcelona. We stopped along the way at a few little towns to swim in the sea, but since we were in the car I could just change in and out of my swim suit. I wore my black one piece that day. 

[Day 7](https://imgur.com/a/CYiklQW): Barcelona, full day in the city. My feet were feeling a bit sore so I decided to wear my running shoes. I wish they were plain black or grey, but I don’t mind how they look with the black skirt and plain tee. I think the sporty bum bag further helps give this outfit a more athleisure-y look. 

Day 8: Barcelona and I don’t have a photo but I wore the denim shorts, linen black tank top and the black strap sandals with my bum bag. We did a lot of walking again but these sandals are super comfy so it wasn’t too bad! Today was probably the hottest day so I’m glad I went sleeveless. 

[Day 9](https://imgur.com/a/IeFgij4): Barcelona and a flight to London. I threw my sweatshirt on for airport/airplane times. 

[Day 10](https://imgur.com/a/3VIEU8h): London. Probably my favorite holiday outfit. I love all black and I think the silhouette is very clean and smart. It was a little chilly in the morning so I threw my sweatshirt on.

[Day 11](https://imgur.com/a/qGbu5Zi): London, a bit chillier and we met up with some friends for brunch so I tried to look a little more put together. I really love this top, even though linen isn’t really easy to travel with, because it’s so light and I can wear it as a top or a beach coverup. [Final outfit](https://imgur.com/a/hcmNR3i)for the flight home, swapped out the button up for a tee and sweatshirt and put on my white sneakers. 
 
**Thoughts**
My uniform for the trip was primarily denim shorts or the black skirt with a cotton tee. I wore the long sleeve button up shirt twice, and didn’t wear the short sleeve button up at all, which is unusual because that’s usually my go-to for the beach. I’d probably pack them both again though. I got some use out of the linen tank and the black polka dot tank, though next time I’d probably only bring one since they’re both black. Probably the linen tank because it’s more breathable. I didn’t wear the white tank top, I think mostly because it was stuffed in the bottom of my bag and I’d forgotten about it.. so I’d leave that out next time too.

the MVP of the trip was definitely the black skirt. In 32 degree C heat it was SO much better than shorts. I’ve never been a skirt person but I’d definitely consider getting it in another color, especially since I plan to wear it with tights in the cooler weather too. I was debating bringing a second, midi-length skirt too, which I would definitely throw in next time. I’m 100% team skirt now. A close runner up for MVP was the bum bag- I bought it at a secondhand shop kind of just for a laugh and my boyfriend mocks me endlessly about it but it is actually SO USEFUL especially for traveling. I love having my phone, wallet and passport in an easily accessible spot that isn’t my pockets. I also used it as my everyday bag for walking around the city. I’m glad they’re making a comeback because it’s been super practical and useful. I had packed a little canvas tote bag for my everyday stuff (which is what i usually use to run errands and stuff at home), but didn’t use it at all. I much prefer having my valuable things attached to my body so there is no opportunity for me to accidentally leave it somewhere or have it swiped. 

I was hoping to wear the black dress more than once, but it was so hot I didn’t reach for it after I wore it initially for the pre wedding drinks. We had a big brunch with some friends planned and i was going to wear it then but it ended up not happening. Still, I think it’s always good to have one versatile dress just in case.

I didn’t wear the jeans except for travel days and my last day in London, which again was just because of the heat. I’d probably bring a pair of joggers instead next time for traveling, although if it were a couple degrees cooler I’d be wearing the jeans more often. I think I’d actually be scared to go anywhere without a pair of jeans!

I think I really only needed 2 bathing suits- I think next time I’ll just bring one bikini and one one piece.

I didn’t wear the mules at all. I think the black cross strap sandals were enough for my “nicer” casual shoe. I suppose if I had more plans to meet up with friends or nice dinners or something I’d consider bringing them again, but for this kind of trip I definitely didn’t need em. 

I made a critical error with my flip flops- everyone told me that the Rainbows are tough to break in and the first few weeks would be a blister-fest. I had just gotten them and reaaaalllly wanted to wear them and didn’t listen so naturally after an hour had managed to destroy both of my feet. So I didn’t wear them for the remainder of the trip, though I’d bring them again once (if ever) they’re more broken in. 
  
I’d love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions for improvement!",femalefashionadvice,80,1565031223.0,30,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cmf5y2/a_summertime_eurotrip_mini_capsule_review/
[FIRST POST] I took pictures of my outfits for a month and now I'm looking for CC,"Last month I challenged myself to take a picture every day of my outfits to get an idea of how I dress and to effectively get CCW. I missed a few days, and a few days are marred by having to wear work shoes, but I got a good sampling of my style and how I tend to throw things together. I ended up buying a lot of new clothes in the process, so I'm currently on a no-buy until I move some stuff through Poshmark and donate the rest.

Very sorry for subpar photo quality (I live alone and am usually in a rush in the mornings when I do this, hence the mirror selfies), but criticism is still super-welcomed. I got some super helpful advice yesterday in the WAYWT thread, but some users mentioned that this might merit its own thread. Try to be gentle!

[Album of ~30 days of outfits](http://imgur.com/a/hGU5W#0)

About Me:

* **Height**: 5'3""
* **Age:** 25
* **Measurements:** 35"" x 25.75"" x 36"" (bust, waist, hips)
* **Body Type:** Pretty solidly hourglass, albeit a petite one
* **Why?:** I want to look more put together, dress my shape well, and look really well-styled. I'm not trendy, so I'm drawn to classic looks but because of that I want to avoid preppy, boring, sorority-girl, matchy-matchy and so on. Classic but with a bit of an edge. Ladylike but not Modcloth ""quirky."" To give you an idea of my personal style safe zone, see [this pinboard](http://pinterest.com/paonecarlate/my-style/). I really love Audrey Hepburn (not just Holly Golightly), but my go-to street style fav on any given day is Alexa Chung. Charlotte Gainsbourg, her mom Jane Birkin and Brigitte Bardot are also inspiring (though I have a semi-shameful soft spot for Lauren Conrad, too). Brands I love are Kate Spade, Rebecca Minkoff, and Dior though I've only invested a little in them so far.  And for an idea of my discomfort zone, i.e. things I'm drawn to but afraid to try, see [this board](http://pinterest.com/paonecarlate/%E3%81%A0%E3%81%91%E3%81%A9-i-wanna-get-a-new-look/). **If I could boil down into a few words what I'm shooting for, they'd be: gamine, Parisienne, clean, classic, stylish.**
* **You Now:** My current style waffles between boring and sloppy. I want to look classic, but I come off ""safe,"" or I want to try something new but I just get it wrong and look messy. Things I tend to wear a lot are Gap, Madewell and Uniqlo. Before that I was all H&amp;M, F21 and *delias, so my style is evolving. I'm at a point where I'm okay investing more in my clothes. I am girly and don't dislike skirts, high heels or pretty much any article of clothing, but I tend not to wear dresses and skirts to work since most people are super casual in jeans (most people where graphic tees and jeans -- my boss wears crocs every day!). I am not into the hyper-trendy, though, like black &amp; white prison bars I've been seeing on everyone lately for example. This is mainly because I don't know how to style such trends. I want to invest in clothes that I'll wear again and again and feel comfortable in. My job is jeans-friendly so I don't have to dress business casual, but I usually try to dress up a little because I enjoy it.
* **Budget:** Low to mid-range. The highest I'm willing to go for a single article of clothing is maybe $40-$80, for a dress or something more intricate I'll happily invest $100-$300. Pretty much my limit for any one item is $300 at the moment, and usually that's a purse. I rarely splurge on one item, tending to invest a little bit in a few items in the middle range or going on a shopping binge for trends to try at at a low-end retailer like H&amp;M or F21. At the moment I'm trying to edit my warddrobe way down and only go for the essentials.
* **Location:** US, LA (Los Angeles, not Louisiana)! Good weather year-round means my outfits are very flexible and I have lots of access to major retailers. The only thing I don't really need is a lot of outerwear. However, I do travel for work a fair amount and do need clothes for that occasionally, too.

Happy to answer any more questions or post more pictures if needed, but I'm pretty verbose, so hopefully that covers it!

ETA: Guys, thank you so much!!! You're all wonderful and very, very helpful. A few things:

1. The hideous (but comfortable) American Eagle booties are officially retired. They'll be replaced by an ankle boot with a slimmer fit up top. It's clear the look I thought I was doing with those is not coming off as intended or working.
2. Sorry about the ugly sneakers in a couple of the outfits. I work about 5-6 work events a year so I'm torn on whether or not to even bother with dressing up for those things.
3. Oh my god FIT!! I had no idea that the fit of my clothes was even a problem, but it seems SO obvious to me now. I'll study up on fit and look into getting some of these things tailored. What can't be tailored will be replaced by similar pieces from a petite line.
4. Jeans! Ugh. I'll keep looking for better fitting jeans that don't sag in the knee.

"How to still dress in ""my style"" without making my husband look like a pedophile","While joking, I'm also completely serious. I look about 6-10+ years younger than I actually am, which I know will hopefully be great when I'm in my 40s &amp; 50s (like my mother who has been mistaken as a 20-something sister on multiple occasions), but right now it sucks. My poor husband gets dirty looks as we're walking down the street holding hands because I don't look like I'm in my 20s like him, but in my teens and I feel like my fashion style isn't helping.

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place/time to post, I've been a lurker here for a while since I've always been interested in fashion, but I couldn't determine a specific thread that would be appropriate. I'd post a picture to show you guys, but I don't really want my face out there (I've managed to avoid FB, twitter, instagram and such) and I'd link you to my fashion style mood board, but it's set on secret. 

While I love [classics](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/80/89/71/808971eae1587f4f36f5fad2e45a6ec7.jpg), [minimalistic black + white basics](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ae/d7/22/aed722b4765836963d15dc67a4f9e9d3.jpg), and [simple, clean lines](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/24/8b/42/248b42c900a4bfba5ac09564b628ed33.jpg), I'm also really drawn to super girly, flirty styles/pieces like [tulle skirts](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/e8/64/03/e864036f9b004ee2533776e55b40d4ce.jpg), [bows anywhere](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/3b/2d/d2/3b2dd205432b4d25adc0cd4cd0f86cd5.jpg) and [everywhere](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/59/b6/e8/59b6e8e1d0b38244cf0110681c394a1c.jpg) and [more](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/41/ab/21/41ab21481704903eba07b05e5e07406b.jpg), [polka dots](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/24/57/22/245722bd380ebb41ff69296df9c32770.jpg), [little floral dresses](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/af/e1/f4/afe1f4fa4f88fa4aab9bd856bcbb5ea5.jpg), [peter pan collars](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/aa/21/84/aa21842bde33ce267fa81e178d166bcb.jpg), [full, bouncy skirts](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/76/f0/88/76f08803482e353937841543c2a6187a.jpg) and the like.

"Hi /r/FFA, I really need your help for a very rare and very special date night","
I met my wife when I was fifteen, way back in 1991.  We married in 1993, and we've had a rollercoaster life since then with fantastic highs and crushing disappointments; she's stood by me through many difficult circumstances, and staggers me with the depth of her devotion to me and our family.  We have four wonderful children.  I work away from home midweek, every week, and she's effectively a single parent in that time.  You can't imagine how much I love her and appreciate her, and I know it takes more than just big romantic gestures to keep a marriage strong - but after a huge amount of logistical planning, I'm making that kind of gesture :-) We'll be having out first night away alone together in about fifteen years next month.  She hasn't got a clue, and it needs to stay that way because - although all the logistics are taken care of - she's a worrier, and if she finds out before it's a *fait accompli*, then it'll all come to nothing.   

So, what's all this to you, other than a nice story?  Well, part of this special night involves a stay in a 5-star hotel and an evening mostly in the open air.  She'll need three outfits as I see it, and I don't think she has anything remotely suitable for any of them: firstly, something to wear to travel in (2 hour train journey, first class) and arrive comfortably at the hotel without feeling underdressed.  Secondly, something drop-dead gorgeous to wear to dinner, followed by a short walk to an open-air event that lasts about two hours - this is ~~Spar~~ London, so we need to be prepared for it being a bit chilly (I thought perhaps some sort of shawl to wear over the dress? But maybe a coat? She needs shoes as well for this outfit).  Finally, she needs something to wear the next day for the journey home, leaving the hotel again without feeling under or over dressed.  I'm looking for some kind of pretense or excuse for her to choose these, but I don't want her to cotton on and force the truth out of me - we're not good at keeping secrets from each other - so if I can just present these outfits to her at the reveal and the inevitable ""but what will I wear?!?!"" question, that might be best.  I know it's a bit of a risk though.

So... she is 5' 9"", about 140lbs, 38 years old.  Body shape sites give either hourglass or straight results from my estimates of her current measurements - the only one I know for sure is bra size recently measured at 36F, and UK Size 14 for clothes, sometimes 12's fit.  I can spend up to about £350 on these outfits.  It would upset her if I posted a picture so I can't do that I'm afraid.  She has long brown hair, greying.  Her usual clothes are practical rather than dressy, as a busy mum-of-four - jeans and jumpers usually - but she often wears a dress to church so she won't feel totally out of place in one.  She never usually wears make-up; but her smile lights up the room.

I'd really appreciate any advice about these outfits because I want everything to be perfect for her; can you help, /r/FFA?

I'm a style train wreck. Help me replenish my closet and start over!,"Hi FFA! I'm in a terrible clothing and style rut and have been doing my darnedest to get out of it to no avail. I'm hoping you guys can help, hopefully you're up for a challenge! 

Prepare for wall of text.

Here it goes:

I started a new job and am going to need clothing that can work for both work and school since I'll be going to work right after class a lot of the time. The dress code at work is ""business casual"" but most people wear whatever they want (jeans are fine). I like to look polished but not too dressed up because comfort is important too. Seems simple enough, right? Wrong. I can't find clothing that fits! Not even shoes! 
I'm down to one pair of jeans that are too big that I've been making work out of desperation, a few boring tops, and several black jersey knit dresses. I have like 4 pairs of shoes and they are about to wear out from being worn so much (I walk a lot)  


I have no style at this point--my ""style"" has become a matter of ""whatever fits today"" and I hate it. I've been shopping almost every day for the past month and have tried on so much stuff with hardly any luck.  An H&amp;M size 2 typically fits me but I really have trouble picking out wearable pieces from there and their jeans don't come anywhere near fitting.


On top of my sizing issues, I have to cover my arms and legs (tights are fine) because I have a skin condition that I like to keep covered, and the office is very cold. I also am really frustrated that a lot of styles out right now are sheer because I don't know how to wear them modestly. Another preference: in terms of shoes, I do not want to wear anything open toed or anything that shows a lot of my foot. 


I desperately need help figuring out what my personal style is AND getting some basic pieces (at the very least). 




I've determined that I REALLY need the following: 



-Jeans. I prefer skinny jeans but not jegging type jeans in a dark or medium wash. I have a big butt/hips for my waist size and short legs so that's always a challenge.

-White cardigan/assorted cardigans.

-Jackets and blazers galore.

-Shoes--nude heels? Flats? Pretty much any shoes that will fit.
 
-Classy dresses and quality tights.






Here are my measurements: 

I'm an hourglass according to the calculator, but some days I think I wear things that make me look more pear shaped...I'd like to avoid that and show off my best assets, my butt and waist.


Waist: 21""

Hips: 30""

Bust: 30""--though I wear a push up most of the time to help make things fit better. With a push up my bust measurement is about  33"" or 34""

Under Bust: 26""

Inseam: about 26"" (short legs)

Height: 5'2 

Shoes- 5.5 or smaller. 







Where can I shop (NOT H&amp;M and preferably not online since its so difficult to find stuff that fits I don't want to be returning stuff all the time)?
What styles can I wear? 
Could you guys point me in the right direction or am I S.O.L?


Oh and I'm in the SF Bay Area if that helps. ",femalefashionadvice,3,1376247085.0,5,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1k5nzy/im_a_style_train_wreck_help_me_replenish_my/
