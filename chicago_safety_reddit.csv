Why do people say the city is more dangerous than it is?,"Before I start, I'm not trying to be confrontational or dismissive. I'm genuinely confused at how people seem to overstate crime in many parts of the city. I feel like I'm missing perspective. Maybe a bit lucky. If any of this contradicts your experiences, I'm all ears.

I am not from Chicago originally, but I have lived here for over a year now. Multiple neighborhoods up and down the city. More specifically: Pilsen, Roseland, Rogers Park, Albany Park, Logan Square\*, and Belmont-Cragin, in that order. I also have worked around Norwood Park, Clearing, and Ukrainian Village. Suffice to say, I have a good feeling for what at least 90% of the city is like. Not one time did I walk the street fearing for my life. I never witnessed anything scarier than a drug deal or a loud argument (between people who already knew each other). The only time I heard gunshots was during the 4th of July when people were using them instead of fireworks. In fact, a lot of the time I walked at night, it was just me. By the way people online and offline talk, you'll think there's always a monster around the corner.

I'm not saying there isn't poverty in the city or crime is completely absent. I spent most of the last year effectively homeless and was victimized by a few white-collar scams\*\*. I also am aware of many parts of the city being working class or outright poor. The thing is, ""Chicago is scary"" isn't something exclusive to online suburbanites. The only difference is Chicagoans will get more granular and specify different neighborhoods.  Okay, fine so far, but who in the right mind is fearing Uptown? Where are the shootings going on in McKinley Park? Did anybody get mugged in Hermosa? I'm being completely serious here. Even the Loop seems to be portrayed as scary after dark. That last one in particular I can say is bullshit and a relic of how cities were in the 70s-80s.  
  
I personally have had to deal with violent, scary people, but only *once* it was somebody I didn't already know. It's of course my own personal experience, as I said I'm not here to dismiss anyone. It's just that I feel like the city has more to offer than right downtown, Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Wicker Park, and the ""civic worker suburb"" neighborhoods. The places where the claims of danger seem to be consistently backed up are some of the inner South Side (Fulton Park, Washington Park, Grand Crossing, Englewood) and West Garfield Park, plus a few small areas near them.

Am I the only one who feels like this? I hope I'm not just missing something.

\* Both the hipster and non-hipster parts.

Where do you park when the street spots are all taken where you live?,"Hey there. My bad if this question has been asked a bunch of times. I am considering moving to Chicago but quickly realizing that owning a car can be costly and having a place to put it is tricky.

(Before you suggest - no I don't wish to sell my car. I just bought a new one and I enjoy it. lol)

I visited earlier this month and was walking around some of the neighborhoods a little up north. I noticed that on the residential streets, a lot of the cars were bumper to bumper (which made me wonder what people do when they're gridlocked in and can't get out), and there were no empty spots available.

Car owners -  when the street/surrounding streets where you live have no spots left, where do you go? Do you just go block by block until you find one? I keep thinking of the scenario of coming home late when the spots on my street are all taken and having to walk multiple blocks to my apartment alone at night - I'm a woman and this generally just makes me anxious. Is this just a reality of having a car in chicago? Or are some areas less crowded as far as street parking availability goes? I understand that paid parking in a garage/alley is sometimes available, but in areas where there are a lot of mid rise apartments/walk-ups, that doesn't seem to be plentiful. Just trying to understand all of my options.

**Edit: WOW. I did not expect so many responses. I was so sure I'd get alot of sarcastic answers or people telling me not to bother coming. Thank you to everyone who provided insight, these responses are very helpful -**  even some of the snarky ones **lol. I still haven't read them all but after work I will revisit the thread and use this to fine tune what I'm looking for. It sounds like getting a paid spot is ideal, and cars are still not recommended, especially new ones. Not sure why I got downvoted when someone asked what area I was looking to live in, I was just... answering the question... but nevertheless, I appreciate yall. I think Chicago is a great city and I hope everything works out for me to relocate there!**",AskChicago,56,1730400725.0,273,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1gglzkj/where_do_you_park_when_the_street_spots_are_all/
Please help me become street-smart as a foreigner. What should I do?,"
Hello Chicagoans!

I am an international high school student from Korea who enjoys solo-travel and jazz. I am 16 and turning 17 next month. I came to Chicago alone and now pursuing my dream here. I really do love Chicago.


However, yesterday, I was outside north side of downtown around 6 pm, and was waiting for bus(22, clark &amp; elm). There was a homeless man sitting on the bench I didn't really pay attention to him.

However, out of nowhere, a man with a small knife approached to the bus stop where me and him were and pointed the knife at the homeless man's neck. My gut told me to leave, so i quickly started walking away from the bus stop. I could hear the homeless man starting to cough, and i felt something very dangerous might have happened. As soon as i realized I got pretty far away from the bus stop, i called 911 and explained everything that I saw and exact location to the operator and the call ended with her saying she sent the cops. Even after the call ended, I still felt frightened that I completely lost my sense of direction; I was wandering around the same area for 20 minutes, looking for a bus stop so I can go home.

After several hours later I started to feel okay but still now I am a bit scared of what happened that day. It was my very first time dialing 911. I am still wondering if I handled the situation correctly…

Before this happened, i used to go out alone and enjoy free jazz performances even until like 9:00 pm. But after this happened i just feel like staying at home. Im scared to go outside. 


1. Does this type of incident happen often  in Chicago?

2. What time would you guys recommend me to be home for safety, if i were your daughter?

3. Which part of Chicago should I avoid at most? Specific details would be really helpful. 

Thank you so much guys for your time.

Edit:  i never expected my post to get this much attention. First off, I want to genuinely thank all of you for your thoughtful comments. This was my first time sharing a personal experience on Reddit, and you’ve all been incredibly sweet and caring.

if any of my friends ever visit Chicago, I’ll just have them to this thread. it feels like a full guide. 

Thank you again to each and every one of you. Wishing you all a wonderful rest of 2024 !!",AskChicago,206,1735441920.0,109,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1homqcn/please_help_me_become_streetsmart_as_a_foreigner/
How bad is the red line really?,"I live in andersonville and just recently got a job in river north, and I will have to take the red line alone to get to work every day. I have been hearing absolute horror stories and how you will pretty much have someone threaten you or have something bad happen if you take the red line frequently. I asked one of my friends who is from chicago and she said as long as you don’t go on it at night I will be fine, and it’s a 9-5 job so I don’t think that will be a problem but I worry about the time change when it will be dark when I get off work. I bring my taser with me everywhere and plan on getting mace as well, but is it really that bad? I went and visited the office today and took the red line around 1 and did NOT know to not sit in the last car and did both going there and coming back, and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I moved here from Alabama so I have no experience with this. If someone does try to come up to me and bother me what would be your best advice on how to handle that situation? Ignore them? Tell them to fuck off? What about if someone tries to follow me? ",AskChicago,0,1757199912.0,96,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1nadjta/how_bad_is_the_red_line_really/

"What time does the L become ""unsafe""? If at all?","Hey everyone - 

  
Traveling to Chicago in June for my bachelor weekend, and was planning on utilizing the L quite a bit. 

We are staying in the Pilsen neighborhood, so the Pink line is going to be our main transport. I have used the L (specifically Pink line) a lot when I travel in for Riot Fest, but have never used it during just a normal weekend. 

So the question is, is there a certain time of night we should consider getting an uber? Or is the L generally safe throughout the night?

Half of us live in St. Louis, so we know that a big part if just being aware of your surroundings. But, being stuck on a train is a lot different than just walking on the street.",AskChicago,0,1768252895.0,40,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1qb7np1/what_time_does_the_l_become_unsafe_if_at_all/
What's really going on in the South Loop?,"TLDR; Opinions on Sentral, The Cooper or 1000 South Clark? Also, more importantly, what's really going on at Roosevelt Station/nearby area? UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who responded. In case it isn't clear, I don't think anything of Chicago besides it's lovely and like any other major city. I just wanted to get a better understanding of what I've read on Reddit and was trying to offset the ridiculous nature of this post with humor!

UPDATE 2.0: **Final update, I promise.** I just wanted to say thanks again–y’all are really kind and reading your experiences has been very helpful. *Thanks for being my grain*s *of salt!* **If any of y’all in the South Loop (or nearby) want some new friends, DM me if you're interested in meeting up. My partner and I don't know anyone in Chicago and are starting from scratch.** Thanks again everyone!

**Background**: My partner and I are moving to Chicago (for work). With that being said, we're pretty stoked about it because we both fell in love with it when we visited a few years ago. We have lived primarily in the NE, specifically NYC (both Manhattan and the Bronx).

**Why the South Loop:** We've looked at a few areas, and we both seem pretty happy with Printer's Row/South Loop. We've read several threads, and we understand it can be a *sleepy* area, and that's fine with us. We have no issue traveling to other areas if we want to go out. We're pretty set with a few solid coffee shops and small businesses. Another reason we're set on it is the proximity to the park and the lake. Being close to green spaces is important to us, and we wanted to be within a quick walking distance.

Cool. Hopefully that answers anyone who might be asking *why* we're looking at this area. **We've found a couple of buildings that have interested us (Sentral, The Cooper, 1000 South Clark), so if you have any personal experiences, please share.**

Otherwise, my main question is this: **I've read that a lot of people love the South Loop, but it seems like even when people have nothing but good things to say... they all still mention Roosevelt station.** Now, we've ridden the NYC subway day and night, we've lived in some sketchy neighborhoods when we were broke college kids, and all of that was... fine. *Sus*, but, ultimately, fine. So, is everyone being dramatic? Have y'all never lived in another major city? Should we be looking elsewhere? Is it just the station–i.e. is it self-contained?–or is it the entire area? I don't even think we'll be taking the train often since we like walking when possible, but clue me in *please (am I going to get murdered? jk)*

I don't want to live somewhere where I'm constantly being harassed or where I'm scared to have my girlfriends/family visit. They're all already up in the air about Chicago being dangerous, and I hate being told ""I told you so."" My partner and I agree that any major city can be dangerous (uh, cue NYC), but are we walking ourselves into some kind of miserable (ahem, dangerous) trap? I seriously cannot get a clear read from everything I've read.

PS. Yes, we're going to visit in person, but visiting is very different than living. So, if you have lived experience, that's what we're hoping to read/understand.

Questions about my safety in Chicago?,"Me and my girlfriend were at a rave in Chicago on are way back to our car which was at least 10 mins away. There was a man who had stopped and was cat calling my girlfriend and she kept saying no and we kept telling him to leave us alone. We tried walking away from him and he kept following us with his car so we’re scared atp we keep telling him to leave us alone and he keeps on following us so I call the cops and we ended up coming across a group of people and that’s when he decided to finally stop following and drove off. We were in Pilsen, do things like this happen in Chicago often? You think his intentions were to kidnap my girlfriend? I told one of my family members and they said that people prey and lurk outside of parties for young kids to snatch. is Chicago really that bad to where even if your minding your own business you can still come across something scary like that ? Cuz I live in nwi which is 30-40 mins from Chicago. I always ways thought as long as you don’t associate yourself with criminal or gang activity you’d be fine am I wrong ? 

The thing I’m worried abt is what were his intentions if we hadn’t came across that group of people what would’ve happen?? That’s what’s scares the shit out of me like I got lucky that night. 

And do people really lurk outside of parties trying to prey on young adults or is that not exclusive to Chicago as well, but kind of part of every major city?",AskChicago,0,1758558192.0,46,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1nnr2kp/questions_about_my_safety_in_chicago/
Do you walk home from the bus stop/train station alone at night?,"Hello!

I’m moving to Chicago from SoCal in a few months, and I’m so excited! I love the city and can’t wait to live there full time. 

I’m not planning on bringing my car, but one of my biggest hang-ups around this is dealing with transportation at night (I’m not talking super deep into the night, just when it’s dark out). It’s not that I think that once the sun goes down, mayhem erupts, but as a newcomer to the city and a woman, I want to make sure I’m safe. 

If you’re taking public transpo at night, do you generally walk home from the station? Do you feel safe?

I’m hoping to live somewhere on the north side, and my goal is to live near transit. But in thinking about home in LA, I’d never walk alone from our red line unless my destination was literally across the street. Is this something I should prepare for??

Best lakefront neighborhood in Chicago?,"Which lakefront Chicago neighborhood would be a good fit for a single 45 year old woman moving to Chicago that doesn’t know a soul there?

*Safe to walk around by myself
*Rent budget is up to $2,000 but could be stretched to $2,500 for the perfect location. 
*A variety of good local restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, jazz clubs and/or within walking proximity to these spots
*Close to a Whole Foods and/or more grocery

Can you please critique my itinerary/give suggestions for next time?,"My sister and I came to Chicago last Thursday and overall it was a good experience. 

First Day:
-took CTA orange line to hotel 
-Went to Nutella cafe — good since we like Nutella 
-Strolled millenium park 
-Went to the Maggie Daley park — I love the Pedestrian Bridge don’t know why lol 
-Got lunch from Chicago dawgs — loved it but it was too acidic for my sis. Didn’t realize they didn’t the poppy seed bun there 😭
-Visited the Fine arts building— just to ride the manual elevator 😅
-Visited the Chicago cultural center— I love that place!!
-Went to Palmer House hotel— great architecture
-Architecture Boat Tour with Wendella— amazing experience. We booked 7:30 so we were able to get the sunset plus city lights at night time 
-Grabbed dinner from Wilma’s famous BBQ— we were tired and hungry after the tour and randomly chose this but it wasn’t good… 
-Ubered and walked to get around

Second Day: 
-Took the water taxi to Chinatown 
-Strolled Ping Tom Memorial Park 
-went to the Chinese American museum 
-got lunch from the Richland center — can’t remember where; was ok I think I picked wrong 
-Walked all over Chinatown square 
-Walked the area where the Pui Tak Center is, got food etc.
-We picked up dinner from Go 4 Food and it was sooo good! Their duck was delicious 
-We took the bus to go back to our hotel 
-We went to the Starbucks Reserve at nighttime 

Third Day:
-Got breakfast from Medici on 57th 
-Walked all over the university of Chicago campus, saw the Rockfeller memorial etc
-Went to ISAC
-Went to Midway Plaisance Park and we got to talk to some locals who were having a huge “HS reunion” type stuff 
-Went to 57th street beach 
-Had a late lunch at 14 Parish — the jibarito was good!
-Went to Jackson park, Japanese garden etc
-Walked Museum Campus a little bit 
This was the hardest day cause we kept getting lost… we walked so much! And then we got a taxi (not uber this time) when we wanted to go from 14 Paris to Jackson park and we ended up telling him to just drop us off wherever. We got into his vehicle and he didn’t follow the route then when we mapped it ourselves and realized we were too far from where he wanted to drop us off at, and when we told him he said that we entered the wrong address on purpose to it could be cheaper. We were like ok cool thanks we’d rather walk than deal with this 
-Later that night we went to LH Rooftop. Didn’t even get drinks but the view was everything!!! 

Fourth Day:
-Walked the RiverWalk — very scenic 
-Walked to Grant park to see the fountain etc. 
-Didn’t have time to visit the Art Institute but I went to the gardens 
-Then I got on the bus to go back towards La Salle… and ended up on 24th and Balbo street cause I got on the bus going in the opposite direction. The bus driver told me to get off, cross the sreet and get on the next bus. I must admit that I was a bit scared cause I didn’t see much activity around and idk the area. 
-The we got Lou Malnatis pizza - it was very disappointing lol I know better based on reviews but my sis wanted it 
-Then we transferred over to Lincoln park and went to the Zoo and conservatory 
-We went to Art Effect on Armitage 
-We went to several shops in Lincoln Square 
-We had dinner at Ciccio Mio and it was the best meal I’ve had during my stay 

Last Day: 
-Did a little shopping on Mag Mile
-Transferred over to Armitage (again) because I really wanted to visit the little quirky shops there 
-Then we did WNDR museum — super underwhelming but my sister wanted to 

I wish I had planned out the food better but I was more interested in seeing and doing things. 

All the horror stories I heard abt Chicagoans being rude turned out to be false. People were so nice and helpful. Not everyone was super smily but they were nice and they even say hi when passing you on the streets. 

Overall I think Chicago is a great city to visit and I can’t wait to be back!

Wife (26f) and I (28m)Moving are to Chicago soon! ( extremely excited ) We would love help with any and all possible advice please?,"Hi Y’all!! My wife (26f) and I (28m) are relocating to Chicago in less than 7 months and we are in desperate need for any and all advice y’all can give! She works part/full time the live theater and film industry ( lighting design, pyrotechnics, production management, touring, stage hand etc……) and also finishing college while I’m in the military and also moonlighting in live theater and film ( Stunt/Fight choreographer, director, actor/comedian etc……) as well as occasionally working private events as a private chef. We both do a whole lot of random things in our respective careers 😂😂. After active duty, we plan on staying while I finish college. Here’s what we need help with!!! (Any possible information matter how small y’all might think it is a huge stress relief) 

1. What are some areas to look to rent that within our budget ( 2800-3000 ) while also having our pets. We have cats and a dog ( under 50 lbs ).
What are the main places we should avoid? 
We’re also more than willing to live just outside the city as well.

2. What is the general cost of living and is having our cars is worth it? 

3. What are the best places to work / what are the best ideas on how to break into the theatre and music scenes ( technical theatre mainly )? Both of us are pretty set in the sheer amount of experience in our fields and in general don’t find it to difficult to get work in most areas, but it’s is always difficult to start in a new area. Especially in one like Chicago where it is heavily implied to be one of the best cities in America for live entertainment ( generally second only to NYC ). Any and all possible advice on this is especially heavily appreciated !!! 

4. What is life actually like there? I know it’s cold AF in the winter with a metric F*** ton of snow and it’s decent and warm in the summer. What should we prepare for while living there? What is general pace of the city? (Examples being; what time do most places close, how loud is the residential areas ,to walk or not to walk , and things of that nature ) 

5. What are some good local businesses to look out for? We especially would love of any local bookstores and game shops that y’all would actually recommend.

6. What is Chicago culture like!? Any specific Chicago native things we should know? What are the most fun and interesting places or things to go to/do (both tourist and non-tourists)? Also ,in general,how friendly/ not friendly are the people ? What to do/say or what not to say/do in social situations that wouldn’t be commonplace in other areas of the country? Stuff like how you shouldn’t say “Go Pats” in a NYC bar or how gettin called a “Yank” or “Yankee” is an insult in the Deep South. 
This one is pretty big for us. We generally have a harder time making friends because we’re both pretty introverted and we’re trying to fix that 😂. We don’t want it to take another 2 years for us to feel confident/comfortable enough in the area to go out and try making any friends …..again. 

7. I know y’all’s food scene is amazing! What are some of y’all’s best recommendations for eateries that wouldn’t be found by just a casual search?

8. Lastly what should we know about the city itself? Where should we avoid at night / what are the big danger areas to look out for? What are the safest areas ? What are common dilemmas? What are some big praises you have for the city? How bad is traffic ? Most importantly what are the main recommendations for grocery and general stores?

We are ridiculously nervous for this move but we are also extremely excited to be moving to what is essentially our dream city!!! 

Thank y’all’ for taking the time to read this!!! I know it is a lot but again absolutely ANY possible advice is greatly appreciated!!!



P.s I know this is a long post already but I have one more. This one is very niche, mostly for working/ former working theatre folk , but again any info is welcome and this one is nowhere near as pressing.

Any advice on which college should we focus on attending in the area ? ( Technical theatre and Acting/directing respectively ) 

We both just want to finish our degrees so we can teach full-time at the collegiate level.
We have both been burnt by attending / working in un-characteristically shitty programs. Ones that want/need, but unfortunately just don’t have, the resources for their students. Really only choosing them due to the fact they were the some of the few in the area that had the programs and that they allowed my wife to attend for free because I was an adjunct.
One of the main reasons we chose Chicago is due to the future ability, and the unfortunate self-satisfying desire from both of us, to finish our degrees . 

Due to the military, money is not a high factor in this decision . We are mostly just in debate of which one each of us should try for. 

Edit: Thank y’all so far!!! Just clarifying one thing, I am still active duty for a few years. Due to this we can afford to just live on my income alone during that time. 

Edit 2: We have not visited yet as I got my orders yesterday. As soon as we can we plan on making a trip out to visit / scope the area. We both have lived in different major cities for different periods of our lives ( NYC for 2yrs, Orlando for 4 ). We are leaving a much smaller area though with this move ( Newport, RI )",AskChicago,0,1751601753.0,32,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1lr9bio/wife_26f_and_i_28mmoving_are_to_chicago_soon/

How safe is it for me to travel alone as a girl to Chicago for a concert?,"I’m going to a concert in Chicago later in October. I am planning on going alone since I only brought one ticket.

Honest thoughts about Bronzeville concerning safety (specifically for women)?,"Edit #1 9/8/25: I added that I read posts in this subreddit from 3-5 ish years ago with similar questions and am wondering if anything has changed since then. I read the neighborhood notes from the subreddit. I am also in a group on Facebook for women based in Chicago and so far a few women said they have enjoyed living there and feel safe. 

Edit #2 9/8/25: Corrected statement about Hyde Park being a 10 minute walk from the house. It is actually a 32 minute walk and a 7 minute car ride and 16 minutes away by public transit. 

Hi! My boyfriend and I are looking to move to buy a house in Bronzeville. The house is about a 7-minute drive to Hyde Park. I’ve read older posts dated a few years ago similar to this one regarding the safety of Bronzeville, and was wondering what your thoughts are and if anything has changed since I read those older posts. 

We have done a little bit of research on the area to evaluate what kind of crime may be present. I would be likely living there by myself to settle in for a few months while my boyfriend moves everything from a different state entirely. I’m wanting to know how safe it is for women to walk around by themselves (while of course following basic safety tips such as not looking completely clueless and not walking around late at night). 

I read that the Green line is alright during the day but that it can get dicey at night. 

Please give your honest feedback about the area. I am new to Chicago aside from having visited a handful of times, and while I do have some general understandings of what areas to avoid, I am especially curious about Bronzeville. My understanding is that Bronzeville has a significant history within Chicago. 

Thank you!

How intense is Fright Fest at Great America?,"My boyfriend, sister and I are scheduled to take three 10 year olds to Great America on Saturday. The plan is to be there from 2:00-7:30 pm. We made this plan without doing much reading about Fright Fest.

I finally did some research and am a little concerned about the scare zones. Partially for the kids, but my sister and boyfriend are pretty jumpy and would not do well with jump scares or being chased.

I read that the scare zones are on the way to some of the rides. The biggest ride we’ll go on is the Demon. Otherwise it’ll be a lot of spinning rides, the Whizzer and the big ship ride. Can we do rides and avoid the scare zones? Do the No Boo necklaces really work or are they hard for the actors to see in the moment? 

Update: Adding this in case someone looking for similar info finds this. We walked around to rides for about two hours after the scary zones started. We all had no boo necklaces which seemed effective (except for an actor who rolled up on one of the kids and growled “turn it off” at her). 

What we didn’t really think about is how other people would be reacting to the actors. It was very dark and groups of people were running/jumping to get away from the actors. We had to bob and weave to get out of the way. And seeing groups of people running while screaming was jarring, especially in these times. Even though our conscious brains knew exactly what was happening, it still set off major fear reactions in the adults. 

The decorations/set dressing was awesome but you can see most of it when it’s still light out. 

I don’t know if we’ll ever go again but if we do, we’ll stick to the daytime hours. ",AskChicago,0,1761187708.0,7,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1ods43o/how_intense_is_fright_fest_at_great_america/
commute from ogilvie to north chicago?,"I've scoped out the Metra train and it looks like it would be 1 hour 45 minutes total if I'm walking to the station and from the station to my destination. 1 hour 20 minutes if I am riding my bike. 

I do have a car and considered this as well but have heard horror stories about the rush hour traffic. Google says between 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes by car in the morning, 50 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes in the evening. It gets better the closer to 6pm I get. 

  
Which would you do? Are there any alternate routes that avoid traffic coming from west loop to North Chicago?

The Metra sounds nice but looking at videos of the inside it doesn't seem like the greatest place to sit for 1.5 hours. If they had outlets I could plug into that's obviously a game changer because then I could do stuff on my computer to kill time. Alternatively driving has the potential to be a shorter ride (if google maps estimation is correct) but far more boring and will feel longer because I'm driving versus getting work done or reading a book or playing a game. 

  
If I were to drive in the middle of the night to North Chicago, it'd be a 40 minute drive. Zero traffic, I can't make it a shorter commute than that. If I can get my commute close to this guaranteed, that'd be ideal. 

Let me know what y'alls thoughts are on riding the Metra, especially for that long - in comparison to driving instead. Particularly if you know any side streets I could take that would avoid a lot of traffic.

One night (tonight) and one day with 2 little girls…,"
My 3 and 5 year old and I are in Chicago for the next 24 hours…. Silly story but getting into Chicago at 5pm, staying at the Drake Hotel (my dad insisted/paid for it because we are picking up my brother tomorrow at 5pm from O’Hare).

So looking for easy with kids dinner and lunch recs… as well as things to do. My plan was Shedd Aquarium and Field Museum but idk if other spots might be more fun. My 5yo is obsessed with Ancient Egypt and Greece. They love art and animals and dinosaurs and princesses, etc but we live in Houston and have great museums (childrens museums and a Color Factory) as well. 

I personally like fun/funky/interactive art installations (they did Meow Wolf over Spring Break and crushed). Its gonna be hot but didnt bring swimsuits so dont want to do beach/splash pads.

Food-wise they love pizza (more thin crust gals than deep dish but open to spots bonus points if near the Drake and quick-ish), Mexican food, typical American kid crap (burgers, shakes, fries, tendies, etc), and they LOVE breakfast. Diners, pancakes/eggs, etc.

What you got?!

EDIT: thank yall so much for all the recs!!! 

We did Pistores for pizza last night (no one recommended but Eater… I wasn’t impressed), walked to Tempo Cafe at 7:30am, stopped to talk to alllll the puppies, Lincoln Park Zoo (found street parking!), El Tragon Taqueria (bomb gas station quesadillas, horchata, and tortas), Cloud Gate/Millennium Park/Maggie Daley Playground, and Art Institute (saw the Greek/Roman sculptures, Georgia OKeefe, and Ryan Learning Center!!!)

An uptick in crime on East Division street- Join me in emailing Brian Hopkins?,"In the past few months, there’s been a major rise in crime along East Division Street, especially between State and Lake Shore Drive. With all the congestion near Dearborn and State, more people are walking or calling Ubers home around Astor &amp; Division — and that area has turned into a hotspot for robberies and assaults. Criminals are clearly targeting people who are walking alone or leaving bars.

My boyfriend was recently the victim of an attempted robbery at 11:30 PM , not even that late for a weekend. It’s unacceptable that we can’t feel safe walking in our own neighborhood. I sent the following message to Alderman Brian Hopkins and encourage others to do the same or speak out:

Subject: Urgent Request for Increased Security on East Division Street

Dear Alderman Hopkins,

I’m writing as a concerned resident of the Gold Coast neighborhood regarding the alarming spike in crime along East Division Street, particularly between State Street and Lake Shore Drive.

Since the recent openings of the Galleria Club and Gold Coast Social, our neighborhood has experienced a troubling increase in robberies, assaults, and even murders. What was once a quiet and safe residential area has become unrecognizable—and unsafe.

It is unacceptable that residents no longer feel safe walking in their own neighborhood. I am asking you to take immediate action by: •	Increasing the presence of police or private security patrols during evening and late-night hours •	Implementing a curfew or stricter enforcement of loitering and noise ordinances for nightlife venues •	Re-evaluating the licenses and community impact of establishments contributing to this unsafe environment

I hope you will treat this issue with the urgency it deserves before further harm is done. We need leadership that protects residents and restores peace to our community.

⸻

If you’ve experienced anything similar or are just tired of feeling unsafe in this neighborhood, please speak up or contact Alderman Hopkins. We need pressure from the community to get real change.",AskChicago,11,1750037574.0,18,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1lcglpt/an_uptick_in_crime_on_east_division_street_join/
Does anyone want a trip report after my last post asking itinerary feedback?,"A while ago I asked this sub for some itinerary feedback and I'm thinking that maybe y'all want to know about my trip here!

Best hotdog award goes to:
Maxwell St Depot. Loved the grilled onions!

Best place to eat goes to:
The cafe in the art institute. I snagged a bite off my husband's burger and it was so good! The outdoor seating was just really great as well and we snagged a table before they got really busy. It was so relaxing.

Hotel Hyatt regency 4/5:
I don't understand how a 5 star hotel has a $25 daily fee? But then gave us a $25 nightly restaurant credit? At that point why have a fee? I don't know. I don't usually book fancy 5 star hotels. Also they have someone checking out the room once a day even if you don't request room service. They messed with the thermostat and scared the daylights out of me when they left a hair product gift on a table. Very weird. The view of the river/lake from the room is nice but I'm thinking that if we were to come back I would love to stay in a local brick apartment situation in a neighborhood by a train station.

Activities we did out of a 5 rating.
Architecture boat ride 5/5.
Loved learning about the city and now I can say I have a favorite building!

Rate Field 5/5.
Loved watching the game here. I think it's cool how there are fireworks for every home run. We went during a Comiskey bobblehead day and they had historic footage on the big screen. Which was really cool for us baseball nerds.

Wrigley Field 100/5.
It's a must do. What can I say? It's so crazy to think of the age of the stadium here and how many people watched a game here. And it's even crazier to think about all the baseball stars that played. Easily the most engaged fans I've ever seen at a ball game. We were all standing on a potential strike out pitch. What was really cool was the game winning songs/flags. They definitely don't show that on TV at home! I'm really glad that the Cubs won because I feel like we could have missed out on that experience.

The art institute/cloud gate combo 5/5
I'm a bit of an art nerd and I love the roman statue exhibit. My husband isn't really too big of a fan but he had a good time following me around and explaining art pieces to him and the significance of it. We walked around here for SIX HOURS and we still didn't see everything.

Regrets:
I needed better shoes and a better jacket. I was delusional with converse and a zip up fleece.

We were walking around China town between the park and grabbing a few drinks at Reggie's trying to create an appetite to eat in China town and unfortunately we couldn't get an appetite going.

General thoughts:
The transportation is amazing. Never had any issues. Only qualm is it's busy after a game which duh of course it is.

Chicago truly is massive. It almost feels like it's 3 different cities in one. It makes my big town in my state look like a tiny peanut.

People here are honestly very nice. I've done city living before and generally you do as the Romans, don't block a sidewalk, don't stop randomly, don't be in the way while taking pictures, and don't speak to strangers unless you're spoken to. But the strangers that we did chatted with loved the city and also loved how we were having such a great time. Someone on the red line was really appreciative that we weren't sticking to one area of the city - our goal was to truly see it all. My aching feet is proof haha.

Elderly low-income South Shore apt.: dangerous?,"Sorry for this 3 a.m. rambling post...

I saw on Craigslist Chicago an elderly/disabled 62 and older low-income apartment,  charging 30% of one's income. 

I am very low income, so should qualify. 

From pictures I've seen around various internet sites, the building looks low income -- no surprise there.

But I don't mind spartan, just not dangerous. 

It's at 6900 S. Crandon Ave/Street.  Zip code 60649.  The ad calls it the South Shore neighborhood (or is South Shore an area more than a neighborhood?).

Yes, I've done online searches, and it's far from the Loop and northside by public transit.

Even a CVS or Walgreens seems a mile or more walk, but I think an Aldi is near but no Jewel, Trader Joe's or Whole Foods Market in such a zip code, unsurprising.

Seems kind of close to the Lake and beaches and a cultural center...but still maybe a hassle to regulary access on foot?

Maybe a branch library nearby?

...

I have lived in the Boston area all my adult life and enjoy and appreciate its relatively high quality of living, despite the high cost of rents.

But I might need to relocate to Chicago for a friend, and I've always liked the ""desirable""  parts of Chicago on my two very brief visits, in 1994 and 2011.

I'm a hockey fan, so would cheer for the Blackhawks!  I guess this neighborhhood cheers for the White Sox, not the Cubs?

I am a gay, white, husky male, somewhat strong, but can't really fight well if attacked.  I have a Bachelor's degree, but have done blue collar jobs most of my life. Will I not fit in in this zip code? Maybe not too gay friendly around there?

Oh, I can't afford your north side gay-friendly neighborhoods.

Just stay away from that vicinity, or might be worth it for low rent and to live alone?

Problem is I like to ride the safer parts of Boston subways and trolleys...whether for errands or even fun and relaxation!...of course I encounter some disturbed people, but I can tolerate them if not dangerous. If I nod off in the daytime wnd even nights on the parts of our transit I use, I don't fear my safety.

Yes, I understand I couldn't safely do that in much of Chicago's transit system, at leasf at night.

And I like to stroll the safer neighbors in Boston and nearby...even at night, and I feel comfortable.  

But not sure I could safely walk from the Chicago public transit station or bus stop to this address at night, but daytime should be fine? And I think I read it's not that near an actual subway line but closer to a ""Metra?"" line into downtown?  Hmmm...

Thanks!

...oh, and I'm not sure if I should post such questions in the main Chicago sub or here.

New Yorker Moving to Chicago,"I’ve (F27) only known NYC all my life. Yes, I have traveled but I’ve never lived anywhere outside of Brooklyn. My husband (M28), moved to NY from CA when he started college. We started dating in our sophomore year of college and he decided to permanently live in NY to be close with me after graduation. We just got married in March of this year, but we have been living in a (walk-in) basement since the start of the pandemic. We are just 3 blocks away from my parents. As an only child, my parents have had strict hold over me, such as not letting me dorm for college, tracking my location, etc. I think all that plus past emotional trauma with my dad being controlling over my social life has led me to develop anxiety.

They only let me move out with my now-husband before the pandemic because they didn’t want me to keep “being exposed to the outside” whenever I walked over to my husband’s apartment in the morning (every day) and come back to my parents’ house at night. 

Fast forward to today, my husband recently applied to law school and got accepted with a full ride to one of the schools in Chicago! We just got this news literally last week and we’ve been so excited - we can finally move out of NYC to be on our own and be independent for once as newlyweds. We broke the news to his family and my team at work. I’ve been avoiding having a sit-down with my parents because I’m scared of the backlash or them being upset. We both deserve the freedom. To get out of this basement, live our life elsewhere. We decided to break the news to them this weekend (tomorrow!!!). We plan to move at the end of July, so that’s pretty soon.

I’m super nervous but sorry for this long rant. I guess what I’m asking is…

- As a New Yorker, how should I prepare for our big move to Chicago, both mentally and physically?
- We have no family or friends there but my husband’s family lives about 3 hours by car from Chicago. He currently works remote and will be doing his law program at night. What are some suggestions for exploring Chicago, making new friends, finding new hobbies?

"Early 40s/F Fine Art Photographer, visiting Chicago Mid Sept. What should I remove/add/replace from my options?","Hi, Y'all. 

I'm a dark botanical photographer from Montreal, QC. Hoping you can provide some insight on my upcoming trip. I really love all kinds of art and anything weird or obscure, dive bars . I also love creative and delicious food/wine, local beer and a well made cocktail without sweetness.   
  
I'll be traveling solo mid-ish September and have been furiously Googling all the things I'd like to do and now I have the problem of too many things on my list.   
  
I'll be there for 5 days but leave on a Saturday, so I don't have a weekend in the city.  Mostly looking for things to cull from my list based on the following:

I'll be staying at a hostel near lincoln park. part of what I love about travelling is the temporary friends you make for the day/evening in bars, cafes, solo dining, etc.  
  
 I have 2 modes, one where I am super engaged and chatty and the other where I feel incredibly uncomfortable and want to crawl out of my skin and they largely depend on vibes of the people there. :)

 I'm in my early 40's (present a bit younger) and mildly witchy/alt/artsy (wear mostly dark or black clothing, tattoos, etc)  and am looking for places that are good for either talking to bartenders (during the day when they're not busy) or regulars that are friendly and welcoming in neighborhoods outside Lincoln Park. Would also love to talk to other artists/fine art photographers/creatives.

 I probably won't be doing late nights with heavy drinking, but would like to see local live acts close to my hostel (near Lincoln Park)

 For the evenings, I would, in large prefer to stay around the Lincoln Park area where I could walk back to my hostel, but if there's a spot I shouldn't miss or that's close to one of the restaurants on my list, I'm open.

These are the places/touristy stuff/shopping I have so far. Are there any things that I might have missed or should skip? 

Also, for any photographers, should I bother bringing a wide angle lens based on street configurations/architectural detail etc or will I be okay with a 55-250mm f/4-5.6? 

Based on the above, will I feel uncomfortable at any of the bars/restaurants on my list having a drink/dining alone?

Tourist Stuff:

-Architectural boat tour (for the photography, open to alternatives)  
-MCA  
-Museum Of Contemporary Photography

Dining Solo for Breakfast/lunch and dinner. 

Only two I know for sure I must go to are Tyzub and Indienne. Open for opinions to the rest.

  Not veg but am 'carry an EpiPen allergic' to crustaceans (not mollusks or fish) and prefer not having to ask for substitutions for tasting menus or worrying about potential accidents/contamination/hidden crustacean (nam phrik kapi, bouillabaisse, some fish stocks, etc)  :

-RR #1  
-Komoda

"New Grad Moving to Chicago (Transit, Airport, Safety, Green Spaces, etc.)","Hi everyone! Like some previous posts here, I am considering moving to Chicago soon. To focus the discussion a bit (and help you all think about recommendations), I have identified some of my must-haves and hopes and some previous research I have done.

About Me:

* Remote job, but occasionally will need to travel domestically (sometimes outside of the Chicago area)
* Mid-20s living alone

Must haves:

* Budget: One-bedroom apartment under $1500. (edit: is this reasonable or too low?)
* Public transit: CTA (bus and/or the L) is a must, Metra would be nice but not necessary.
* Decent access to airports: I will be traveling occasionally as a part of my job, including going to airports. I prefer to be closer to O'Hare because I also use that airport to fly home. Think 75 minutes to O'Hare with transit max. For Midway, I am less concerned right now.
* Safety: Generally I am hearing that other than some south neighborhoods, places are safe as long as I avoid a couple of blocks in any neighborhood. Correct me if I am wrong for the neighborhoods you are aware of.
* Groceries: Walking or transit distance - 15 minutes.
* Retail: A good number of restaurants, shops, and cafes. It does not have to be like downtown, but I would like to eat out sometimes!
* Green space: Generally I would like to have sidewalks that have green space in the residential parts of town so that I don't go crazy. Some good parks nearby are a plus!

Hopes: Access to gyms nearby

I also had some time to visit some of the neighborhoods that people mentioned on this thread or others during the day. Here are my (personal) reactions. Feel free to comment on my observations as well, as I just walked around in the following areas:

* Edgewater/Uptown: A good hub for young people and a good mix of families and elders. Having Lake Michigan is nice, quiet residential areas, and good pockets of restaurants and shops. The only con here is that going to O'Hare in particular takes more than an hour.
* Old Town: I saw more housing complexes than individual houses (just observation). There's good stuff to do in Wells Street (pretty good and lively).
* Palmer Square / Logan Square: Less red brick buildings south of Logan Square, more red brick in Palmer Square; Boulevards! Heard that these areas are on the expensive side...?
* Avondale: There are houses of various styles and colors, which I liked. Good amount of green space.
* Jefferson Park: I went south of the Metra/CTA transit center and the Jefferson Park (park) is a bit barren so I personally didn't like that. I also saw the north side has a better variety of houses than the south side (splitting by that transit center).

These following neighborhoods I did not have a chance to go to: Wicker Park / Bucktown area and Lake View.

This is a lot of information, but hope you all have something to start your discussions. I really appreciate all your help!",AskChicago,0,1716817673.0,28,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1d1rx96/new_grad_moving_to_chicago_transit_airport_safety/
Where can I park in Rogers Park without being towed?,"Help needed--parking around Rogers Park

UPDATE: I went to a currency exchange and got my parking stickers. So easy! Thanks all for your help. 

TLDR I have a car and I need to park it on the street as near to Loyola Ave as possible without getting towed or playing musical cars every 2-4 hours parking and reparking, or paying exorbitant structure fees. I am unwilling to sell my car--long story but an absolute dealbreaker.

Context: 

Hello all, I've just moved to the Loyola area. I love it, I can walk to the lake (!), but parking is such a pain--seems like it's all a tow zone at random hours so you can never be safe. 😂 It was $119 to stay in a structure for 7 days but that's not sustainable.

I've applied for my parking sticker and should hear back within 10 days, but it's the gov so I expect they'll draw out the process for weeks. That's how it is in Michigan, maybe it's better here. In the meantime, is there an area you know of that's safe to park in either all the time or in longer blocks than 2-4 hours? Maybe a side street in a suburbanish area (bearing in mind I'm a petite woman who would be walking alone very late at night at times so can't go too far out of radius).

For the Swifties next weekend,"Friendly neighborhood Uber driver here with some unsolicited BUT possibly time saving advice. 

Whatever you do, try not to get an Uber or Lyft directly to and from Soldier Field for the concert. The traffic will crush your soul. And even more devastating will be trying to get a ride afterwards. Just don’t. 

Here’s what you’re gonna do. It’s very simple. And it will save you so much time. 

Set your destination for a tiny little green space in the prairie district called “Battle of Ft Dearborn park” (I was gonna upload a pic of it on google maps but I forgot this sub doesn’t allow photos). It’s an unassuming little park, not much goes on except for one beautiful shortcut to Soldier Field. 

Follow the signs for the 18th street pedestrian bridge. There will be a path. The bridge will take you over the metra tracks and dump you in a parking lot across from Soldier Field. From there it’s a short walk to the stadium. Total walking time from the park to the stadium is 10-15 depending on your stride (and your excitement as you laugh at all the donkeys stuck on the highway)

When you’re done just do the reverse and call an Uber or Lyft when you’re over the bridge back into the neighborhood. It’s very safe and very quiet. More and more people are learning about this easy pickup but not enough to make it unmanageable. If you find hordes of Swifties waiting at the park, there are multiple condo/apartment towers you can schlep to and call from there. 

I’ll be out of town so I won’t be driving those nights, but y’all be safe and have fun. Lmk in the comments if you have any questions

Edit: The first comment made a super great point. It escaped my mind. Take care of that neighborhood if you do decide to make the trek over. Be respectful of the residents that live there.

Edit Edit: an awesome Redditor who lives in the neighborhood dropped some really valuable information that I didn’t know about, or have experienced dropping ppl off and picking them up. You most likely won’t get dropped off at the park due to street closures, BUT getting to the park and over the bridge is still easy if you go to the prairie district. Still beats sitting in traffic.",AskChicago,179,1685337757.0,16,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/13ulsas/for_the_swifties_next_weekend/
Strapped Up After Dark: Navigating Chicago’s Streets Safely,"Hey Chicago,

In light of recent discussions and my own experiences walking home late from work, I’ve been pondering the myriad ways we, as a community, keep safe in our bustling city, especially after dark. This isn’t just about me; it’s about all of us navigating our streets when the sun goes down. Whether it’s from a bar shift, a late night at the office, or just an evening out, how do you ensure your personal safety in a non-lethal manner that adheres to our city’s laws?

Let’s broaden the conversation: What strategies, gadgets, or practices have you found effective for staying safe? Also, are there community resources or classes that have been particularly helpful? I believe sharing our collective wisdom can not only offer practical advice but also strengthen our community’s sense of security and camaraderie.

Looking forward to hearing your insights and tips. Let’s make Chicago nightlife safer for everyone.",AskChicago,0,1709671312.0,22,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1b7fyhd/strapped_up_after_dark_navigating_chicagos/
Trying to move to Chicago from out of state in May/June - where in Lakeview would be a good spot for me?,"I’m sorry, I know there’s a lot of these posts. My girlfriend and I are moving to IL from out of state. We visited last year, fell in love with it and have some family ties nearby. 

After a lot of thinking on the right neighborhood, we settled on Lakeview East. We can’t visit extensively right now, but heard it’s a really safe/solid choice to spend your first few year in the city, and has basically everything you need. Sold!

I guess now the question is determining where. Honestly, I don’t want to be in the heart of the chaos, (like in the more fratty areas near Wrigleyville - although I love the Cubs!). I’m close to 30 and really value a quiet home life, but within proximity of a vet, restaurants, public transit, etc. I’m not a huge drinker but I like trying new foods, I’d like to be by the lake where there’s more greenery and places to hang out with my dog. I think safety is sort of number one, and just being near a good CTA stop and some good lightning at night. 

I don’t know if that’s a lot to go off of. I work from home and am about $80k ish per year. My girlfriend is a bit more extroverted, it’ll be her first time living in a city. She wants opportunities to make friends and she’ll need transit for work. She’s also expressed a desire to be near some greenery, but also wants to be close by to bars and restaurants. And like I mentioned, we have a small dog so any areas very close by where he can walk around and hang out is good. I think being around people like us is ideal….sort of in between college grads and parents, I guess. 

I know how annoying I must sound here. I guess I’m just struggling. I’m trying to find and avoid the right property managers (Beal), I’m trying to find maybe the best parts of Lakeview for my personality (I think we both value quiet evenings indoors but being in proximity to fun stuff, although we know being in the city = more noise overall, which is fine - mostly just trying to avoid the young 20s party scene). 

Does anyone maybe have any suggestions on parts of the neighborhood that may be good? Streets, realtors, property groups, anything? Honestly any help is appreciated I’ve been going through a lot the past few months and I’ve tried to do as much research as I can, but actually being able to get some more suggestions from people there would be so so helpful

How (un)safe is Pink + blue line to O’Hare 11pm-2am with big bags?,"So I’ll  to go to O’Hare from California pink line then take the blue line at the loop. I have two bags and will go alone.
For what I’ve read the best is stick to the first car and that it won’t be pleasant anyways.

Is it really “unsafe”? Like what I’ve really find on the posts is like “better Uber” “better if you are not alone” “better the first car” “better not do it” “I wouldn’t risk it” but like I haven’t heard a real reason more than anxiety or fear, does something bad actually happens at this hours on the trains?

Also what you think is the best/safest(?) hour to do the ride between 11pm to 2am? I planned first arriving early leaving at 11pm but on one post I saw people felt a little better early morning than late night, so now I’m considering too, what you think?




——————————— My experience with pink line at midnight and blue line at midnight ———————————

Update of my experience doing this. 
Sorry it became a story time so conclusion: At the end I never felt unsafe and it wasn’t bad for me, but remember there’s always risk and if you have ride alternatives it’s always better to pay a little extra for your safety.

——
I post this here because on my search of pink line at midnight and blue line at midnight there weren’t really many experiences or at least not recent and I’m just gonna put mine here in hope someone else can check it out and see ONE person experience doing this around midnight. (Again this was just MY experience and it doesn’t mean it’s gonna be the same for you, I would hope this was easy and safe for everyone, but there’s still many doubts and people feel unsafe)

So here goes my experience at midnight from California pink line going to Clark and lake and then the blue line to O’Hare on a Sunday.

First what you need to check is what’s your best option, if you have the chance of using Uber/lift or whatever, I wouldn’t doubt about it if I could really afford it (maybe some folks think that if you can travel you have an extra $70 for a ride, but it’s not at all everyone’s option)

Then if you decide to go for public transportation then check options of buses and trains maybe it’s not great traveling on this with luggage but it won’t be for that long and if you think you can deal with that then you go and check the actual times that certain bus/train is working at that certain day, so in my case the last pink train was at 1am and the first at 5am(wouldn’t have worked for me to wait that long)
Then you decide what time to actually leave, I really think, and maybe it’s not a generalized thought, that always better the first train in the morning I.e.5am because there’s might be more people taking it for early shifts or something, or the earliest you can at night so maybe not wait until 1am and this is not just about security but also I’ve read that sometimes the trains at night just don’t arrive and people wait for hours or just go get an Uber because there’s no other option.

You will have to be rested cause you will have to wait long cold hours at the airport on the floor while taking care of your luggage, or just be a warrior and go through the pain with no sleeping, crying and praying. lol

Now how it actually went for me:
I decided to start with this the earliest I could that end up being 11:10pm. I had to walk with my 1 very big luggage, 1 carry on and 1 personal item all over the weight or dimensions limit. It was dark but I didn’t cross paths with any other human being until I was at the pink line station door at 11:20, tbh this 10 minutes where the ones I was actually the most afraid but nothing happened.

Then I had to wait like 10 minutes by myself, on the platform, again there was no one and I didn’t feel unsafe at any moment I actually expected there to be a drunk guy sleeping or something, but nothing.
I got to the first car of the L around 11:30 there where another 6 people with me minding their own business and once again no drunk or drugged guy, no crazy people either.
(AGAIN!!! This was MY experience I really think in most cases at any hour there will be someone making people uncomfortable or at least sleeping idk)
I arrived to Clark and lake before 11:50pm
And the worst part of all this journey was having to get my bag from that platform to the blue line. 
I have to say on the station there were like 2 or 3 guys sleeping but there was more people and even some police officers, so I really felt safe I think I just got lucky… more than usual.

Again it was horrible getting bags down even though there were this smelly slow elevator (you actually have to take 2 of this but hey, there’s at least the option!)
BUT it almost make me lose the blue line train. As soon as the door of the elevator opened, the train audio of doors closing was playing and I rushed to the nearest car of the train, which was the last, so I was getting ready for it to be a really bad experience. But there when I entered at least half of the seats were taken and actually just one homeless guy sleeping there and everyone else minding their own business with their headphones or on their phones, so again I felt safer knowing I wasn’t there alone with this big bags. During the way to the airport pay of the people left and just 3 of us make it to O’hare (including the sleeping guy) I arrived there were cleaners and some other people leaving from other cars and then that was it. (I counted people sleeping on the train cause I had to walk and there were just like 7 on the whole train)


Look, once again it was my experience and I think I was lucky I didn’t go through anything weird or crazy people, I honestly wasn’t really afraid of getting killed or mugged cause as I said when I placed the question I really don’t think it is that frequent that something like that happens, I know it does exceptional times but it’s not the rule. The time I’ve spent in Chicago I’ve seen crazy things/people on the trains at mostly every hour, and honestly think that there won’t ever be something like 100% guaranteed safety travel, but I also think this is the common rule for almost everywhere around the world, so yes the safest option will always be Uber or similars and if you have that option it’s always better not to risk it, but if you really have to go and do this midnight rides then chances are you gonna be okay, but there will always be the risk, also sadly from past experiences I’ve seen and I think women are more targeted, so it’s always better if you have someone to do this with and not by yourself, I honestly think this will give you a little extra layer of safety. Just always be aware of your surroundings, don’t hesitate to ask for help if it comes to it and if you have the chance to a safer ride always take it. If there’s no other option chances are you’ll be okay, but it’s never 100% guaranteed.

Planning a trip to Chicago but our stay will overlap with the Mexican Independence Day - how much will it interfere with being able to get anywhere Downtown?,"Hello!  My spouse and I are planning on visiting Chicago for the first time in September.  Currently, we are booked at the Hilton Chicago on Michigan Ave. for six nights.  We wanted to stay Downtown since a lot of the sights we are interested in seeing are in the Downtown area, and we are not planning on hassling with renting a car and driving - we plan to walk to where we can, and use Uber/Lyft or possibly public transportation where it might be a bit too far to walk.

We didn’t realize there was a big celebration for the Mexican Independence Day on September 16th until I saw something mentioned about it when I was researching more into things to do while we are there, which falls right smack dab in the middle of our planned trip.  It is my understanding that the actual parades are not in the Downtown area, but that a large amount of cars tend to converge on Downtown streets celebrating and create a lot of gridlock, making it difficult or impossible to get thorough traffic.

What I’m wondering is, how long does the bad traffic in the Downtown area for this holiday typically last?  Does it start the day before (Friday) and extend into Saturday (the actual holiday) and possibly into Sunday too, or is it mostly contained to either the daytime or the evening on Saturday?  I’m thinking we probably won’t want to plan on doing anything that requires traveling by Uber/Lyft when this is going on, or anything time sensitive like dinner reservations.  But will we be able to get anywhere on foot during this time, or will there be large crowds of people jamming the sidewalks, too, and does it tend to get rough?  Should we just plan to stay in our hotel until things calm down?  My spouse typically does not do well in large mass crowds, so if it’s mainly just cars blocking the streets but not people crowding the sidewalks and we’re on foot, he’ll likely be okay, but if it’s like a massive sea of people standing around making it difficult to walk anywhere, we’ll definitely want to stay in.

Since we’ll be there for several days total, I can deal with hanging around the hotel for part of a day or evening to avoid the pandemonium.  But, I don’t want to miss an entire day or more of not being able to get out and about.   If that’s the case, we might change our plans and try to plan a visit some other time (we can cancel our hotel reservation if need be, though I’d hate to as we’ve been looking forward to visiting Chicago for a long time).

I went to a sex club for the first time and experienced matriarchy.,"*EDIT: Hey guys, I can't keep up with all the questions here or in my inbox, so I'm gonna have to tap out. The answers to most of your questions are in the comments, if you look through. If you're looking for a similar club in your area, just do your due diligence and ask around online about it, not all clubs are the same. And don't forget, even in very safe and well-maintained spaces, bad apples can slip through, so please be smart and have fun!*

OK, the title is a bit of a joke. But honestly, the gender dynamics of the space were so different I found it fascinating, and I wanted to write about it.

There will be no sexy details in this post (sorry, pervert guys who will inevitably DM me later. I'm just gonna block). I'm genuinely just really interested in the social space and the culture that developed in the sex club.

I should clarify, i've only been to this one particular club, different clubs may have different cultures. This one is a particularly social space - no loud, pounding music, there's a heated pool where people hang out, and an upstairs area where most of the sex happens, so the sex and the socializing are mostly separated. I've heard it described as a ""social club first, sex club second"". I'm not going to name the club, since I don't represent them. These are just my own thoughts and observations.

I decided to go on my own, partly because I was curious and wanted to challenge myself, but also because at the time I couldn't imagine anything more awkward than taking a friend with me to the sex club (I have since taken several friends with me to the sex club and it's fine.) I promised myself that I would just go there once, as a challenge, and I would leave immediately if I felt unsafe or uncomfortable.

I thought of the sexual politics of a dance club - guys going out to get laid, and then groping, following, pressuring, and generally bullying the women they found there. Bouncers that intervened only in the most obvious and egregious circumstances. Closely guarding my drink and monitoring my girl friends' safety. Despite all the marketing advertising a safe, consent-first space, I just couldn't picture it. How could the presence of sex and nudity produce BETTER behaviour in men? Hard to believe. So I assumed I would be there for an hour tops, check it off the bucket list, and go home.

Instead what i discovered was, when you're a single woman at a sex club, you're basically royalty. Every rule and custom revolves around what women want. For example:

\- Men are not allowed upstairs (where most of the sex happens) without a female escort. Two nights a week, men are not even allowed in the club without a female escort. If your date leaves, and there's no woman there who will agree to stay with you, you have to leave. Women can go when and where they please.  
\-Single women pay a $15 cover. Single men pay $100.  
\- The bouncers and staff are on the BALL when it comes to women's safety. I once stumbled a little bit getting out of the pool, and security was INSTANTLY on me.  ""How much have you had to drink? Has anybody else been near your drink tonight?"" I was literally just clumsy, but I appreciated the check in. I have NEVER had a bouncer take my safety that seriously at a traditional club.  
\- The ask-once-rule. If you are interested in someone, you can ask them ONLY ONCE to go upstairs with you. If they say no, that's it. No pestering, no following.  
\- No touching of any kind - not so much as a pat on the shoulder - without explicit verbal consent. Even watching/staring at other people requires consent.  
\- If you violate any of these rules, the staff is not shy about not just kicking you out, but banning you for life.

These rules are for everyone, but come on... We know who they were thinking of when they made them.

I cannot emphasize enough how every rule and custom is designed and enforced to protect women and eliminate pushy or violent behaviour in men. As a result, unsafe men are far less likely to get in and stay in. Men who feel entitled to women's bodies and attention quickly find that they spent $100 to get banned from a club. With a price tag that high, they are on their best behaviour, because they know that a few words from me can get them kicked out in an instant.

**In the club, I got to experience something I never had before: what it's like to be in a co-ed space where women's needs are central.**  It makes you really realize how much of your life you spend anticipating male violence, and how that anticipation changes your social behavior. How often we laugh at jokes that aren't funny, don't speak up when we dislike something. How carefully we dance around making sure the men around us feel good about themselves, because we don't know what they will do if they feel ""emasculated"".  We do it even when the men around us seem fine, because it becomes a habit.

**When the threat of violence is removed from the equation, women very naturally take on the socially dominant position**. How could we not? Men want us so much more than we want them. They want our attention. They want to impress us. If men can't threaten and harass and intimidate, (or passively benefit from a culture where OTHER men do so) they have to smile and charm and think hard about what we want and how to give it to us.

Without threatening men around, women relax and open up socially. They take up space. They say what they want. And the men listen. The vibe is absurdly upbeat and positive, and more socially open than a typical bar. At a bar, you mostly talk to the people you came with, unless someone is smooth enough to break the ice. At the sex club, people just... talk to whoever's closest. Everyone always seems in a good mood, everyone seems happy to talk to you.

Here's the kicker: even the MEN seem happier without patriarchal dudes around. In the outside world, men worry they will be perceived as gay if they so much as have a drink with an umbrella in it. In the club, I've seen men stand around, butt-ass naked, chatting happily with each other without a moment's ""no homo"" anxiety. There's much less peacocking, much less jostling with each other to be dominant or ""alpha."" They can just relax. In fact, **I've spoken to many men who will happily spend the $100 with no expectation of getting laid that night. They just enjoy the social space that much.**

I think it's over-idealistic to imply that the dynamics of patriarchy just evaporate when you step into a space like this. But this is the closest thing to a matriarchy I've ever experienced. And as a result, everybody is happy, everybody seems to like each other, there is far less conflict or jostling for dominance, and everybody is having lots and lots of sex.

"As the only woman in a concealed carry class, my experience was alarming…","I live in Florida and with everything happening around the country and in my own community, plus the fact that I’m always out biking on trails, my wife and I decided we wanted to become responsible gun owners for self protection.

(Ex things most women already practice like don’t take a shortcut through a dark ally, walk around the block on a well lit path with other people around…)

Meanwhile every man in that room kept challenging him. They were walking through scenarios that made no sense for using a gun and when he told them they’d be in the wrong, they pushed back with lines like, “that doesn’t sit well with me,” or “I’d never let that happen, guess I’m just a hot head.” This is the guy who would be defending them and he was telling them straight up he couldn’t defend those choices.

He explained castle doctrine and stand your ground laws and reasonable person expectations and proportional force. One example was a road rage situation where someone gets out and starts pounding on your hood. You can’t shoot them. You drive away, call the police, anything but that. You only have the right to use deadly force if they enter your vehicle. The men looked genuinely stunned that the correct move was to drive off instead of opening fire.

Another guy talked about walking past someone who was spitting on the ground towards him and glaring at him. He asked if he could have shot him if things escalated like the man spit on him and they go into a fist fight. The lawyer basically said, why on earth would you walk right up to someone who’s already showing you they’re a threat instead of crossing the street or turning around to avoid it completely.

It was wild. I’m a gay woman who works from home and barely interacts with men outside of work, so sitting there listening to this was jarring. I was trying to learn how to avoid danger and using my firearm, and the men were trying to find loopholes to justify killing someone over petty ego moments. My state has over 2 million concealed carry permits issued AND you no longer have to even have a permit. I hope I somehow just ended up with a group of hot heads and this isn’t the norm for men to look for reasons to shoot someone rather than avoiding them…",TwoXChromosomes,11022,1764002013.0,808,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1p5lqac/as_the_only_woman_in_a_concealed_carry_class_my/
I woke up to someone on top of me 22F,"Repost because the old post was removed due to triggering words. Sorry. 
I slept last night by a friend who I trusted. I woke up to his dick inside me. I haven’t showered and I’ve been questioned by the police. He’s been arrested. He said he was dreaming and didn’t mean to. He said he will kill himself. He said he dreamed of having sex with his ex. I will edit this post with more details. I’m really upset and low on energy at the moment. Support would be greatly appreciated. I don’t think I realised what has happened. I normally push things down and repress them. I just want to move on with my life. 

Edit: thank you for the support. He’s 55 btw. I’ve known him since I was 19. 


Edit 2: I’ve been checked forensically and I’ve been checked over at the hospital and I’ve had a rape kit done. I was too scared he would ask me to shower so I lied and said I was going for a walk. I called the police and hid a few streets away from his house. He kept saying he would drive me home, and to come back it’s not safe outside.

Potato Eating A-Hole,"Let me preface this with A) I (33f) am in my luteal phase so my rage knows no bounds and  B) I know this man's (35m) actions were not malicious, just childishly short sighted and selfish.

Yesterday I spent 2 hours meal prepping an entire bag of Little Duos (about 30 potatoes). I boiled them for 15 minutes, made a garlic, thyme, and rosemary brown butter and meticulously measured out 10 grams of shredded cheese for each potato. I then mashed each potato using the back of a glass to be only about a half to a quarter inch thick, drenched them in the butter sauce and popped them in the oven for an hour to crisp. The house smelled INCREDIBLE.

About 5 of those potatoes couldnt fit on the tray so I decided to eat those un mashed ones with a little smoked fish for dinner.

Once the hour was up, I took them out to cool and then boxed them up and put them in the fridge. I was VERY excited to eat them with lunch the following day and did not have any of the finished product at the time.

My partner is a night worker. I told him what I was making before he left for work, let him know I was meal prepping but told him he could have some (key word SOME) when he got home.

Imagine my surprise when I walk into the goddamn livingroom to see the container where I stored 25 smashed potatoes dirty and empty just... sitting on the coffee table. Not in the sink, not in the dish washer. Sitting proudly in the middle of my livingroom.

I want to cry and commit murder. Money, a grocery trip and 2 hours of my time completely disappeared into the bottomless pit of a stomach my careless and negligent partner possesses.

I feel like I have every right to demand he goes back to the store to re buy every ingredient he horked down but IM ALSO RAGING AND HORMONAL!!!

Goooood, days like these I wish I was an 80 year old woman alone in my home with 10 cats.

And no, I wont be breaking up with him over potatoes but hes not gonna like me when he wakes up.

Edit: For a little clarity, he has never done this before. Normally when I meal prep I pre portion and freeze the portions. I will also leave a container unfrozen in the fridge for him to pick through. This time I didnt freeze them as potatoes freeze like grainy bricks of sadness nor did I pre portion as my fridge is teeny and didnt have enough room. I didn't think I would have to tell him not to eat 20 to 25 mini potatoes (cuz who eats that many in one sitting!?) but obviously I should have!

UPDATE:

He is awake and aware of his fuck-up. He was extremely apologetic and will be buying me replacement ingredients and will be making them with me this weekend. He genuinely believed that my container of 20+ taters were ment for him. I pray for his collon.",TwoXChromosomes,2314,1770133824.0,348,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1quvipj/potato_eating_ahole/
"I got into a stranger’s car. I feel ashamed, unsafe, and I don’t understand why I did it.","I’m someone (25F) who mostly keeps to myself. I dress masculine, walk fast, usually look angry, and I’ve /never/ been bothered by men, even walking at night. I think I gave myself a false sense of security because of how I present.

I don’t drive. I walk everywhere, and the other day I was heading home from the supermarket. I had my headphones on but music low enough to still hear traffic.

I was on a quiet road when a car pulled up beside me. A man inside said something- I thought I heard “directions” so I took one headphone off and said, “Pardon?”
He shook his head and waved his hand, and I SHOULD have kept walking.
But I asked again, “Sorry, do you need help?”
He replied that he thought I was someone else, so I gave a polite “Oh, no worries” and started walking again, but then noticed the car was still slowly following me.

I took my headphones off again. He was talking to me, seemed drunk, and said something like:

“Can you PLEASE show me there’s still trust in the world and let me drive you home?”

I refused, as gently as I could, not wanting to escalate anything. But he kept asking. He was driving slowly beside me, pleading.

Another car pulled into the road behind him, so he finally drove forward, I thought “thank fuck that’s over with”.
But moments later, I saw him circle back through a side road and pull up beside me again.
This time, he tried to convince me by telling me where he worked, his full name, said he had a 14-year-old daughter, that he’s had a hard time, and just needed “someone to trust him.” He offered to show me his ID.
For some stupid reason, I stepped toward the car to see the ID. The moment I did, he said “Thank you so much!” and opened the door.

And for some reason I cannot fathom, I got in.

I can’t explain it. I felt pressured. Caught off guard. Like I’d already committed to something just by not walking away sooner.

Once in the car, he said, “You shouldn’t have done that. I have a 14-year-old daughter.”
He told me his mother had died the day before.
He was driving fast. At one point he said, “I bet you thought I was going to rape you.”
I panicked internally but felt like I had to laugh off his jokes and tread carefully.

Luckily, truly by the grace of the universe, roadworks blocked the street and forced him to reroute. I said I lived just around the corner and that here was fine. He protested, made some creepy joke about “taking me where he’d planned all along,” but eventually pulled into a side road and let me out.
I walked home, constantly looking over my shoulder.

But now I’m left reeling.
I feel ashamed. I don’t understand why I got in that car.
I convinced myself I’d never be in a situation like this “I don’t dress feminine, I keep to myself, I don’t entertain men.”

I still don’t understand why I got in that car.
I’ve always believed I wouldn’t fall for something like this. I feel ashamed and stupid.
I told some close friends afterwards and they all said what I was already thinking: That was stupid.
And they’re not wrong. I would’ve said the same thing, too.

But I can’t even follow my own thought process. I don’t know what part of me thought getting in was the right move, or even a neutral one. It’s shaken me. I feel less safe now than I have in a long time.

I just needed to tell someone. If anyone’s been through something like this, I’d appreciate hearing it.",TwoXChromosomes,5028,1754294325.0,418,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mh7fpl/i_got_into_a_strangers_car_i_feel_ashamed_unsafe/
Yesterday a bigot confused me for a trans woman,"I want to start this off as I respect and see all of my trans women out there as fully women, hard stop. 
This is just me emotionally dumping something that happened yesterday that hurt me.
**Edit:I opened the post this way because I wrote negative trans hate words in this post that were used to refer to me and I wanted to make it clear that those aren't my feelings but the feelings of a lunatic who harassed me. 


Yesterday was my day off and I had to go into work for an hour to get no showed by an interviewee. I figured since I was out and wanted to feel productive I would get my grocery shopping done while I was out. 


I got to the store, sat in my car for a bit and noticed a woman standing next to the cart corral. She looked normal enough and looked like she was talking on the phone via an ear bud. Didn't think much of it, got out of my car and she grinned ear to ear at me so I gave smile back and she let out to her friend on the phone, ""oh my God it's one of those T-slur"" 
I was taken aback still not even thinking she was talking about me, went into the store to get my shopping done. 
This woman followed me around the store at just enough distance that I assumed she was just shopping. She had a cart and everything. Every so often I would hear her say, ""ya you know that their a T-slur cause I'm on the hill"" ""fucking gross ass T-slur I know you're a fucking man"" 


She followed me around the whole store stopping just far enough away to have plausible deniably that she wasn't talking about me until we ended up in the same aisle facing each other, she pointed at me laughed and said, ""I know you're a fucking T-slur""
I know I should have spoken up, I should have just left but I was so taken aback that I felt frozen. 
I got to the check out and was so thankful someone quickly got in line behind me. She circled around like a vulture. I walked outside and saw some charity workers. I stopped to talk to them hoping she would leave me alone. 30 minutes of talking to the charity workers she finally left, I made a donation and went to my car. She didn't even buy anything. Does she just go to grocery stores to harass people. 
I got on my car and cried. 
This woman, a complete stranger decided that because I am taller than average and built broadly that I was a man. She decided to spit hate at me, she found a huge insecurity of mine just from her bigotry of thinking I'm trans. 
I'm still hurt and feel like I shouldn't feel hurt as this is not even a drop in the bucket that trans women actually go through. 
I don't know what I want from posting here, just to scream into the void that I really dislike humanity sometimes. 
And fuck that lady. ",TwoXChromosomes,7474,1727404502.0,577,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1fqdog6/yesterday_a_bigot_confused_me_for_a_trans_woman/
"I'm being ""transvestigated"" and it sucks","Let me just start my little rant by saying that I'm aware that everything I'm experiencing is 100% worse and more unsafe for actual trans women. It still sucks though. 

For the last year, I've been ""transvestigated"" by a number of people. I'm an AFAB femme ... person (?) and I'm currently reevaluating what my gender identity feels like and means to me, so it feels extra sucky. Like I don't even have the space to figure this shit out for myself.  

I'm pretty short, pretty curvy, and ridiculously soft looking. Like, I have a medical condition that straight up looks like someone manually softened my features in photoshop, and that same condition makes it hard to gain muscle. 

There's at least two established friend groups/campaigns at my college dedicated to my perceived transness, and the reach of that rumor on campus is *vast*. Pretty mcuh everyone I meet for the first time that's already aware of me has heard about it, and wholeheartedly believes it to be true. It's gone so far as to reach the school's medical services, who changed my gender markers based on what they heard. Thanks guys, totally professional. My partner works in the community, and the rumor has even made it to people he works with. (I have a pretty visible job, and there's a lot of overlap in community politics and our school community so it's not surprising, just obnoxious.)

But it's not just weirdos on campus. I've been followed into bathrooms. I've been harrassed on the street. Some dude followed me through the grocery store a few weeks ago, preaching to me about my transness. Because the campus system 'talks' to other medical systems, I have to talk to every. new. doctor. I see about it. Last night some woman called me ""sir"" when I held the door for her, and when I politely said ""oh, of course, but it's miss"" she came back into the story to argue about with me about it. (Fuck you lady, I don't want to even be called ""miss,"" but there's no gender neutral equivalent I know of.) I was in a fucking sundress. 

I'm just so tired of this crap. 

EDIT: holy shit, this blew up. I really appreciate all the support and advice. I'm gonna respond to some common questions/comments up here since there's there's a lot of comments and I fell asleep so I didn't monitor them very well. I'm gonna be kind of scant with detail bc I'm honestly afraid of certain people finding this post. 


some general context: I'm in the US (Montana), and I go to a fairly small school. I'm somewhat well-known on campus because I used to work multiple public facing jobs; harassment campaigns, including this one, are why I no longer do them. 

The gender identifiers that were changed in my medical records are supposed to be self-reported, and I'm unsure if they can even be accessed by medical staff or if they have a log of changes. It's possible that my account was hacked, but I haven't noticed any other changes. 

I haven't reported my harassment because I'm honestly not sure I'll be believed or taken seriously. I've faced harassment campaigns before, from some of the same people; when I tried to take action previously, I was told by school administration that they can't do shit without a paper trail, and that life is full of he-said-she-said stuff, so I'm not optimistic. I have no proof other than word of mouth, and the handful of people I know for sure are involved are very good at the metaphorical ""I'm not touching you"" aspect of bullying. As far as the administration is concerned, what's happening to me isn't very nice, but it's neither a serious concern nor a conduct issue. 

The people I know to be involved include are mainly a guy I rejected three years ago and his friends. They have been publicly called out for other types of harassment against other students by our student government, but denied knowing each other. I know this to be false, as my partner used to be in an unregistered club with them. 

I cannot seek help from the school newspaper, as unfortunately some of the staff is involved in spreading rumors. This also cannot be proven with a paper trail and is purely word of mouth.

Best response to All Men/Not All Men debate,"I heard this response from a man, discussing why women say All Men.

He said,

""You've been around guns, right? What's the first thing they teach you about guns? Always assume they are loaded, even if you know it's not. You cannot tell if a gun is loaded just by looking at it.

It's the same with women. They cannot tell if a man is going to explode on her just by looking at him, so she must treat every man as if he is.""

Definitely my favorite way to respond to the NOT ALL MEN response.

Edit: To clarify, I do not agree that all men are rapists, murderers, etc. I do believe women have the right to take precautions and protect themselves from the potential of something going wrong.

People are saying this can be used to give racists the green light, I say anything can be manipulated into a racist analogy, but racists never paid attention to red lights anyway.

FOR ME, I say

If you (M or F) were in a bad part of town alone and you saw guys walking your way, MOST LIKELY you would take precautions like moved to other side of the street, use your phone to let someone know where you are, etc. With some men, if women use precautions on a date, they are harassed and called paranoid or hysterical.

It is for those men that this is a response. The men that trivialize the fear and precautions women live with daily.",TwoXChromosomes,1521,1767979403.0,284,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1q8edd5/best_response_to_all_mennot_all_men_debate/
“Women live life on easy mode”,"Every time I hear some dude whine about how “women have it so easy”, because we get “free drinks” or “attention” or “sympathy”, I want to scream. Like, what planet are you living on, my guy? You think being harassed by randoms since puberty, being afraid to walk alone at night, being talked over in meetings, judged for aging, having our health issues ignored by doctors, and being paid less for the same work is easy?

You think fighting tooth and nail to be taken seriously in male-dominated fields, being shamed for not having kids or for having too many, and constantly being sexualized by media and society is some kind of cheat code?

You think it’s easy when your safety, autonomy, and bodily rights are still up for debate in 2025?

Meanwhile, men can coast through half of life with zero pressure to look young, marry early, or even communicate their emotions like adults. You don’t get blamed for being assaulted. You’re not expected to “keep the peace” at your own expense. You don’t lose career momentum because of pregnancy, childcare, or being deemed “too emotional.”

The truth is: society is set up to benefit men by default. And the ones crying “easy mode” usually haven’t even tried playing life outside their gendered privilege sandbox.",TwoXChromosomes,2972,1752128023.0,339,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1lw5gac/women_live_life_on_easy_mode/
I had a miscarriage on Wednesday. A pharmacist in MO refused to fill my medication.,"This week has been the hardest week of my life and I am not one to want to share these things, but I believe too many people are ignorant about what going through a miscarriage is actually like (including myself before this week).

My husband and I have been trying for a baby for almost a year. I had made so many life style changes, started reading baby books, was taking my prenatal vitamins, and already seeing a physician about possible fertility issue just in case. Finally, on June 4th, I had a positive pregnancy test. My husband and I both cried, it was probably the best day of our lives.

We were overzealous and though we knew miscarriage was an option, you can't convince yourself it will happen to you. We started preparing immediately, buying baby stuff, making lists, and I had a dr's appointment and my first ultrasound scheduled within days.

On Wednesday, my baby was supposed to be 9 weeks and 3 days. We went to the ultrasound and there my baby was. It was there and everything I wanted. Even though I could see it, and it seemed so perfect, I felt in my gut something was wrong because the ultrasound tech was quiet. The silence was deafening and I was convincing myself she was quiet because she wasn't the Dr and wasn't allowed to talk about it. After what felt like 10-15 minutes of pictures, she pulled the ultrasound back to my baby and zoomed back in. She started talking finally. ""And there's your baby, there's the yolk, and the sac... I am so sorry but there is no heartbeat.""

She just sat there, with my baby on the screen, the probe still in my vagina, as I cried and all my husband could do is grab my leg. Eventually she pulled it out and told me she would be back with a Dr. We sat in there for twenty minutes, crying. I spiraled through all the emotions possible grief, anger, fear, guilt, and denial. I almost convinced myself that once the Dr saw the pictures he would know the baby was fine, and the technician was wrong.

The Dr came in and confirmed the baby was not viable. They are able to tell in two ways, one by some measurement (I cannot remember what it was) and by not having a heartbeat. My baby was not viable for both reasons.

The Dr talked with us for a long time and was very kind, but it was so confusing and hard. Miscarriage is confusing and not enough people talk about it. He told me I had a few options: 1) wait to see if my body miscarries by itself. I was not showing signs of miscarriage, and my baby was still there. He said this could take weeks and if the process begins it can take weeks. He said if I do this, I need to monitor for heavy bleeding, extreme pain/cramping, fevers, shortness of breath, and chills. I asked, well isn't miscarrying going to produce heavy bleeding and extreme cramping? His answer was yes. Then how do I know if I need to go to the emergency room? He said well go if you think you need to. If my body did not miscarry itself, I could get sick from sepsis and would put myself at risk and possibly need more emergent care. 2) Take a medical intervention (misoprostol). This will cause the miscarriage and most of it will be done between 24 and 48 hours. 3) Do a D&amp;C, a surgical procedure to remove all the tissue.

The Dr. scheduled me an appointment for the very next day to figure out what we wanted to do. The next day I was with a new Dr to me, but a Dr they specifically chosen because she had dealt with this with patients before and she told me she has went through it herself. Wednesday night, I had extremely cramping and heavy bleeding. I believed this was likely my miscarriage, and it had happened naturally. I told the Dr what had happened, and again realized I knew nothing about miscarriages. She said it could have been. It could have been some of it, could have been none of it. She said I still had the option to wait it out naturally, but again this could lead to it's own risks. We talked through all the options again, and my husband and I agreed the misoprostol was the best option. This way we would know it was done and wouldn't have to live in fear waiting. And to be honest, I couldn't live with knowing my dead baby was inside me any longer.

These are abortion pills. These are what you take when you need an abortion. Let me tell you why I fucking know first hand why no one uses this shit was birth control. I was so scared to take these pills. ""Expect extreme cramping and bleeding, but also go to the emergency room if you have extreme cramping and bleeding."" It was all so confusing. ""Be warry of fevers, chills, shortness of breath, dizziness."" Expect extreme pain, but just rotate between over the counter Tylenol and ibuprofen. Know this could go on for up to 48 hours. Stay home.

And at the end she said ""When you go to the pharmacy, they are going to ask if you are pregnant. If you say yes, they will not give them to you. Tell them instead you are having an active miscarriage"".

Our hell wasn't over. Now we get to go to a Walgreens pharmacy and have to be asked an intrusive question and answer it in front of everyone. You ever been to a Walgreen's pharmacy???????? There is no fucking privacy.  I already had a pit in my gut, I am in Missouri, I was ready for the judgement.

I went to the Walgreen's pharmacy attached to the medical center I was at. I thought it would be safe and they would be the most understanding. And they were... but they did haven't the prescription. She told me she could order it for tomorrow (Friday). My husband had to leave for work on Saturday and I didn't want to be going through this alone, so I told her I needed it today. She told me to try another Walgreens.

We went to the next Walgreens. I asked the technician to check if they had it before they filled it, because I needed it today. She checked and said it was available and they would get it filled. I felt some relief and was ready to get this one nightmare over with and start the next. Then she came out, and she said she was so sorry but the pharmacist refused to fill it.

The pharmacist refused to fill it. It hadn't clicked in my head what was going on, I asked why, she said he said the ""dose was too high"". I gave them my medical paper work (I was not thinking, I just was panicked and wanted this over with). She gave it back to him and came back and just said he refused to fill it. That's it. I asked what I can do, what I need to do. She said she didn't know, there was nothing.

To be honest, I cursed and I cried. I am embarrassed but have I not fucking been through enough? have I not fucking suffered enough? My husband and I went back to the car and we called the original pharmacy, I was crying and yelling and they were so nice. They worked to figure out what they could do for me, and they ended up being able to fill it by giving me a shit ton of lower dosage pills. Thank you to those brilliant angels that went out of their way because they realized how much I needed just some fucking human decency.

I bled a lot on the pills. I cramped a lot and it hurt. I cried a lot and I miss my baby.

And then Friday I was told Roe vs Wade was gone. And I have heard so many people over and over again say this won't hurt women who are having miscarriages and how we are overreacting.

I can tell you right now, the day before it was even gone, that I was denied my medication I needed for my miscarriage. I was denied it in Missouri by a male pharmacist. Right now, it hurts too much, but I am going to call and get his name and file a formal complaint, but this will not end. This will get worse.

I am so scared to have a baby now. This process hurt so much and was so evil and such a fucking nightmare. And now it will be worse. I am so scared of how I will be treated if this happens again. We don't deserve this, no one deserves this.

I was always pro-choice because it's none of my damn business what other women do with their bodies. But I wanted to share my story, because so many people keeping fucking spouting how this won't affect women who have miscarriages.

FUCK YOU to every single one of those people.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I want to say thank you for everyone's kindness. After this situation and then all the Roe vs Wade discussion right afterwards, I was feeling very negative, helpless, and alone. This has made me feel much stronger, more hopeful, and now angry.

My details for the complaint and others to avoid this Walgreens

Address:  330 SW Ward Rd, Lee's Summit, MO 64081

Time: June 23, 2022 at \~4:10 PM

There was only one pharmacist on staff at this time from my knowledge. With these details, Walgreens will know who the person was and I will not have to share a name.

The entire situation:

\- Called them on our way to their location at 3:58 PM, the technician that answered kept getting our last name spelt wrong and would not answer if they could fill it today.

\- Arrive there around 6-8 minutes later, gave details to technician at the counter and asked if she could see if they could fill it today.

\- Technician checked and said yes it was available and went to process the medication.

\- We waited at the chairs in the lobby. The technician came out and said the pharmacist refused to fill the medication, the dosage was too high. I asked what we could do, she said he called our original Walgreens pharmacy (the one that did not have the specific dosage I needed on hand) and they did not answer (WE WILL GET BACK TO THIS). I asked if we could call our physician. She did not respond.

\- THE DOSAGE WAS FOR 600 MICROGRAMS OF MISOPROSTOL EVERY 6 HOURS FOR 24 HOURS. YOU CAN EASILY GOOGLE THIS IS ACTUALLY ON THE LOWER END OF DOSAGES FOR MISCARRIAGE.

\- Gave the technician my paperwork to give to the pharmacist (I should not have done this, but was panicked and did not know what to do)

\- She took it back to him, came back and just said he would not fill it.

\- Asked what I can do? Can I call my physician? What if I call the other pharmacy?

\- She did not respond or give any advice.

\- The pharmacist NEVER CAME TO SPEAK TO ME. Never.

\- I cried and cursed. Sorry to the technician, but no one would help me or give me any information.

\- Left and went to my car. Immediately called the original Walgreens pharmacy. They answered immediately and said they never received a call.

We are in the same team, so we ended up sharing an office and we've spent a lot of time together, supported each other etc. Already from the get go, I didn't know how to handle him. He's very outgoing, extroverted, funny and intimate in his ways. He will touch your arm when he is talking to you, give you compliments and call you señorita or habibti. He will hold up doors and pull out chairs and make grand gestures around it. He is like a parody of a Don Juan, and at the beginning I thought it was all an act because who acts like that for real? At a workplace? Then I started to brush it off as a culture clash thing that I'm just not used to, since he's from another country. I just laughed and shook my head when it became too much, because I couldn't take it seriously. 

But then things have escalated. He confided in me that his marriage is off the rails and they have three kids under 6. His wife and him are not talking at all. He told me I was his only friend, the only one who understands him. Ugh dude, I had known him for a week! It put me in a strange position. 

The other thing that happened that made things escalate, was when I was holding up an elevator door for him and jokingly said ""ladies first"" to which he entered and then realised what I've said. I got into the elevator too and we laughed about it and then he put his hand around my neck, pulled me in, and gave me a kiss on the forehead. There was no time to react, I still had a grin stuck on my face from before and it was over in one second. After that he proceeded to get more intimate, rubbing my shoulders, pulling me in for hugs and not letting go, stuff like that. I sat down to talk with him and told him it's too much and he's acting unprofessional and he can't touch me like that. I thought I reached him. 

I haven't seen him for two weeks since we've been off doing an introduction course, but now we have reunited for a conference out of town with 6 other co workers. Yesterday evening, he invited me up his room and I was trying to get out of it, but I felt like I couldn't. He put on the tv and lied down on the bed and I made sure to stay on the couch. He asked me twice to lie next to him, I refused. Then he got up and picked me up from the sofa so my feet weren't touching the ground and squeezed me tight. Started swirling me around like we were dancing. I told him to put me down and that I was going to bed. When I went for the door, he walked up to me, held me tight and whispered into my ear ""stay a little"". I managed to get free. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. 

Now I'm lying in the dark, panicking. We are stuck here for three more days. I don't know my other co workers that well, there's no one I can talk to. And after these three days, I'm gonna spend 3 hours next to him on a train back home and then we are back to office on Monday. I don't know what to do. 


 EDIT:

I went to work and the post blew up during the day. I'm sorry I can't read all comments now, but thank you to all who have reached out and supported me, especially to those who have reached out to me with stories of their own, with care for my safety and wellbeing. You helped me realise that this is indeed sexual harassment, nothing else. You are all so brave and I appreciate your wish to help a stranger in need. To those who have written to me to tell me how valuable kindness is - an extra thank you. It meant a lot to hear. Being kind is in my nature, and I don't want a douchebag to take that away from me. But I will 100 % work on being less accommodating, and that is probably a more accurate word to describe my actions in this situation than kindness. 

I can see that my post has annoyed some people. Some comments have been harsh, even to the point of victim blaming, but your message has come across: I need to work on being more firm with my boundaries and build my own self respect. I should have done more sooner, I am self critical of that, but I need to focus on what lies ahead. After all, we are gonna work closely together for years to come. Something else worth mentioning is that I only have a probationary employment so far. I don't want this mess, keeping this job is essential. 

There are a couple of things people have asked that I want to address:

Why did I go to his room? There are a few explanations:
1. He is my office roomie back home. I've spent many hours alone with him and somewhere I was hoping that he'd still respect me as a colleague and that going to his hotel room wouldn't mean entering the lion's cave. 
2. I had already spent the entire afternoon with him yesterday, including the 3 hour train ride, and he had behaved completely normal. He acted the same way when we were alone in the lobby. Plus we had just been away from each other for two weeks during the course and it felt good then.
3. I had just arrived at the lobby to hang out with the co workers, and a minute after I got there, they all said goodnight and went to their rooms. Only me and him were left behind and it was a little awkward.  He asked me: “What do we do now…? I can show you my room?”
“No… I think I'm just gonna…”
“What are you talking about, you just got here! What else were you going to do?” to which I didn't know what to respond. As a friend put it, it's hard to say no to a person who only wants to hear a yes. I didn't feel like I had an option. But I was cautious given the history and the change of setting. I was gonna make sure to put a lot of space between us and leave if he tried anything. And I stuck with my plan. And I'm proud of myself for that.


So how did today go?
It's been a rather anxious day and I've tried my best to avoid him. I think he is aware that he has messed up because he has given me space and hasn't attempted to approach me. I have made sure to not be alone with him and my main focus now is to get through the week and get home safe. If he touches me again, I will tell him firmly never to do it again or I will take matters further. I've confided in a colleague back home too. Thanks again for your support.

The art of throwing a tantrum instead of doing household chores and the audacity to think that women dream of living with a man they have to parent,"I don't know what it is about some men who think ""I'm such a catch! All I have to do is exist and be nice when things are good between us and she'll love me forever"". 

The idea of both of us working full time, splitting bills yet me having to do 80% of the household chores the other 20% being him just doing the dishes after I cook (and just recently after living together for 18 months that he does the dishes in a timely manner without me having to ask) doesn't seem appealing at all to me. 

I explained to him I cleaned the shower last week, when it was his month to do it, with hot water. He proceeded to say: you don't pour hot water in the shower. And I said ummm I used hot water from the shower? And he was like ""oh well I thought you meant boiling"". And I said ""Did I say boiling? No I did not"" and we went back and forth for a bit and ooh here we go, figthing over something that he chose to not understand instead of saying ""I'm sorry I didn't clean it, I'll do it this week"" or something like that. He gets so irritated when I get angry at him. He doesn't allow me to me angry because he thinks he's perfect and how dare I call him out on something. 

I said: if you're not happy with how I clean it, DO IT YOURSELF. The audacity to come and correct me on something when it was you that was meant to do it. He said: I'm just teaching you, you don't pour boiling water in the shower. And I said: you're teaching me on something I didn't do?! I didn't put boiling water dude so what are you teaching me on?!

 And then he goes about how I'm being condescending by saying that hot and boiling are not the same. 

This happens a l l t h e t i m e I bring up something. He manages to find a word I say to argue about that and, surprise surprise, we're no longer talking about the issue I initially brought up. I'm also not a native English speaker despite speaking it very well, which sometimes leads me to think he's also nagging me for my speech. Which doesn't impact me because I know I speak well, he's just being obtuse. 

Something just changed in me because I realized I do not want to spend the rest of my life being nitpicked over small words and then yelled at for asking him to do his chores. We've been living together for 2 years, I've made a chores list 5 months ago because this almost 30yo man couldn't look around and see what needs to be done, and even with the chores list, he ""forgets"" to do it. Or, is too tired to do, or doesn't have time to do it. 

He slams the counter and yells ""I've had a shit day, I want to relax and not be told what to do""

I just roll my eyes and say ""oh here we go, another tantrum to avoid being an adult"". This is what he does. Every time I've tried to ask him to do chores, he throws a tantrum. The chores never get done. I can count on *one hand* how many times he has vacuumed in 2 years of living together. 

He games over 20 hours per week and denies it. He gets angry when I tell him to game less and spend more time with me or do the chores. He says ""that's just how he is and that maybe we're just not compatible"". Like ok hunny, good luck finding a compatible woman who will want to date a man child like you. Go off. 

  
I've simply had enough, I've come to realise what am I even getting from this relationship besides a few good moments when things are good between us? I never get taken on dates, he claims he doesn't have money to buy me flowers but spends over 200 on cigarettes every month. Can't even set aside a little bit of money to get me a fucking rose. The only good times we have is when ""things are good between us"". When they're not, he will go 2-3 days without talking to me and ignoring my existence, and I do the same because when I've tried to reach out in the past, he just stone walls me. He has never, not once in almost 3 years, be the first to come and talk and apologize. I used to do it because I'd get scared of us not talking, but now? I feel at peace. He uses his absence as a punishment and now I see him as someone who is so pathetic to think he's such a catch that I'm gonna waste my precious time begging for his attention. 

A few weekends ago, he went on a friends' trip, and I swear it was the best weekend I had in a long time. I got to spend time alone, enjoy the beach, get a massage, see friends and just feel peace that there wasn't someone in the other room yelling at their computer or avoiding wiping the sticky oven top like the plague. 

I have started to imagine what it would be like to live alone and crave it. He still thinks he's a catch though. He still thinks that he's the prize. Just last night, before the argument, we ordered pizza and after the argument he was going on about how he's gonna leave me to eat alone. He said: ""fine then, I'll just leave the house, get fucked, eat by yourself. Every time we argue he's like ""fine then, we should break up"" ""fine then, I'm gonna break our lease and move out"". I used to get so anxious and scared of losing him and now I'm just like ""my GOD, please, do go!!!"". I don't understand what these men think they are the prize for existing and that just around the corner the perfect woman will appear. We want peace and stability, not someone who's gonna avoid issues and then give you the cold shoulder for daring to bring an issue up. It's laughable that they think they're winning. You're doing nothing but actually pushing me so away that the idea of being with you makes my stomach turn.

I can’t use DoorDash anymore.,"2nd UPDATE:
DoorDash has informed me that the person who owned that account has been banned from the platform. 

UPDATE:
I didn’t expect this outpouring of responses, but I’m even more horrified to learn that my experience with delivery services isn’t a unique one. I’m frustrated by the lengths that we have to go to in order to keep ourselves safe that were suggested here (using a masculine name, keeping men’s clothes in my apartment, etc). 

I contacted DoorDash last night after this happened. Since then, I’ve emailed with someone from community response team, who had this response below:

“This sounds like it was a frightening incident and we appreciate you alerting us of this in such detail. This sort of behavior is a violation of our Community Guidelines and something we do not tolerate here at DoorDash. We want to assure you that we have investigated this incident and taken immediate and appropriate action by removing them from receiving any of your future deliveries to ensure the continued safety of our community.” 

I asked for clarification, but it sounds like DoorDash has not removed the account the Dasher was using, only blocked the Dasher’s account from picking up any of my future orders. I’m really disappointed, but not shocked, that more isn’t being done about this issue. 

Most businesses and roads are shut down due to the winter weather, so I will be checking with them tomorrow (if the weather has cleared) for security camera footage of the parking lot.

Original Post:

Ordered DoorDash as a part of my company’s dinner policy tonight. I’ve done this many times and never had a driver have issues parking in the public garage of my apartment lot or get lost. The apartment complex has large, lit signs and clear arrows pointing into the parking lot off of a major road. Both Google and Apple Maps will route you there correctly and the garage is well lit and equipped with cameras. I’ve never felt unsafe meeting someone here. 

My dasher, “Jessica” texted me that she was in the parking lot for businesses next door, to come quickly because it’s cold, and that she had my food ready. I jogged over to the parking lot with my boyfriend and it was pitch dark, except for the car’s headlights being on.

We came around the side of the car and saw there was a man in the driver’s seat, alone, with his pants down. He quickly pulled up his pants in the driver’s seat and threw our order at us before peeling out of the parking lot. 

My name is very clearly feminine on my account. The Dasher also had a very clearly feminine name. I didn’t mention that someone was coming with me to get my food. The Dasher asked me to meet them in a dark, odd place. I keep trying to think of ways that I might have misconstrued this situation in my head, but I think something bad would’ve happened if my boyfriend hadn’t come with me. 

I’ve escalated this to DoorDash and they’re supposed to call me later. I feel sick to my stomach about what could’ve happened and I hope this helps warn other people.",TwoXChromosomes,19251,1675132159.0,880,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/10plndg/i_cant_use_doordash_anymore/
"He flipped on me, left me alone in the woods, and is now trying to apologize.","Long long story as short as I can make it:

We went camping. It has been a long since I could. I was so excited. Had everything packed- even meal prepped food for dinner so it was easy to warm up if we had a few too many. Well.... he did. And it got ugly. 

I fell asleep in my hammock around 3. We had a plan- make dinner at 5, then go get more wood bc we were almost out. When I laid down he said he was going to forage for dead wood.  Great. 

I wake up at 5 and there's this HUUUGE fire he built. All proud with a puffed up chest he's like,  ""see all I gathered?"" I look at the ground and there's nothing. I ask if everything on the fire is what he found and he says yes.  Wtf? I tell him I can't put a grate over that (3 feet high with logs that hang over the side with 12 foot flames) and he LOSES IT. 

Decides to leave, angry.  Only thing I said was ""who does this?!"" as he's busy tearing up the tent to get his shit. He dumps the one cooler he owned onto the ground and straight up LEFT ME THERE.  No car,  no light (he took them out of malicious intent) and my phone was dead on a non electric site. It was getting dark so I had to scurry and get the food I could fit into my cooler before the animals came out. Jar of pickles shattered.  Put the dry food (bread,  chips, etc) into my tent.  Dark came quickly.

I was surrounded until dawn by a dozen raccoons and they weren't playing.  Standing on their back legs,  hissing at me,  lunging for my feet.  I ended up back to a tree fighting those fuckers all night with a stick on fire. There are bears in those woods and that's my biggest phobia. I was terrified. Crying and panicking,  I heard a growl in the woods.  I just stood there frozen,  I was so damn scared ya'll. 

This son of a cunt tried to show up at 7am the next day telling me,  ""if you apologize for the mean way you treated me I'll take you home. ""  BITCH NOW THAT THE DAY BROKE YOU WANNA HELP?! I told that bastard to kick rocks and waited for my mom to come around noon.  I left the site with 2 days paid still on it. Wasnt going to fight those fucks again. And fuck that bear I heard. 

I have completely cut contact with him but he owes me money.  I do have a bunch of his expensive disc golf bullshit that he left here- which he's not getting until he pays me back. Petty or not,  I spent like 600 bucks on everything to do with this trip and he paid zero bc he lost his job. I was just trying to do something nice for him bc I badly wanted to go. Instead I get left in the dark with no communication device, no light, and have to fight off wild animals. No asshole, you can't come sweeping in and fix it. This will never be fixable. 

Sorry for the rant but I didn't know where else to post this.  fuck that dude.


Edit: I've called the police on him and his officer.

I just had the most bone chilling experience in a women's bathroom,"EDIT: thank you sooo much for all the support! It's nice to hear I'm not alone in my experience, but also depressing to see how many of you have had these awful situations happen to you. Thank you for recommending The Gift of Fear, I'll make sure to read it! ❤️

It's the next day, and I can think back to the ordeal. Here's some factors I think could've triggered my suspicion: the doors were very heavy to open, harder to exit. There were no cameras on the outside of the structure. The stop only had three vehicles, all parked and dark inside. Nobody exited afterwards. Regarding it just being someone pooping; I'd totally get that, seeing as I myself am so shy about it that I'd rather hold it in the entire day &amp; wait to get home than to do it in a public bathroom. But the stall was *quiet*, zero sounds. I know I prefer to make some kind of noise if someone else enters the bathrooms, be it a soft cough, sniffling my nose, shuffling my feet, etc. The first sound I heard was when my tap water started – no toilet flushing, no readjusting of clothes, no body movement, just the clank of the metal lock unlocking.

If it was just an innocent bystander; great, no harm done, worst case we spooked each other. If it was someone with ill intentions; I avoided something terrible happening to me.

To those commenting in bad faith: maybe fully read my post next time before commenting, but regardless I sincerely hope nobody close to you winds up in any bad situations if that's how you react to them. I actually can't take your opinions seriously because I know your reaction would be something like ""it's your fault for not being careful enough"" if something *did* happen to me. Always our fault, isn't it?

–

It happened around an hour ago, but I'm still shaken up and I legitimately feel like I've dodged a massive bullet.

It's 12AM in my timezone at the moment, and I'm currently driving home with my partner. We still have two hours to go, but I really had to pee so we stopped at a rest stop. I went into the women's bathroom &amp; IMMEDIATELY got a bad feeling about the place.

It was totally empty and dead silent, the entrance was a heavy door that I had to push open with my body weight, no cameras outside. The sinks were lined up by the entrance, and the three stalls were separated with walls, their doors also quite heavy. My gut was telling me something's wrong so I tried to quietly check if anyone else was in there with me (the doors were floor to ceiling high). The first and the last stalls were open, the middle one was locked. 

That looked door was sending warning signals to my brain, but I *really* had to pee. I slowly creeped past to get to the last stall &amp; there was no TP so I didn't use it. I DID stop and listen if I could hear anyone in the middle stall. There were no noises – no breathing, clothes rustling, feet shuffling, etc. Nothing. I stepped out to reach the first stall, again creeping past the locked door. This stall also had no TP, so again I didn't use it. Before leaving I stopped to wash my hands in the sink closest to the entrance... 

Guys, just when the water turned on I heard that door *unlock*. I fled that bathroom as quickly as physically possible. I jumped into the car &amp; told my partner to lock the car doors, but to wait for a short while because I wanted to see who'll step out after me. Well, nobody stepped out, not even in the following minutes. I looked around the rest stop and the only other signs of life there were a van, a truck, and a camper (all of them parked and dark). Nobody else was there with us, it was dark and empty.

I'm still shaken up over it. It might seem like I'm making a big deal out of this, but I swear on anything that the whole situation was extremely concerning. Usually I'm very preventative about such situations, but because it's so late and I'm tired, my initial warning bells didn't ring loud enough. 

I'm never using non-commercial rest stops again, that's for sure.",TwoXChromosomes,6283,1694387729.0,1056,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16ff1ph/i_just_had_the_most_bone_chilling_experience_in_a/
I hate my boyfriend and I hate feeling this way,"EDIT.

Thanks to everyone who read and commented. I didn't expect so many people to read this; it's terribly long.

A lot of you are being very encouraging and understanding. Thank you for that. 

Many of you are asking why? Why am I even with this asshole? Why have I put up with it for so long? I should know this is all unacceptable, should've dumped him long ago, and so on. 

I think this is something a lot of people deal with when in bad relationships. Things don't necessarily start off bad. In my own case, things started off great. After he moved in, there were annoyances here and there, but at the time I chalked it up to being due to the adjustments having to be made living with a new person. Living with another person is tough. So I thought many of the inconveniences would dissipate over time. 

Things gradually progressed until they became identifiable patterns. My exhaustion grew; my unhappiness increased. Over time, I found myself getting upset and annoyed in his presence. I could feel my blood pressure rise when he walked into the room. 

At first I asked myself what it was I could do to change things. To make them better. I asked myself if I was the problem. 

Things were allowed to get to this point because it's not always obvious what the source of the problem is. 

I typed this all out and posted it because it was therapeutic on some level. I also needed feedback from others to make sure I wasn't crazy. I needed to make sure none of this was normal. (Now I know a few of you will jump on that statement and tell me I should KNOW none of it is normal. It's hard to untangle feelings from logic from memories from manipulation. Having to pick it all apart can be confusing.)

I \*did\* break up with him, after bringing up these issues multiple times. And of course, he claimed he only had good intentions. I was misinterpreting everything. 

As a quick UPDATE to the situation:

I broke up with him a few days ago. Since then, he's been avoiding being home. He only comes home at night to go to sleep. He has not harassed me for sex for the past two nights. He and I had a ""conversation"" last night, at his insistence. Apparently, he is doordashing for extra money (as of yesterday) and believes this is all just a big misunderstanding. A hiccup in our relationship. He also believes that there is ""someone else,"" that I dumped him because I'm interested in another man/talking to another man. This couldn't be further from the truth. I'm not sure if it's getting through to him that I'm unhappy because of our relationship, not because I want to run off with someone else. It seems easier for him to blame some nameless, faceless ""other man,"" rather than take responsibility. 

Again, thank you everyone who has read and commented on this post.

My boyfriend moved into my house a little over a year ago (previously, we had a great relationship). Since then I've grown to absolutely hate him. I feel on edge, stressed out, agitated, ready to retreat, angry, and uncomfortable whenever I see him or when I'm in the same room as him.

I have spent the past few months trying to figure out why. Initially I blamed myself (maybe I've suddenly become a miserable and crotchety person?), but I believe I have a multitude of reasons for feeling the way I feel.

Here, in no particular order, are the reasons I hate my boyfriend:

Reason # 1

Up until only the past month or so, but only after I repeatedly had to lose my everloving shit on him to finally get him to listen and acknowledge my discomfort, he would constantly (4-7x/week for about a year) nag, beg, coerce, guilt and shame me for sex. Every.Single.Night...as soon as I would go to the bedroom at night to go to bed, he would immediately start grabbing and ripping my clothes off, while demanding sex. He would aggressively paw at me in the most unappealing way imaginable. (And the thing is, I love sex. If my body doesn't feel completely destroyed from a long, work-filled day, I usually want to have sex.) And I would recoil because oftentimes the yanking and grabbing and tearing my clothes off was really uncomfortable, and in a few cases, painful. In fact, he pulled something in my back from grabbing me by the shoulders and yanking me around while trying to forcefully take my clothes off. It took months to heal.

So when I would cringe and try to physically distance myself from him (because I would feel overwhelmed and bombarded), he would immediately begin with the nagging. ""Oh, so I guess we're not fucking tonight? Why don't you want to fuck me? Why? Tell me why? Why don't you want to have sex?"" At this point I would be so turned off, I would decide (even if I originally wanted to have sex) that I would prefer to engage in any activity BUT sex with him. So I would tell him ""no, I guess we're not having sex tonight."" Then he'd ask ""why?"" ""Why? Why? Why? Why?"" I would tell him I simply wasn't in the mood (which was true, because I'd lose the desire to have sex after being manhandled and then asked in a weird, almost accusatory, nagging way if we weren't fucking.)

Then more ""why's"" would follow. Then he'd keep going. Nagging. Begging. Telling me if I didn't fuck him, his entire next day would be ruined. He'd tell me he didn't believe I wasn't in the mood, and would demand to know the ""real"" reason why. He'd accuse me of wanting other men. Etc., etc. THIS would happen during the majority of nights out of a week. I would oftentimes just give him what he wanted, just so I could get some peace and quiet. If I didn't give him what he wanted, the nagging and harassing would go on for HOURS. I would look at my phone occasionally. 11pm. 12am. 1am. And every time I would feel devastated, knowing I had to be up early in the morning, and knowing that I would feel like garbage due to being kept up so late, all because he demanded to know WHY I wouldn't have sex with him.

On a few occasions, he would throw temper tantrums and stomp around and tell me he was leaving the house.

What was once a love for sex (on my end; always loved it), became having sex just to get him to leave me alone and let me finally sleep at night.

I've never in my life experienced this sort of behavior surrounding sex, and I've never in my life been so turned off by someone. Over time, I grew to resent him, mainly because he ruined the joy I always found in having sex with a partner, and also because my sleep and restfulness had suddenly taken a nosedive. My days became more exhausting, more unbearable, more tiring (and I'm an extremely busy person, with a mountain of responsibilities; I cannot afford to not get proper rest).

After a few months of this, I had started to feel stressed out before bedtime. I would hesitate to go up to the bedroom to go to sleep, because he would LITERALLY sit next to me on the couch and WAIT for me to begin walking upstairs so that he could run up and follow me and start his bullshit with the demanding and nagging for sex. It became a conundrum for me: I'm exhausted and I need to go to bed, so I want to go to bed, but I also know if I go up to bed, I won't be getting any sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason # 2

When he moved in, I realized that the rent he was paying at his old place was half the amount I pay at my place. And I didn't want to break him financially, so the agreement was for him to pay what comes out to 1/3 of the rent here. And that's perfectly fine by me.

That being said........

Only up until this past month, he has not bought any groceries for the house BUT he eats an insane amount of food. Oftentimes, while he's drunk/drinking, he gets the booze munchies and rips through the cabinets and refrigerator. A lot of times I would come downstairs in the morning, begin making coffee, etc., and find a bunch of empty food containers, packages, bags, boxes, etc. of brand new stuff I had just bought that was meant to last at least for the week (until my next shopping trip), but was now gone.

What's worse is that at no point did he ever think in his head ""wow, I just ate all of (insert food item), maybe I should go to the store and pick some more up so that my partner can have some."" No. Not at all. Never. The first time I brought up my frustration with the matter (in the very beginning), he was like ""oh, you told me I could help myself to whatever I wanted to eat? So what's the problem?""

I was like...""yeah, but I assumed you would help yourself while keeping me in mind. Like I buy this stuff because I also want to eat it. I don't think someone should have to tell you to have some consideration and leave some for me?""

He acted like he had no clue he wasn't supposed to just eat everything all the time and contribute nothing to the weekly groceries or replace anything. Now, whenever I (very politely, mind you) ask him to leave some food for me (usually when I see him drunkenly rip open a package and begin inhaling the items within), he gets defensive, as if I'm being mean. I just want to eat some of the stuff I buy for the house.

Additionally, he doesn't offer to help pay oil, electric, or anything else. I've brought this up - how it doesn't feel like a partnership because he doesn't even ask if I need help paying utilities. He reminded me that the agreement was the amount he's currently paying towards rent (which by the way amounts to $400/month. He's paying $100 a week to live in a house, eat for free, all utilities included).

&amp;#x200B;

Reason # 3

I guess this goes along with Reason # 2, but he always complains that he is broke. He doesn't make enough money. He has no money. He complains about money constantly. So when we go out, I always feel bad, because it seems like he somehow mentions how broke he is conveniently before we go out to dinner or do things together. So I feel almost obligated to pay. I feel guilty making my ""broke"" boyfriend pay for anything. But I know that's on me. That's a decision I'm making.

What pisses me off, is that in spite of how ""broke"" he is (he will often not have the money to pay his part of rent; he'll pay it late, or break it up into multiple payments throughout the month), he buys alcohol every night (with the exception of a random night here and there), go out to drink, AND for a while there, he was getting Amazon packages multiple times per week. He could afford to order a bunch of stuff for himself every week. But he can't ask me if I need help paying the electric bill.

&amp;#x200B;

Reason # 4

He's clingy and....I don't know how to describe it. There's no word to describe reason # 4, but....he's always up my ass. If I get up to move from one room to the next, or if we're sitting next to each other on the couch and I get up to go upstairs, he demands to know where I'm going and what I'm doing and then proceeds to ask ""why, why, why."" He does so in a very accusatory tone. There's this unsettling sound of urgency in his voice. All I'm doing is going upstairs to get something from the bathroom? Like no matter what I do or where I go in the house, he has to know what I'm doing, where I'm going and for what reason. I feel like I can't do anything without giving an explanation and it's exhausting.

I don't typically go out anywhere (besides work and to shop for groceries and household essentials), but the few times I've begun to leave the house (while of course telling him I had to run out really quick), without giving him a full-blown explanation of where I'm going and for what, he's acted like I was going out to...I don't know what....go to an orgy? The one time, I had to run to Target, and he demanded to know for what, wanted to know what was on my list. I was so exhausted from being followed around and harangued, I snapped at him...because who has time to tell someone their entire shopping list?

BUT THEN, he goes out and I don't bother him about it. I don't demand to know details, who, where, why. He actually goes out-out. Like to bars and to hang out with friends. I don't try to stop him. I don't ask him what he's doing. I don't bother him via text while he's out.

I typically use the nights where he's out as an opportunity to go to bed early, and without being harassed. And surprise, surprise...when he comes stumbling through the door late at night, he ALWAYS shakes me awake and demands sex. Sometimes he wakes me up and accuses me of talking to other men while he was away, and it turns into this big thing and I don't get that extra sleep I had so badly needed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are actually some more major reasons, but I'm now realizing how long this post is.

I told him I no longer wanted to be with him. I don't know how that's going to go, because he lives here now, and I know he can't afford to move out. Of course, he's upset. He tells me everything he does comes from a good place. He has good intentions. With the sex, he says it's not as bad as I make it out to be, or that it's not as often as I claim it is. That's not true. I know how often and how bad it's been. Perhaps the fact that he drinks skews his memory? He claims he only asks me a million questions because he's ""trying to start a conversation."" He only follows me around ""because he loves being around me."" In his mind, he's being a saint. And I'm just misunderstanding him.

So of course, I keep going back and forth. Do I dump him? Stay with him? Am I the bad guy?

I've really been thinking about this. I haven't seen him all day, as he seems to be avoiding me and avoiding being at the house (for the last two days.) I feel more calm and peaceful than I have in over a year.

I have to listen to the way I feel around him, which is straight up trash.

Had to leave the park because of a man.,"Yesterday I (27F) took my daughter (4F) to the park and she was playing and then coming back to have a snack or drink or whatever. So we had a backpack with a few of our things spread out on the ground. We were the only ones there which was a little weird, but I figured it was Father’s Day so maybe everyone was home with their dads. 

Some guy walks up (just close enough to be able to talk with voices raised, but not close enough to hear if we spoke normally) and stands over by the little pavilion and asks if I mind if he smokes. I was like, oh that’s kind of considerate, but he’s far enough away so idc. I tell him that’s fine and he starts smoking weed (which is legal and totally fine, but not what I was expecting). 

My daughter asks to swing, so I get up and start pushing her. The dude is like “Happy Father’s Day” which immediately makes me feel off because it’s like he’s acknowledging that I’m a woman here with a kid by myself, but I just say “yeah thanks”

Then he asks if she’s my daughter and I say yes to which he says “oh you’re a YOUNG mom” and I say “not that young, but thanks” as dry as I can manage. Meanwhile thinking in my head that my story will be that my husband is at home having a little time to himself for the holiday. Meanwhile ALSO whispering to my daughter that we need to go. She obviously doesn’t want to and I tell her just a few more pushes and we’ll go. And he’s still shouting questions. 

“Is she your only kid?”

“Yeah”

“Do you want more?”

“Not right now”

“Do you guys like coming here a lot?”

“Sometimes”

“Yeah I used to bring my kids here all the time”

“Cool”

She gets down, I go start gathering our things up and shoving them in our backpack, and she starts talking about wanting to play ninjas. I put on the backpack and my sunglasses and she runs away so I follow her, and he goes “you look real good in those, mom, you’re cute!” And I just kind of grunt, and follow her around the playground trying to communicate to her as clearly and calmly as I can that WE HAVE TO GO. I’m scared to be there, I don’t know if that man is safe, and I don’t want to just grab her and run because then he KNOWS I’m scared. Plus he’s been texting periodically and maybe it’s paranoia, but what if he was texting people that we were there alone?

Daughter finally agrees to go, so I carry her to the car, throw her in through my door, get in, lock the doors, and see him walking toward the parking lot. So now I am FREAKING OUT, buckle her, get the key in the ignition and get the car started right as he walks past my car, and walks TOWARD HIS OWN CAR. I drive away trembling and checking the rear view mirror like crazy. 

But like, what kind of adult drives to a children’s park to smoke weed? Or did he see us, and specifically stop? Plus, WHY do men have to harass us in the first place? I was wearing sweats and a tshirt (not that it matters, they never have the right regardless, but I know I looked plain and dumpy) I just feel fucked up about the whole thing and now I’m nervous to go back to the park in case he shows up, and my daughter loves that park. 

Sorry for all of the word vomit, but I just had to tell someone other than my mom (who is totally 100% on my side btw)",TwoXChromosomes,11904,1655736253.0,1284,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vgn3td/had_to_leave_the_park_because_of_a_man/
This is why many women don't feel safe using rideshare services. After a serious safety incident where my Lyft driver refused to pick me up unless I gave him my personal phone number and email (leaving me alone in a high crime area at night) Lyft ignored me saying I wasn't safe and refused to refund,"I prebooked a driver on Lyft, because I was in an unsafe part of the city, staying with a friend who had to dodge stray bullets while walking the dog at 2pm just two weeks ago. I get my suitcases downstairs, driver is nearby, so I go outside, closing the door behind me. (I don't have a key and my friend is asleep) Suddenly the driver starts texting me repeatedly asking for my personal phone number and email, saying he needs it because there is ""an update"". This is obviously completely wrong, there is no reason for the driver to get this info. A criminal scam at best, a dangerous safety situation at worst since he knows from my picture that I'm a woman.

I refuse. He refuses to come my way and keeps asking. Obviously at this point I have to cancel the ride. $5 charge!!

I contact their safety team to report this. They ask if I'm safe. I say NO, actually I'm not safe. It's night time, I'm standing in a high crime area, alone, and now this creep knows exactly where I am standing, without a ride, having just canceled on him...

They respond with : ""Great, I'm glad you're safe!"" ????

And then refuse to refund me.... Best they can do is unpair me so I won't get this driver again. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.

**Edit: Half a million views on reddit already. Enjoy the bad publicity $5 bought you, Lyft execs!**

Edit 2: The $5 has been refunded with a rather vague, evasive apology that doesn't really take responsibility:

""Thank you for your patience. You were charged a cancellation fee, we apologize for any confusion previously. We understand that you were being asked for personal information, and please know, Lyft will only ever request personal information using:

Phone number: 855-529-5676
SMS text number: 61416

We refunded the $5 cancelation fee. This may take 5-7 business days for your bank to process.

We thank you for contacting us today and for being a valued part of the Lyft community, it was our pleasure assisting you with your cancellation, and if you have any other questions, please reach out.""

Edit 3: Oh hey, they're calling me on the phone now. Lmao. I didn't pick up. I guess 2.5 million views on reddit was enough to finally escalate this.

Edit 4: Holy fuck the official account for Lyft has doxxed me.",TwoXChromosomes,16585,1685972051.0,499,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/141er76/this_is_why_many_women_dont_feel_safe_using/
The time my male friend actually realized how regularly women get harassed just walking down the street.,"This happened a few years ago, but I often feel the need to post this story in various comments, so I'd figure I'd make my own post. 

I used to play in a metal band. I'm the only woman member in that band. We were playing a gig in a seedier side of a city, and I wanted to hit up a liquor store to grab a drink before we played (dry venue.) I asked one of my band mates to walk with me for the 2 blocks to the store. He was a bit annoyed cause it was right there, but agreed cause all he had to do was make a phone call and he could do that at the same time. 

He's walking several paces behind me cause he's on an important phone call. We didn't look like we were walking together. 

Now I will say for shows, I like to dress up a little. Maybe a torn up shirt and thick leggings with boots. 2 guys came walking down the side walk from the other direction, and split so I was in the middle. 

""Hey baby, I like your outfit."" ""Where you going, you look sexy as fuck."" I felt one of their fingers actually reach out and touch my waist through one of the tears in my shirt. 

I kept eyes forward, mouth closed, and kept walking. ""Fine, fuck you, bitch."" As they kept walking the other way. 

My band mate came up next to me (having ended his call.) Convo went like so:

Him: ""hey, you knew those guys, right?""

Me: ""nope. Complete strangers.""

Him: ""what the fuck? Did they actually touch you?""

Me: ""Yup. This happens literally all the time to any woman that walks down the street alone. Why do you think I asked one of you guys to come with me?""

His eyes just widened. It's like something clicked in his brain. Men don't experience or first hand witness this at the same frequency as women. Even though I didn't acknowledge the guys whatsoever, my bandmates first assumption was that I knew them. 

Needless to say, he walked right next to me on the way back.



Edit: Just checked reddit for the first time after posting this, and holy crap! I'm not really sure what to say. It makes me so sad that so many people have the same experience. But, I'm glad that in the modern day of technology, we can support each other. Thank you to the men are allies as well. And to the men PM'ing me calling me sexist or dramatic: You give me the rage fuel I need to continue to speak out, drink gasoline &lt;3

Also, notice how neither this post nor anyone here is saying that all men harass women. No one is claiming that. But every woman has the same experience with a some number of men that is &gt;0. If you take this as a ""you hate all men"" maybe you are projecting.",TwoXChromosomes,27380,1607175385.0,1558,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/k77l9e/the_time_my_male_friend_actually_realized_how/
THINGS EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT HER BODY,"I've met alot of women in my life who were unaware about various things about the female body, myself included. As a teenager, there were alot of things I've learned that I thought was true, only to realize it isn't.
I wanted to make a post to share things I've learned over the years, and debunk myths.
This is mostly aimed at teenage girls/young women. But who knows! Maybe you learn something new aswell, even if you don't fit that category.

If you have anything you want to add, feel free to do so in the comments!


**PEE AFTER SEX**
Peeing after sex can help to flush bacteria out of the urethra, and therefore help avoiding an UTI.








**Sex shouldn't hurt your first time**
People make having sex with men as a woman for the first time sound like a complete horror story.
But I'm happy to say, it's not!
It's normal to feel a little sore afterwards, but it's not supposed to be painful.
Don't rush it, have fun with eachother. Make out, touch eachother, etc. 
If it's difficult to insert the penis or if it's painful, leave it be, and do some more foreplay.








**Your vagina is self-cleaning**
Vaginas are self cleaning. You never need to clean the inside of your vagina with water, soap or any other feminine hygiene products. 
The vulva can be cleaned with a gentle unscented soap if this doesn't irritate you, but can contribute to recurrent yeast infections or Bacterial Vaginosis for some people.
Using water alone to clean your vulva is what is recommended by medical professionals.











**Having stains on your clean underwear is normal**
The vagina has a acidic pH level, that's why discharge can leave stains on your underwear. It's completely normal, and that doesn't mean your underwear isn't clean.








**Semen can mess up your vaginas pH-level**
The optimal vaginal pH level is between 3.8 and 4.5, which makes it acidic. 
Semen and soap have an alkaline pH, in the 7-9 range.
Because of this, the presence of semen can elevate your vaginal pH long after sex.
If you often have problems with UTIs after having sex, this may be the reason why.
The best way to deal with this is using a condom.

EDIT:
Lubed condoms can actually mess with your pH levels aswell.
Many popular brands of lube/condoms can irritate the vagina due to it's pH level.

- If a product is CE marked, it’s a confirmation that it’s safe for the bodily environment it was intended for, by European Economic Area (EEA) standards. Without this, there’s no confirmation that your lube product doesn’t contain anything that’s harmful to your vulva skin and vaginal pH.
- Avoid lubes/condoms that have flavors/fragrances such as fruity, floral, candy, etc.
- Avoid: Glycerin(e), Propylene Glycol, Nonoxynol 9, Chlorhexedine Gluconate, Petroleum Oils, Polyquaternium-15, Benzocaine, Sugars &amp; Sugar Alcohols, Ureas.

Thank you u/DiabloStorm for informing me about this!
Here's a guide about everything to do with lube, I highly recommed it: http://dangerouslilly.com/lube-guide






**80% of women don't orgasm from penetrative sex**
Can't seem to reach an orgasm during penetrative sex? You're definitely not alone!
The vast majority of women are only able to orgasm from clitorial stimulation, the clit is the only thing on the human body that exists for pleasure only, after all, experiment with it!
Don't accept that sex is done when he reaches an orgasm, when he didn't even try to pleasure you aswell.
Your pleasure is just as important as theirs.






**Most women don't bleed their first time**
In some cultures, a husbands family demands to see bloody sheets after the wedding night, to prove that the bride was a virgin. This is false.
Only 1 in 5 women bleed their first time, I didn't bleed the first time I had sex.
Bleeding or not doesn't prove if the women has or hasn't had sex before.
Quick note: If you're a woman who needs to prove her ""virginity"" by showing bloody sheets on her wedding night, and you're worried that you won't bleed, please DM me. There are multiple ways you can fake bleed, I can help you. Surgery is the worst thing you can do, there are different options that are much better!







**Nobody can look inside your vagina and determine if you've had sex or not**
There have been cases of people taking their girlfriends/daughters/wives to a gynecologist to see if they have stretched their hymen or not.
Like the rapper T.I, who took his 18 year old daughter to a gynecologist to get answers.
The truth is that no doctor or gynecologist can examine you to see if you've had sex or not, that's something only you know.
The hymen can stretch from doing everyday things, running, sports, riding a bike, etc. It has nothing to do with proving if you've had sex or not, it's just impossible to prove that. Some women are born without a hymen.
Please don't be discouraged to do sports and other things to avoid streatching your hymen.
There's help out there for women who need to prove their ""virginity"" to their boyfriend/father/husband this way. No person should ever do that to you. Please DM me if you're in that situation, I will more than gladly help you.
Virginity is a made up concept to make people feel ashamed about their sexual experiences or lack there of. Again,  nobody can determine if you've had sex or not.

EDIT:
Thank you u/Chickiri for posting this great and informative comment:

""While it's not possible to tell wether you're a virgin or not based on the state of your hymen alone, there are ways to detect wether or not you've had sex, which are especially important in the case of rape. If you've been raped/fear you've been raped (if you feel like maybe you've been drugged/intoxicated/any other situation), please seek a professional: this is very important for your health, and for any legal action you might want to take.""

This is very important, it's completely understandable if you're afraid to report it. But please go to the hospital first thing, don't shower or change clothes. They will help tremendously, and they won't force you to report if you don't want to.






**Having large labia minora is normal**
Labiaplasty is getting more and more popular amongst young women, because they feel like their vulva is ""abnormal"".
It isn't, every single vulva is normal. There is not a ""right"" way for a vulva to look. 
There's a woman and activist called mediclit on twitter, she got a labiaplasty at 18. The procedure left her mutilated, and she no longer have any feeling in her clitoris. If you're interested in this topic, I suggest checking her out.
Please be safe!








**It's totally normal for one boob to be bigger than the other**
It's way more common to have asymmetrical boobs than have symmetrical ones. It's actually very rare to have perfectly symmetrical boobs, don't worry about it!
That being said, if you suddenly develop asymmetry, like a sudden increase or decrase in volume of the boobs, you should get that checked out. That’s especially true if that change comes with other symptoms like skin retraction, or thickening, dimpling, or a change in color of your breast. 








**You can get pregnant during your period**
It's very unlikely, but it's not impossible.
Once inside a woman, sperm can wait for an egg for up to a week. Ovulation can occur soon after, or even during, the bleeding phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, giving the sperm the chance to get lucky. 








**The vagina does not become ""loose"" if you have alot of sex**
Ever wondered why men say a woman who've slept with a 100 men have a ""loose"" vagina, but a woman who slept with the same man a 100 times doesn't? Me too!
This is simply a slut-shaming tactic, it isn't true. 
Virginity is a social construct, and who many people you've sex with is nobodys business, and it doesn't determine your worth.
The vagina can push out an entire baby and go back to its normal size, a dick won't change shit.






**Birthcontrol isn't only for avoiding pregnancy**
I had very painful periods as a teenager, had all horrible sideeffects you could think of.
My mom suggested that I tried birthcontrol. Her suggestion made me feel embarrassed, I associated birthcontrol with having sex, and I hadn't had sex before at that age.
She explained that you can go on birthcontrol even if you aren't sexually active, and she's absolutely right.
There's many reasons why a woman would choose to go on birthcontrol, preventing pregnancy is only one of many.






**Penetrative sex isn't the only way to have sex**
This annoys me alot. As a bisexual woman, I've been asked numerous times how two women have sex. They never ask how two men have sex, why? Because a dick is involved.
This is especially irritating considering that only 20% of women are able to orgasm that way.
To clarify, sex isn't just being able to orgasm either. But it annoys me that many men totally ignore the part that makes women reach climax, and won't even consider it sex.
Sex is so much more than just penetration, have fun with it, explore.




**Vaginal discharge 101**
I used Mama Doctor Jones video about discharge to provide pictures to better show what I mean. Thank your everybody who suggested her channel in the comments, very informative, and I highly recommend checking her out, you can find her video [here] (https://youtu.be/KHF8mB_8LUM)

Discharge is a completely normal bodily function that cleans and protects the vagina.
Your vaginal discharge can vary depending on your cycle, and it can vary from person to person.
Some of us have alot, some of us have less, it's completely normal.
I do not recommend wearing pantyliners on a daily basis to prevent getting discharge on your underwear, it can irritate the skin of the vulva. 

**Healthy/Normal discharge**
The color of vaginal discharge more commenly white or off-white, but sometimes it can have a bit of a yellow hue, and sometimes it can have a more transparent look.
[Here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHfQyZ.jpg) are some examples of normal consistencies and colors of discharge.

*In the absence of any other symptoms*, these consistencies are completely normal:

- Watery/Clear

- Gel-like ""stringy"" discharge, normally happends before ovulation.

- Also consistencies that I included in the photo.

Your discharge may be a brownish color, this is also normal, reference photo [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHDEfo.jpg)
This is called spotting.
Spotting is defined as light vaginal bleeding that happens outside of your regular periods.
This kind of brown discharge can often happend at the end of your cycle. It's old blood mixed with discharge, which creates a brown-like color.

**Abnormal discharge**
First of all, it's important to recognise how your discharge usually smell like. It shouldn't smell foul, but it's normal to have a smell or lack of it. If it does have a funny smell, it's a sign that you should get it checked up.

Cottage cheese-like chunks in your vaginal discharge, looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHlZIV.jpg)

This can often signify a yeast infection.
Especially if it's followed by any of these symptoms:

- Genital Itching 

- Swelling

- Redness 

- Burning sensation while peeing or having penetrative sex

- Your discharge might smell a little ""off"" if you have a yeast infection, but it can also have no odor at all.


TREATMENT:
If it's your first time having an yeast infection, or if you're unsure if it is an yeast infection or not, make an appointment to your doctor.

Otherwise, you can buy a over-the-counter yeast treatment. (Not recommended for pregnant women, book an appointment)
If your symptoms persists, book an appointment.

Don't be embarrassed if you have a yeast infection, it's very common but unpleasant. Don't be afraid to seek treatment.

To reduce your risk of vaginal yeast infections: 

- Wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.

Avoid:

- Tight-fitting pantyhose

- Douching, which removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protect you from infection

- Scented feminine products, including bubble bath, pads and tampons

The following may increase your likelihood of yeast infections:
- Stress

- Diabetes

- Use of birth control pills

- Pregnancy

- Antibiotics, especially prolonged use over 10 days




Alot of yellow discharge that looks like [this] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHs8JF.jpg) especially if you have other symptoms could indicate chlamydia.
A slight yellow hue can be normal in certain situations. But if you feel other symptoms, or if you recently had sex with a new person, you should get that checked out.
Remember! Some people don't have any symptoms when they have chlamydia. Untreated chlamydia can result in serious health complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease.
That's why it's very important to use a condom when having sex, and get tested if you have any doubts.

If you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STDs, seek medical treatment.

Lime green discharge, that kinda looks like mucus in my opinion, reference [here]
(https://pasteboard.co/JZHvzad.jpg)
And [here] (https://pasteboard.co/JZHvNlq.jpg)
If you have a new sexpartner or in any situation where you can be at risk for STI or STDs, this can indicate gonorrhea or trichomoniasis.

Symptoms of trichomoniasis:
- Itching, burning, redness or soreness of the genitals

-Discomfort with urination

-A change in their vaginal discharge (i.e., thin discharge or increased volume) that can be clear, white, yellowish, or greenish with an unusual fishy smell

Symptoms of gonorrhea:
- an unusual vaginal discharge, which may be thin or watery and green or yellow in colour

- Pain or a burning sensation when peeing

- Pain or tenderness in the lower abdominal area  (this is less common)

- Bleeding between periods, heavier periods and bleeding after sex (this is less common)

If you suspect that you have any kind of STI or STD, seek medical attention.

If your discharge have a thin, gray color, it can indicate bacterial vaginosis. Couldn't find a good reference photo for this one, sorry about that.

What is bacterial vaginosis?
Bacterial vaginosis is a type of vaginal inflammation caused by the overgrowth of bacteria naturally found in the vagina, which upsets the natural balance.

Symptoms:
- Grey-like discharge

-Discharge have a strong fishy odor

- Burning feeling when you pee

- Itching

50% of women do not have any symptoms.

When to see a doctor:

-You have vaginal discharge that's new and associated with an odor or fever. Your doctor can help determine the cause and identify signs and symptoms.

- You've had vaginal infections before, but the color and consistency of your discharge seems different this time.

- You have multiple sex partners or a recent new partner. Sometimes, the signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection are similar to those of bacterial vaginosis.

- You try self-treatment for a yeast infection with an over-the-counter treatment and your symptoms persist.






**Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)**
TSS is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by bacteria getting into the body and releasing harmful toxins.
This can affect both men, women and children.
Risk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons.
Having your tampons in for longer than 8-12 hours can increase the risk of an infection or TSS.

Symptoms:
The symptoms of toxic shock syndrome start suddenly and get worse quickly. They include:

- A high temperature

- Flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, feeling cold, feeling tired or exhausted, an aching body, a sore throat and a cough

- Feeling and being sick

- Diarrhoea

- A widespread sunburn-like rash

- Lips, tongue and the whites of the eyes turning a bright red

- Dizziness or fainting

- Difficulty breathing

- Confusion

TSS is very rare, but these symptoms should absolutely not be ignored, if you experience these symptoms, contact medical emergencies immediately. If you're using a tampon while experiencing these symptoms, remove it straight away. Inform medical staff if have used a tampon while experiencing these symptoms.



Like I said, feel free to add anything if I forgot about something.

I hope you all have an amazing day!

Thank you so much for the awards and positive comments. 
Your comments warms my heart, I'm so glad that many of you have found it helpful.

Seeing that many parents show their daughters and sons my post makes me so incredibly proud of myself, you have no idea how much it means to me.


I'm happy that many women and girls are comfortable  enough to DM me with questions about their body, questions that they're afraid to ask in real life.

"""Excuse me miss, don't feel alarmed, I'm walking behind you to get to my car. I'm going at a bit of a fast pace. Don't worry, I'm walking right past you""","Said the man who walked righr past me, as stated to his car on my brief stay in Minneapolis. I was going to get dinner and I was on the phone with my mom just in case because it is dark out and I was scared. 

Right as I'm about to get inside, he says this to me and it immediately made my night better. Of course I'd like to live in a world where I don't feel threatened and where men don't feel the need to make their intentions known as they walk past me. But knowing that he was aware of the fears many women have and willing to do that for me. It just made my night. 

I'm getting surgery tomorrow, and have been all rattled up, so, I genuinely feel a lot more at ease now thanks to this kind stranger.

I think some men in my neighborhood are preying on me and I’m so scared. Advice please.,"I am a 22 year old who graduated from college just last year and moved into my very first place alone. It is a small apartment complex and I’m out walking my dog/running errands all the time, so it’s pretty easy to catch on to my schedule and my lifestyle with just some friendly chatting or observance. 

Two specific men have been actively stalking me (I think?) and my gut is telling me to run/do something. 

The first guy, Eddie, used to hit on me from his balcony or in the parking lot when I first moved in. Being naive I was nice and would chat, but very quickly started shutting conversations down and basically running from him when I realized he would watch from his balcony to see when I got home and then come down to encounter me on the stairs. Once I was carrying groceries inside and he pretty much *blocked* me from getting into the breezeway insisting to help me with my groceries. Being panicky and naive, I let him help me with the groceries into my apartment. I feel like once he realized I live alone, his alarming actions escalated. He noticed I didn’t have any bedroom furniture and told me his daughter had a bedroom set in storage that he would give me for cheap. I gave him my number and told him to send me a picture of it. He never did, and several repeat encounters afterwards he kept inviting me to go to the storage room to check out his daughter’s furniture, that he would even drive me, and I would always remind him to send me the pictures. Once he even pulled up to me in his car and I thought I was going to be kidnapped. Now I literally either pretend I’m on the phone or speed right past him, it feels like a horror movie. 

The other guy, don’t know his name so I’ll call him Shepherd because he has a German shepherd, basically started the same way - hitting on me from his balcony and then coming down to encounter me. Having gone through this, I very quickly brushed him off and ignored him. Just recently he started walking his dog the exact time I leave for work and the exact time I come home. Today he waved me down in the road as I was parking and I tried to wait in my car for him to finish walking his dog so I could get out, and he stood waiting. The other night he was talking to me and saw me walk into my apartment and began to walk his dog alongside me saying it was time for him to head home too - I know he was following me because he doesn’t even live in my building. He was in my breezeway last night before I left for work and then this morning after flagging me down. So now he knows which unit I live in, my car, and that I live alone. 

I am so scared. I bought pepper gel and lock my doors - what the hell else can I do? They’re not doing anything illegal so I can’t call the cops. My gut lurches every time I see these men because their honing in just gets more and more intense. They know my every move. What do I do? 

TL;DR: I think two men are preying on me and I feel defenseless and afraid.",TwoXChromosomes,10222,1630068214.0,1850,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/pcml1l/i_think_some_men_in_my_neighborhood_are_preying/
I feel deeply ashamed and embarrassed after asking strangers for help in an emergency.,"This might be long, but I don't yet feel comfortable talking about it with friends yet, so I'm telling Reddit.

A few days ago I was opening at work. It was early morning, still dark out, the store wasn't open to the public yet and I was completely alone. I took a lozenge as I'm recovering from illness and I started to choke. I tried to throw myself on the back of a chair, but it didn't work. I ran out of the shop into the street and basically began flailing around, doing the choking sign, trying to get anyone's attention. I couldn't breath, speak, or swallow. 

There were just a few people out, and they were looking at me like I was crazy, trying to avoid me (I live in a big city so this was a relatively normal assumption to make I suppose) and I felt so helpless. Finally two people noticed me (a man and a young woman, separately) and I guess realized I was being legit. The man tried to give me the Heimlich and the girl called 911. The man seemed annoyed by me and the girl looked suspicious still and kind of alarmed but I'm grateful for their help.

While he was helping me the piece became dislodged and I could breathe (narrowly) and speak again, but the lozenge was still stuck in my throat and I couldn't swallow it. I was still in a state of panic. The man was telling me ""You're breathing, though"" in a way that felt accussatory, like I shouldn't be panicking anymore, and that's when I started to feel extremely embarrassed. 

I felt so guilty for bothering them and for making a scene. I immediately started apologizing and getting insecure of how I must have looked in the moment. I still am.

The EMT's arrived after I could breathe again. There were about 8 EMT's there, all male. They checked on me but since I could speak and breathe, I felt they weren't taking me seriously. ""Sometimes people think they're choking when they're not. Don't worry, we get these calls all the time."" Okay, well, I could not breathe for a bit so pardon my assumption. 

I told them it was still stuck in my throat, they look with a light but didn't see anything. They were mostly helping me calm down and gave me water, and it overall just felt invalidating. I think this is why I am embarrassed to tell people this story, because I don't want to be made to feel that my panic was an overreaction. Maybe there is a technical difference between ""choking"" and whatever was happening to me (the piece didn't ""come up,"" but was eventually either dislodged or dissolved enough for me to swallow it with water, which is a distinction they made a point to tell me) but it sure felt like an emergency. 

I just can't shake the feeling of embarrassment at having to get help from strangers and having them see me in such a state. And then I feel shame for feeling embarrassed. 

I'm posting this here because I think it's common for women to feel this way and it sucks. I guess I'm just wanting to get it out and wondering if anyone has experienced something like this, and how to get out of that cycle of guilt.

TL;DR I choked and am now feeling deeply embarrassed from having to ask strangers for help and inconveniencing them. I'm not sure how to shake it. Has this feeling happened to any other women out there?",TwoXChromosomes,1342,1761596396.0,273,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ohpcea/i_feel_deeply_ashamed_and_embarrassed_after/
I was lost in the big city at night without my phone. Ran into a group of men. Turned out better than I hoped.,"So this Saturday i was a long way from home at a festival-like event with my bff and some girls from her university class. It was fun and we danced and got a little too many beers.

Unfortunately on my way home, I got separated from them. Oh well, this happens - let me just call… oh no. My phone is dead. And suddenly I was all alone in a city i didn’t live in with no way to contact anyone at the middle if the night. 

I was SO scared. I began crying and aimlessly walking toward the next bus stop. I had no idea how to get home - only knew if I could get to the main station, then there was a chance. But i didn’t know where i was or how to get there. I got on the first bus and asked if it took me there. It did not - but somewhat close to there. And i just couldn’t stop crying. 

Out of no where - this guy swooped in and asked me if i was ok. He heard me crying and was so concerned about me. And me being scared and drunk i told him my issue and what city I lived in. He gathered his guys (they were a couple of friends who went out together) and went to tell me not to worry and promised they would get me home safe. 

They tried to cheer me up and asked me about life and school. Introduced themselves and asked if I had anyone I would like to call. Offered me their phones. I called my mom and bf - and neither picked up - so they wrote them a text explaining the situation. And that they were helping me get home and not to worry. 


We all finally got on the train together headed for the city i live in (two of them were headed the same way) and helped me check in and even offered to pay for my way home if necessary.

We finally got to my city and they smiled - asked if could find my way back home (i could) - and then said goodbye and left. They wanted nothing from me but knowing i was safe. 

I have been so moved by this experience. A group of guys in their thirties taking their time to help a dumb little 21 year old me get home safe. Wanting nothing in return.

In a world so cruel and harsh as ours its been so incredible to know kind people still exist. I don not believe I will ever forget them. I just wish i could show them how grateful i am for their help.

So thats it. I just wanted to share some positive with you all.",TwoXChromosomes,23712,1653299040.0,590,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/uvwimj/i_was_lost_in_the_big_city_at_night_without_my/
Egypt is a hellhole and no one cares,"First of all, i am literally typing in tears , i feel so helpless and insignificant, i feel like i am fighting a losing fight Everytime i speak


And i am not even the targeted minority here, we have legit 99.99% of rape and harrasement victims of the entire female population, 


We have such a toxic culture , where if you got raped your social life is over and you should kill yourself ""sheikhs have said that"" and that the only way out of it is marrying the bloody rapist , so girls just never tell


But in private and in a safe space everyone has over a shit ton of stories, girls get raped no matter what age or what they were , then some sheikhs come and say ""they provoked it on themselves by wearing those clothes"" 


Then u ask what clothes are ok, they go anything other than a hot short, some other will go, no anything other than hijab is wrong and worthy of rape, and some go no no it's either niqab or rape, and some go, that women getting out of their houses is enough to provoke men


They are literally  excusing actual rape, and some young sheikh with 2 million followers was asked ""what about women who wear niqab yet get raped?"" He replied "" it's because men saw earlier women wearing provocative clothing, so the pent up pressure is forced upon them""


WHAT, I don't mind horrible and dumb thinking , but not when it has this influence and has no logic or proof or sense or anything


Imagine having Christian friends in this community, if i walk with a girl in the street we get harrased together and commented on, and people walk up to is saying dumb and offensive stuff like ""get out of here we don't want sluts like you here"" ""hey prostitute come to me after him please""


And the worst part is, i am a coward, I can't stand up though i know i am right, i can't defend or help anyone because i know if i even try to do anything they will harm both me and her horribly, and it will be without purpose


I open social media to find 80% of people supporting rape culture , actual rape, because who wouldn't when you have the power, every female friend I've gotten close to has told me a story of messed up sexual harrasement, and many of them have shared suicidal thoughts 


Any woman who tries to say anything is branded an ""atheist"" and a dumb ""feminist"", if a woman walks alone , no matter what she is wearing has the chance of 99.99% of getting raped or harrased, and he can't tell anyone or defend herself or either she is a dumb atheist feminist and how dare she think she has the same rights as men to walk in the street


And why would i come whine here, is it karma whoring, or virtue signaling


No, the issue is that people that share my thoughts here are people who are already rich enough to live in upper class and have enough influence and money to stop it, never face people like this, so we have not much of any activism


I have no platform, money, followers, looks, smarts, anything


I always came to reddit to find relatable people and ignore the hell hole i live in, but it's becoming harder everyday, and i am scared and weak, I don't even know what i want


If anyone can do anything, wether awareness, support or any form of help 


Please do, i hate being a weakling but that is who i am, i hope i can reach out to someone or people that can help, save me, save us


(edit:many people have this misconception , but i am a male, and i don't promote the idea of just travelling to a safe space, though logical and should be done,the idea of giving up on my country and leaving my friends and family behind to rot is holding me back , and stop blaming islam corrupt people will use whatever people are following and twist it)
 
Going even deeper, women aren't encouraged to find a job or travel or study much, as much as they are told ""when you marry a man, you'll be free to do as you please"", newsflash ,nope

There was a story of 2 women surrounded by 200 rapists, they sat in a store and called for help, and out was standing the rapists trying to get in, the  store owner had to kick them out because they might cause his property damage, from start to finish it is recorded and it is horrifying,and media said ""it's up for debate, did you see what they wore"", literally they had to get 4 male friends fighting a crowd of gropers who laughed as they pulled them from clothes and hair as they were crying

Women get called horrible shit and bullied online, people ""sliding""into the dms with entitlement, that if women don't respond , they steal pictures and threaten them with photoshoping them on nude bodies and ruin their lives and share them, while sending horrendous comments and pictures, and that is not extreme cases it also is a the norm

People who grope in public, harras online, black mail , are considered ""cool"" people ""living the life""

People of our community are discouraged to travel and leave the country, it's considered unpatriotic, and they always go ""look at their politicial issues, the even accept gays, they are no better than us if not worse, stay in a muslim country"" ,so most people think that this is the same everywhere, so no one seeks change or asylum as much

(People on reddit are twisting my words and using them to push political views, the same issue i am against, i stated facts of what happens, that any research will prove me right, i have said my own personal experience that many in the comments share similar experiences if not worse, if i am being punished for saying what is happening and what i feel about it , then so be it)

But i never advocate they stop taking immigrants, i support it whole heartedly,and it the most reasonable choice for us, and should be accepted by all

I never said i am against islam and said my issue was never with islam, it's with corrupt people in power here who use whatever works to control people, wether comedy, religion,culture,
Plus i am a Christian hence my name, and there are Christian people using Christian faith to support this insanity, so apparently the way i see it, the issie is with culture not religion currently

People will put their fingers in their ears and say i am a puppet, or i am a blind retard who supports islam, or a puppet made to be anti islam, the the whole post is about people like you who twist words to get what they want 

I am not saying arabs are bad, i am saying we still have a long road to go, and i hope we go it , so people DMing or commenting, do some research then come with an argument, not ""he's wrong, cuz I don't want to think about this""


And if you want to do research, there is the story of the 2 girls surrounded by the 200 rapists with videos proof, there is the story of the rapist of over 100 in the auc his name is ahmed something and was only jailed because public outcry but  will be let loose in no time after the fuss is over, just like what happend last time when another controversy happened when a teen killed another teen for defending a hirl from sexual harrasement, while caught in camer, it was glossed over , and you have sheikh abdullah elroshdy , he is one of the famous radical fake sheikhs, who abuses people's lack of knowledge and uses islam as a veil for his extremist thoughts, and he has a huge following

The problem is, no one in Egypt is denying these things happened, the problem is hos they excuse it, do your research if you want, talk to any girl who lives in egypt, males here don't notice it, and won't notice it unless they get  of their own way and they excuse it in their head, i am jot cherry picking, literally ask any girl who lives in Egypt",TwoXChromosomes,29034,1593974977.0,1405,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/hlrv00/egypt_is_a_hellhole_and_no_one_cares/
"Sometimes, you'll protect yourself, and in response, a man will call you a b----.","While I was walking my dog, Moose, after work last night, in the frozen darkness that is December at 6pm in Minnesota, I noticed a van, headlights offs, creeping along parallel to me behind a hedge in a parking lot.

As I walked faster, the van pulled ahead of me and stopped, and I could see two men inside silhouetted against the streetlight beyond.

I started making a wide berth around the back of the van, and immediately, one of the men leaned out of the passenger side door, and said, smiling, ""Hey, I love your dog - what kind is that? He's beautiful! He a boxer? HEY! Lemme see!""

I walked faster and hoped they couldn't see my legs shaking. Last thing I heard was, ""We were only being FRIENDLY, BITCH,"" and the scream of their tires.

And in that moment, I felt a pang of guilt. *For being ""mean"" to those two men.* Seriously. Yet if I **had** been been friendly to those creeps, and they ended up groping or grabbing me, *I would then have felt guilty for putting myself in a situation I knew was dangerous.*

So you know what? Fuck that guilt. Fuck feeling guilty for protecting yourself, and fuck feeling guilty when pieces of shit harass you.

&amp;#x200B;

And the next time someone calls you a b----, tell them to fuck off. For me. =)

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit**: To be clear, there was **no** actual reason for me to feel guilt in that situation. But fighting off nearly two decades of parents, relatives, pastors, and mentors telling me to ""submit"" to men, to be ""modest"" for them and ""gentle"" to them, is a hell of a battle. Bless therapy.

**Edit 2**: u/ Category\_Think just sent me a DM entitled, [""Why would anyone rape you?:""](https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/wv0bh1) with an enclosed message telling me why my body is unrapeable. Though many Redditors are wonderful, some men insist on making it a hellhole.

**Edit 3:** I now have men messaging me **telling me I'm being too hard on the rapey DM guy.**

My experience being a woman of color in the US,"Hi all. Throwaway for privacy.

I have seen a lot of stories come forth about what life is like when you have a little extra melanin. I have a lot of friends that sympathize, but they cannot really fathom what it is like. I wanted to share mine. For reference, I grew up in a middle class area in a liberal state. If this is not the place for this, please let me know. But these are experiences that I have lived. Sorry about the length and thank you for reading. On mobile so formatting.


Age 5: My best friend was a blonde little girl. One day, we were walking out of our kindergarten class together, and her father saw us walking together. He rushed forward and put his arm around her shoulder and ushered her away from me as quickly as he could. Later in the school year, we wanted to hang out after school like little five year old girls do. Her mother called my mother and told her how my mom made her uncomfortable, and she no longer wished to have us be friends.

Age 5 on: Having people be surprised that my mom is white, and be ridiculed for it.

Age 8: Called a n***** and told to get off of someone’s property, I was told that I was allowed to play there.

Age 10: Approached by a basketball coach and forced to play(I had NO talent for basketball).

Age 14: Shopping for dresses with my best friend. As we wondered the store, the same clerk followed us. They try to hide it, they are putting away clothes. We ask my mom why we keep seeing her, and my mom tells us that we are getting the “special treatment”.

Age 15: Shopping for hair supplies at a store aimed at black hair products. The Asian owner followed us the entire time, “straightening up” right next to us. When we tried to leave after buying something, which she saw, before we could leave the store, she accused us of shoplifting. She had literally just watched us buy the item that she observed us select from her special treatment.

Age 17: My now husband and I had just gotten out of school, and we walked down the street to the Rite Aid to get some snacks. The security guard refused to allow me to inter the store with my backpack, and they made us leave it up front at the cashier. The guard proceeded to just happen to be patrolling the store in whatever area we were in.

Age 18: I realized how difficult it is to find a hair stylist, because you can 100% tell when someone is afraid to touch your hair, or how obvious it becomes that they have no idea what they’re doing. But you learn to just pay them and don’t go back.

Age 19: We decided to get married. My husband’s dad told him, “You know she’s black. Your kids will be too.” His uncle told him he couldn’t believe he was marrying a n*****. His dad still treats me like absolute shit to this day. We have gone low contact.

Age 20: Realized that when I’m not being followed while I’m shopping, when I actually want help I get treated like I’m wasting their time. Or it’s hard to even find someone that will talk to me.

Age 20: I was at in class a predominately white university. I was the only black student in the class while we were reviewing Langston Hughes, and I was asked more than anyone to give my thoughts on the experiences he talked about.

Age 21: Attempted to get a job as a 911 dispatcher. I made it all the way to the portion where you have a super long interview about your life with a sheriff. He continually asked me about my “troubled past”(There isn’t one) and he didn’t believe me when I told him that I have NEVER been in trouble for anything. He asked me if I’d ever had sex in the car, or in any public places. To this day I don’t know why that was relevant. I did not get the job.

Age 22: I got hired at my current organization because I’m black and I speak Spanish. How do I know? The manager that hired me told me, “Thank God you speak Spanish, when I saw that you were black and that you’re fluent, that’s all I needed to know!” She proceeded to try to performance manage me out, in an attempt to say “Well, we tried to hire a minority but it just didn’t work out.”

Age 23: I ran into the same dad from my age 5 recount while I was at work one day. He knew I got married because his daughter was my bridesmaid. He proceeded to tell me how he daughter had done things “the right way” by going to school and finishing first before dating/getting into a relationship, and that he was so proud of her, but was sorry that I hadn’t had the same luck.

Age 24: People are surprised at how long and “soft looking” my hair is. I get asked a lot if it’s a weave or if I’ve permed it. A lot of unsolicited touching. Can we take a second and imagine that in reverse? I’ve never had my hands in a white girl’s hair, but imagine if I walked up to a complete stranger, announced that fact, and ran my fingers through her hair. I’d probably get arrested for assault.

Age 25: I was newly pregnant. It was my third pregnancy, but I had no living babies. My previous doctor couldn’t see me, so I had to find a new one. I found an OB that would see me, and my husband came. The doctor spent the entire time(without actually examining me) telling me how this pregnancy was not viable. He would not let me leave without getting a STD test. I told him my husband and I are exclusive and we’d been together for 11 years. “Well, you never know.” He took the sample anyway during my pelvic exam. When he did the ultrasound, he happily proclaimed that he was right, my uterus was empty. He offered to redo it in 2 weeks. When I left, the nurse gave me multiple pamphlets about being a black mom, and over the next several days I got calls from social workers offering free services and items for low income minority mothers. I never asked for that. They didn’t know my income. That same baby from that non-viable pregnancy is a year and a half now.

Age 25: It was a group of us out dress shopping for my best friend’s wedding. We stopped for lunch, and we had to wait for the restaurant to open. We were first waiting at the door, but were not seated first(This restaurant does not take reservations). They proceeded to proceed and wait on 6 other tables, who had ordered and gotten their food, before we were even approached to order our meals.

Age 26: I was pregnant with my daughter and I called into the doctor’s office multiple times with alarming symptoms. My blood pressure was high, and my limbs were so swollen I couldn’t sleep because they were hot and throbbing. My symptoms were dismissed until it was almost too late. Even when I was at the ER with trouble breathing and a pain in my chest, I was almost sent home. I still thank God for the OB that ran to grab me before I got discharged and diagnosed me with pre-ecclampsia. She saved mine and my daughter’s lives.

Age 26: My daughter was in the NICU for 66 days. Any concerns I raised about her care were brushed under the rug. There was a point where I complained to multiple nurses about the mask that they pushed into her face, and they were ignored. She has a scar on her nose now that was 100% preventable.

I want everyone to just imagine for a moment. Imagine that you just got a job. You’re ecstatic. But you walk in on your first day scared out of your mind, because you know you have to prove you’re worthy to be there. There is no one else that looks like you.  Imagine going shopping. Minding your own business when you notice the same person keeps asking you for help. Imagine not knowing if your friend group looks down on you because of how you look. Imagine your health, your feelings, your LIFE not being taken seriously. Imagine being made out to be a criminal before anyone even knows you, and being told “wow, you’re not like other black girls”. Imagine being told “Wow, you’re pretty/intelligent/well-spoken for a black girl.” Imagine being questioned in your own home, or on your way home, simply because you look like someone that committed a crime.

Have you ever been pulled over by a police officer? Were you scared? What did you say? Imagine being pulled out of your car because the officer suspects you to have drugs, but you were on your way to school. You’re forced out of the car, put in cuffs and you’ve got a boot on your back while you watch the cop’s partner plant the drugs in your own car. You go to prison for it. Your life is forever changed. Or this, that you were a little tired coming home from work, and you swerved a little. The officer pulls you over and arrests you for a DUI, regardless of having a 0.0 BAC.

I luckily have not been a victim of police brutality. However, my own brother has. He approached a man and was asking for assistance. The man claimed he had a gun, which he didn’t. That was apparently all the proof the court needed to convict, and he went to prison for three years.

Please, tell me again that we are equal. Please, tell me again that we should protest peacefully. We tried that. He took a knee during the national anthem and was fired for it. Tell me again that I should just deal with how things are, and to learn my place. That I should understand that I am intimidating because of my skin tone.

No. I will not sit down. I will not make excuses anymore that this is okay. I do not want to have to explain to my daughter and son how to not get shot by a police officer, because no matter what we do, no matter how little we resist and go with the flow, we are injured. We are set up. We are jailed. We are MURDERED simply for existing. There is no more time to be quiet. Yes, all lives absolutely matter. But the problem is that black lives matter less than white lives. The system needs to change, and it starts with you.

Guy I blocked years ago has just turned up banging on my door for the second time in so many months,"It’s around 8pm Friday night here. Each time I’ve said loudly and firmly to “please leave me alone’ he then bangs on the door a bit more trying to aggressively open the door knob then hovers on my street for about 30 minutes before leaving. It’s scary and I’m not sure what I can do about the behaviour (not that it’s my responsibility!). It also makes me angry that he feels so entitled to my company. 

It doesn’t seem police report worthy, but it’s making me feel unsafe in my home. Any advice?

Update: just happened again 10:30pm 24/11/2022 I had gotten a guard dog breed a short while after the last incident (posted here) and it helped, dog warned me and barked like mad, asked him to go away through the door and he did straight away. It’s been 167 days since he last did this.

I've had to deal with quite a few, probably because I work in a field where I have to be friendly, so whenever I'm at work, I'm just always sunshine and rainbows unless there's a reason not to be, and a lot of men don't understand thay this ISN'T flirting.

Now, I get it, to a degree. I've even had respectful, unexpected advances that I don't mind at all, nust politely reject and we can move forward as friendly coworkers. But that's not always how it happens.

When I am on shift I am one of two people on staff, just two people alone, separated by a ~5 minute walk. We recently lost an employee, so a week ago this guy at least 10 years my senior, who works for a company that essentially just sends temps to companies that need extremely temporary staff to cover shifts for a bit, started working on shift with me. Im friendly with him, like everyone, but I barely see him or talk to him. He's computer illiterate, so I give him my cellphone # (which is clearly posted on his desk anyways) so we can video call and I can walk him through fixing his computer instead of walking all the way over to his post to do it for him. He texted me off the clock after the first or second night of us working together reminding me to recommend him for the permanent position. I did not respond.

 Tonight, out of nowhere, he texts me from his post.

Him: Can i ask you a question?

Here I'm thinking ""ugh, men should really be careful when they say those words. He probably just needs help with his computer again, but that sentence has implications.""

Me: Sure, what's up?

Him: are you single or married?

Me: Neither, why?

Him: i just want to know

Me: That's not really a conversation I'm comfortable with.

Him: I'm sorry about that

Him again: hope you are not angry about it?

Me: I'd like to drop it. Thank you.

First of all, I have never flirted with this man in my life. I have never had a conversation thay listed more than 5 minutes with him. I have never indicated any sort of interest in him. Second, I am practically alone with this person for 8 hours a night, and he is much older, bigger, and stronger than me. He made me incredibly uncomfortable with a blatant, unwelcome, unwarranted advance.

I used to freeze when this sort of thing happened to me. I'd hedge and skirt and try to just get out of the situation. Running ad hiding was always safer. But recently I've found my footing, and found that I won't let people just tromp all over my boundaries with jackboots because they are bigger and scarier than me.

Instead of being upset that I was uncomfortable, this man is worried that I'm no longer going to recommend him for the permanent position. Really? You hope I'm not angry, you don't hope that I'm not too uncomfortable, or that I still feel safe working with you? Bite me.

He is asking for me to make HIM feel comfortable, because me stating my boundaries and telling him that he vastly overstepped them made HIM feel uncomfortable. Fuck that. Fuck him. He gets to feel uncomfortable because of his own actions, its not my job to make him feel better.

Edit: There are a lot of men (wow, so many) who don't really understand what it is that's going on for a woman in this situation. There were a couple of points in the comments that I'd like to illustrate to maybe help share the perspective of a woman dealing with this.

First(from myself):
""A man, much older, larger, and stronger than myself, with whom I am forced to work for 8 hours, alone, at night, has made an unwanted advance.

That, in and of itself, is pretty worrisome, but consider something else for a moment. Women are stalked, hurt, and murdered just for rejecting men, even politely, all around the world, all the time. When he asks me that question, do I know how this man is going to react to me rejecting him? No. Now I'm afraid.

Does he hurt me? No, he hasn't yet. Thank goodness. Now I'm upset, because of the position he put me in.

Now he apologizes, but it's obviously not a very heartfelt apology, he doesn't care that much that i am uncomfortable and upset.

Now he continues the conversation that I told him I was uncomfortable with to ask if I am angry. He doesn't care about uncomfortable, upset, scared. He cares about angry, because if I'm angry I won't recommend him for the position he wants, and that directly affects him.

And now I have to continue going to work with this man, and he is likely going to know that I recommend /against/ his getting the position.

And that is the situation that he has put me in.""

Second(from @Kiyomondo): 

""Let me illustrate for you two VERY different situations.

Scene A: you are at a bar and find yourself talking to an attractive woman. She is smiling, maintaining eye contact, facing you directly, engaging in the conversation. You're having a great time and it looks like she is too. You ask her if she's single. Depending on her response you either exchange numbers or jokingly curse your bad luck and wish her all the best.

Scene B: you've just started a new job. Your senior employee gives you her number so she can video call you to help get your pc set up because you struggle with technology. She's polite, friendly, cheerful, always has a smile for everyone. If you make a good impression on her it could benefit your career at this company. You don't talk much, though, and you've never seen her outside of work. So you send her a message, hinting that you're interested in the permanent position. No response. Oh well, after all you did use her number for personal communication outside of work, which is not the reason she shared it with you. Maybe she doesn't like that. She's beautiful though. Is she single or married? Oops she got upset for some reason, better make sure you didn't jeopardise your chance at promotion!

One of these approaches is acceptable, the other is clearly not. If you can't tell ghe difference, you may be part of the problem""

SHOUT OUT TO THE AMAZING MODERATORS FOR KICKING SOME SERIOUS INCEL ASS OUT THERE! GO TEAM!",TwoXChromosomes,14088,1597141505.0,1701,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/i7pb9f/its_not_my_job_to_make_a_man_feel_comfortable/
I'm really scared that I'm starting to hate men. I don't know how to stop it.,"I'm angry *all the time*. I'm experiencing a tremendous amount of compassion fatigue. I feel so burnt out that I'm empty. I go from happy to *extremely* angry within seconds. This is not my baseline, it's not something I've ever experienced before. I'm an LCSW and I've started to recognize in myself extremist thoughts. When I see a man, my gut reaction is anger and hurt. I want to throw things and cry for a million years.

My clients are almost exclusively men struggling in relationships or sexually abused children. Almost all of my friends are men. My longtime partner is a man (who I love). I am surrounded by male voices and male thoughts all day. Normally, this doesn't bother me. I love my friends, I love (most) of my clients, and I intend to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend.

Since Trump won the second election, my mental health has plummeted. I am ***so angry***. I'm an American citizen, but I was born and spent half of my childhood in a dictatorship where women were essentially cattle. I was adopted and then moved to the US with my parents. My partner is also originally from an authoritarian country, and his family moved to the US when he was a young child.

I decided that if Trump won, then I would leave the US. I'm Asian, a woman, an immigrant (with US citizenship), and a CSA survivor with damage to my cervix, requiring IVF and surrogacy or adoption to start a family, and it just felt too unsafe. I've been country hopping, trying to find a place that feels like home. My partner has been *insanely* supportive. Unprompted, he told me that he's decided to sell his businesses (large-scale, profitable businesses.) and leave the country with me, and we can build a life somewhere safer. He's amazing. He is supportive. He listens. When he gets it wrong, he's open minded. When I get it wrong, he's patient. He is a good man.

Fast forward to now, my mental health is struggling. I'm blasted every day with information about what is happening in the US, how incredibly familiar it feels to the country I escaped from as a child. I've become ***significantly*** less tolerant of sexism and the mild sexual harassment women experience daily. I go from 0 to 100 in a flash. When I see a man, my first thought is that there's a 1 in 4 chance he's a rapist, and if he isn't a rapist, he's friends with one,  and then I feel rage and genuine hatred towards him. This completely random guy I know nothing about. I'm not talking about the men who leer or overstep, I get angry with men who I see across the street. I have started to associate men with oppression.

The problem is, I don't know how I feel about it. It has damaged my relationship with the men in my life, including my boyfriend. The small sexist things said or did, that honestly almost all men do, that used to never bother me, now **incense** me.

Ten minutes ago, my boyfriend was asking for my advice about the best way to fire one of his employees, and then after I gave him advice, he made a joke that I could understand the employees perspective because we're both super emotional. I ***RAGED*** at him in a way that is NOT proportional to his behavior. I have been super emotional lately, it's not a secret, and he's handled it really fucking well... but I attacked him and called him sexist, and even though his comment is something that is used against women all the time, it's not what he meant, and I knew that it wasn't what he meant when he said it. But i still lashed out. He does have friends who are very sexist, and while it is something I tolerated before, I now think about every.single.day. I get angry out it, out of the blue, almost every day. I want to tell him that he needs to cut them out, but very obviously, that is not my place. He also confronts them when they are sexist (for the egregious stuff. He ignores the moderate to mild sexism from them) and it's caused me to lose a lot of respect for him. It's damaged how I feel about him. I still love him, I still want to be with him, but I don't feel as safe with him as I used to be. I think my feelings are somewhat fair, but probably not to the extent that I feel them. I'm making small pebbles into mountains, because I feel like I've been tripping over these pebbles my whole damn life and I just want to be able to walk on even ground with everyone else.

Yesterday, I spent *hours* arguing with a school teacher in the comments of a *deleted posted that no one would ever see or read*, because he was trying to argue that it's traumatizing for little boys to ask if it's ok before they put their arm around the shoulder or try to hold hands with a girl. He wasn't an asshole. Some of his points were even fair, but I wanted to burn the world down over it. I can't enjoy the TV Shows I like anymore. My boyfriend and I love Impractical Jokers, but I recently found out that half of them have been predatory towards minor girls and at least one of them was accused of sexual assault, and now I feel sick watching it. We both love Nathan for You, but there was a sexist joke (not by Nathan) in the episode last night, and it ruined it for me. Every tv show I watch insults women in some way. All of a sudden, I feel like my eyes are open and I'm realizing how normalized sexism has become.

I used to have patience with my male clients who displayed indicators of being sexist, focusing on education and helping them to better understand the prospective of women, because most of the time (at least with my clients) it comes from a place of ignorance or pain, and can be resolved with education. But now, I'm pissed off. For example, before this, when it became clear that a client's girlfriend does not enjoy having sex with him, I focused on education, teaching him about female pleasure, consent, the importance of connection, ensuring that she receives three times as many nonsexual touches than she does sexual touches, etc... but now, when I hear about a 35 year old man in a 4 year relationship who doesn't know where the fucking clit is, I want to scream into the void and hang up on him. (Obviously, I do neither of these things). But my boyfriend pointed out that I have been audibly been saying multiple times a day, ""I hate men"". I didn't even notice I was doing it.

I think that I genuinely hate most men now. I hate strangers. I hate the men I love. I hate all of them. It makes me sad and scared.. but I'm also unwilling to continue pretending to laugh at jokes I don't think are funny, accepting the bulk of the emotional labor of relationships, tolerating small sexist comments (for example, *anytime* my male best friend talks about how good his boss is at her job, he ALWAYS mentions how small she is and how no one would ever guess how smart and tough she is. I never *liked* it when he said things like that, but now, I haven't spoken to him in three days, and I caught myself seriously considering *ending a 5 year friendship over it*.

I feel at a loss. I don't know what to do. I don't even know what I *want* to do, but I can feel myself being radicalized, I can feel myself becoming an angry person. I don't want this to be my life- but I also refuse to accept less because I'm a woman. Is there a way for me to stop placating men and still have them in my life? Will they accept this new me who doesn't pretend anymore, or will I slowly lose everyone I love? The only way I know how to stop the radicalization of myself is to start being authentic about who I am and how I feel. I'm angry, I'm hurt, and I'm tired of listening to men talk about how shocked they are that their 5'2 98lb boss is good at her fucking job.

I don't know if I'm asking for help or validation or a wake-up call that I'm unwell. I don't know what to do.

I think I hate men, and I hate being a woman. I'm really sad.

**Update:** First, thank you so much. I was in a really bad place yesterday. I felt numb and empty and hopeless, and this morning I'm full of hope. I've realized that I don't hate men. I'm scared of men. I don't want them to hurt me or my sisters anymore, and I don't know how to protect myself from them. That constant fear turned into anger and then resentment and then contempt. When I posted yesterday, I just wanted someone to tell me that I wasn't losing my mind, and I am *so thankful* for all the kind words, validation, thoughtful questions, gentle challenges, and constructive criticism. I have made notes of all of the resources and advice, and I'm starting my healing journey today.

My boyfriend saw my post on the front page of Reddit and immediately knew it was me. He wasn't angry, he was supportive. He also said that he'd always wanted the experience of randomly reading about himself on Reddit haha. He's a good egg, and I'm very grateful to have him as my life partner.

Today, I am starting a week detox from all social media to reset my brain. I also called my therapist, and we're going to meet twice a week until I feel more myself.

I have taken a vacation from work, and will be transitioning away from triggering clients. I don't know if it's for now, or forever, but that's a decision for another day.

My boyfriend will be monitoring my Reddit account and sharing your kind words, but please don't misinterpret my lack of response as a lack of gratitude. I just need a break for a bit.

I have a long list of recommended books, movies, documentaries, and lectures to dive into tomorrow. But for today, I intend to watch Critical Role in my pajamas with the people I love.

Thank you again.

To the man who pulled me aside while my friends talked to yours,"Thank you. You pulled me aside and let me know that your friends were bad people planning bad things to do to girls. You put your arm around me like you were making a move and told me quietly that if I was feeling unsafe with them, I should leave now. That they were all fucked up on Molly and other drugs. That they were just kicked from two bars for fights and being too fucked up. That they would try and pressure my roommate into stuff she wouldn't want to do (as I saw them trying to do so). Told his friends to leave me alone and let me talk to her (as they kept trying to keep me and her away from each other). Told my roommate that he was afraid for her and she needed to leave with me. Shook my hand and gave me a hug and told me to get home safely and then walked off with his friends, telling them they are dicks. His friends were assholes to him the whole time. Whoever you are mark, I hope you find better friends because you deserve better friends. I felt so validated and respected as a person and as a woman that he understood my uncomfortableness, understood the danger to me and my friend and helped us to get to a better situation (as at this point the guys were pressuring her to go to their place and do... Graphic acts that she kept saying no to and had followed us back to her car).

"I was almost taken/trafficked in Austin, Tx","This is the most traumatizing thing that's ever happened to me. I have never told most people about this and I want to get the word out to other women about how easily this can happen, how quickly you can be caught off guard, and how even safe places can have predators. 

It was terrifyingly similar to the actual movie Taken, but it happened in Austin, Tx. There is a very popular bar district downtown here, it's like a strip and super busy with college kids. I was 21 years old and I was out with my husband and 4 of his friends (all guys). So it was me and 5 decent sized men and this still happened. 

We were all out drinking and having a great time. I had stopped on the busy street in front of one of the bars to talk to a door guy I knew, and my husband and the guys walked off in front of me. I had just said bye to the door guy and I was trailing behind the guys by about 15 feet. I was noticeably drunk, I was stumbling a bit. I'm a small woman, 90 lbs. Suddenly a car pulls over next to me and rolls down the window, it's a charismatic and good-looking guy in his 20s. He goes ""Hey! I'm your uber! Get in"" and unlocks the door. I looked over and felt ever-so-slightly off and went ""No, I didn't call an uber"" and kept walking. The car started rolling along next to me and the guy is saying through the window ""No you didn't call, your friend called. We're here to pick you up. Get in."" And I stopped walking, for the slightest second, and glanced to the car with a funny face. By that point I knew it was weird. It was already happening so fast, maybe 20 seconds went by so far. As soon as my eyes landed on the car, the driver turned to the backseat and said something fast in another language. The backdoor flies open and there are 2 other guys sitting there, about his same age, and they are all eastern-european (maybe greek?) with accents.  My eyes went wide and the guys lunged forward, grabbed me by the waist and yanked me into the car. I was gone and in the car in under a second. I screamed in the loudest, most blood curdling way I could muster, NOOOOOOOO. My husband's best friend about 15 feet ahead hears me first, stops dead in his tracks and starts bolting towards me. The driver starts driving right away and the guys in the back try slamming the door behind me.

They had my wrists but I stuck my leg between the car and the door right before he tried to slam it, so it bounced off my leg and my husband's best friend grabs the door. Then they  pulled my leg in and were able to shut the door and lock it. 

I'm screaming, they're driving away. The rest of my group is running to us, the bouncer we were in front of comes running to me, and him and husband's best friend run after the car a few feet and yank me out of the still open window by my arms, while the car is still moving.  I'm still screaming and kicking. On my way out of the car I kick the driver in the chest. They sped away, turned and were gone.

I'm crying. My husband is crying. The bouncer calls the police to report it. It's a whole scene. I left immediately, I rushed home in a panic and didn't stay around for the report. Don't know if anything ever happened with it. I never gave them my information. I was honestly so traumatized and in a state of shock that I never did anything or told anyone else. My friends that were with me (and my husband primarily) struggled with tremendous guilt for a long time. Nobody felt like they reacted fast enough, or harsh enough, or just that they let me lag behind at all. It changed all of us forever and I'm still terrified of being anywhere alone and of being taken. 

I was 21 and I was basically kidnapped. There were a few seconds I was completely locked in the car and they were driving off, holding me tightly and restraining my limbs. They were talking a foreign language and I knew in that moment 100% that I would be trafficked and thought it would be the last time I ever saw my husband or my friends. 

It was a perfectly normal night in a well-lit, busy, decent area of town and I was with a group of men who would've protected me. And they pounced on me immediately because they thought I was alone. 

Be extremely wary of cab drivers and people claiming they are uber and lyft when you are out. Always confirm on the app that someone is your driver, and never stand too close to cars when you are on the sidewalk. I know that last one may seem paranoid, but if you are in a vulnerable position (I was drunk, dressed sexy, seemingly alone outside of a club), you need to be extremely wary of your surroundings and how quickly the unexpected can happen. 

Please be careful. Please be safe. Please report anything suspicious. Be vigilant. ",TwoXChromosomes,25966,1532737042.0,1909,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/92hu6m/i_was_almost_takentrafficked_in_austin_tx/
Why do guys think women are OBLIGATED to talk to them in public?,"Went to the laundromat this morning, sweaty and bothered, I’m having a rough pms. Dude pulls up next to me in a bright orange jeep. He gets out and he’s wearing matching bright orange shorts and flip flops. Honestly I give him props for having a favorite color and sticking to it. I barely notice him. 

I sit in my car and watch videos on my phone and wait for my laundry to be done. As my timer gets close I gather my stuff, I look up and realize this dude is leaning on his car directly in front of my driver side door. He’s on his phone too but I’m sketched that he’s choosing to be right in my way. My windows aren’t tinted so I waved to show him that I’m about to open my door. Of course he moves just enough for me to open the door. I squeeze out. 

“Yo, Im still going to need to get by you.” I pointed to the door behind him, my tone was not friendly.

“Wait, Ive been wanting to talk to you.” He was giving me a weird smirk and not wearing a mask. 

“Well that was a dumb fucking plan. Block my way so I will talk to you? Fuck you dude.” I started walking to the other side of the car and he ran ahead to the laundromat door to hold it for me. 

“C’mon, I just want to chat with you. Why are you being angry like that?” He leaned close to me when I went through the door. 

“No! You’re really pissing me the fuck off. Just leave me alone. I’m not going to tell you again!”

He shut up when I raised my voice and other people in the laundromat started to listen in and give him a dirty look. 

I told a female attendant about him and pointed to him and she took down his license and said if he comes in she will kick him out. Honestly I was really happy with her response. Fuck dudes who corner women because “I want to talk to you”. I don’t give a fuck whatever you have to say. I WILL make a scene.

Already got an angy boi in my DMS:

Private message from u/smithsmiths: “FYI most guys don't think women are obligated to speak to them. Before you go off on a rant about how ""nOt aLl men"" is a bad argument, that's the same logic racists use to discriminate against certain groups of people.” 

My response: “Here’s the deal. Racism is a system of oppression against people of color. Just like sexism is a system of oppression against women. So you saying “most guys don’t” is like telling me “All lives matter” in response to “black lives matter” it’s an inherently sexist response. Women cannot oppress men. Women live everyday in opposition to a system that has created and routinely supported harassment/sexualization/discrimination of women. So yea. Get fucked and leave women alone.”

PSA: Addressing the most ‘triggering’ phrase: I’m talking about *systemic* oppression when I say women cannot oppress men. You can’t be the oppressors in a system you don’t hold power in. Men can definitely be victims of sexual assault, abuse etc by women/by men. A system built by cis men harms women and LGBTQ the most, then other men but don’t worry we’re gonna fix it - it’s just slow work.

A man threatened to shoot me because I declined his advances,"This happened last night, and I am still shocked and upset.

I \[36F\] am travelling for work in a southern beach town, and I stayed an extra night for a little bit of R&amp;R that only the beach can offer! I decided to take myself out to a nice seafood dinner to celebrate a big work win earlier in the day. I take myself out to dinner often - I have zero issue sitting at a table by myself, ordering what I want, and playing on my phone. 

Other people sometimes have an issue with it, particularly men. They view it as an opportunity to hit on me, talk to me....etc... Sometimes it becomes an issue, sometimes it doesn't. Well, tonight it became a big issue.

I am having a great time eating my oysters and watching Legally Blonde on my phone - when I hear over my headphones a man with large party loudly talking about how '16 or 17 wasn't so bad' and being greeted with laughter. I take out my headphones and hear him going on and on about trying to have sex with a young girl and how '16 or 17 isn't so bad'

I was mortified that there were women sitting at this table, laughing along with him. Everyone was laughing along with him. I mean, I was raised in the south (I don't live there now) but I have obviously forgotten how bad things are down here. 

So at this time I also see people from the table glancing and looking at me. Great. They probably realized I was judging them for their comments. Finally, a man gets up and walks over to my table and sits down with me.

He says, ""I just had to come over here""

Me: ""Why?""

Him: ""Because I'm single. I wanted to come talk to you.""

Me: ""Oh, I overheard you guys talking about having sex with 16 and 17 years olds, I'm not interested.""

A shadow crossed this mans face, and he glared at me and stood up. (I would like to point out that he did literally nothing to defend himself. Like - I would assume that someone who did not engage in that conversation would be confused and defensive?) He walks back over to his table and yells ""She is a fucking bitch! She said we want to fuck children! I'm going to shoot her in the fucking face!"" And storms out of the restaurant.

Thankfully there were two men on a date at the table right beside me, and they checked on me to see if I was OK. The manager eventually came over to check on me too, but then he didn't do anything. He didn't ask the table to leave, or offer to safely get me to my ride. 

Eventually, another waitress came over and said that table wanted to buy me a drink. I told her ""You've got to be kidding right? Absolutely not.""

I have eaten by myself in Vegas, LA, Detroit, and huge cities all over the country - and I have never felt more unsafe than I did as a solo woman dining alone in the south. I'm not coming back anytime soon.

EDIT:
Thanks so much for all of the wonderful support. You all are the best. I appreciate all the suggestions that I should have called the police, and I honestly didn’t think of it. I was actually pretty scared, because the table kept glaring at me after he left. I called an Uber and it took 15 minutes to arrive. I hated that they kept looking at me, and it was making me really uncomfortable, but I also knew better than to wait outside. Hopefully this doesn’t happen again, but if it does I will now remember that!

As far as people defending the south in this thread. Oof. I’m not here to offend people. If you know, you know. That’s it.",TwoXChromosomes,10930,1649505110.0,622,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/tzrmfq/a_man_threatened_to_shoot_me_because_i_declined/
The guy who raped me (more than once at College) contacted me to apologise. Not sure what to make of the conversation. (TW: discussion of rape),"
This is still somewhat surreal even though this was a few years ago. This was the message that I recieved from the guy who raped me (more than once) at college:



Hi,

I sincerely hope that life is treating you well and you are feeling good.

I hope this message isn’t an intrusion on your happiness. But, fuck, I miss you like crazy. 

I understand that I was a special sort of Cunt.

I know that I don’t even warrant a thought. But I think of you often. I realise that my behaviour was beyond reprehensible. I just wish that I still knew you.

Feel free to ignore this.

I just turned 25 and know I still think about you daily and wish I had done the right thing for you and by you.

I hope you have the best of everything and are happy.

AGAIN!!! Feel free to ignore this and feel no way. This message is no doubt all about me.

Stay beautiful and powerful.

Faithfully,
M




The message made me feel sick (especially the choice of words intrusion and powerful). I’d suppressed what had happened up until that point. I didn’t reply until a few years later. 

He responded immediately and expressed remorse. However, I’m not sure about other sections of the conversation and not sure how I feel about them. So I’ve included the entire conversation (which is the reason this post is so horrifically long). I just wondered whether anyone could cast their eye over it and give me their opinion. Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this. 

To provide context. This is what he actually did to me at college (the stage before university in the UK):

We were part of a friendship group of three very close best friends. I was a people-pleaser, incredibly shy. A girly girl. M the guy who raped me was the kind of kid your parents tell you not to hang around with because they’re bad news. However, he was popular, confident and very witty. C was the opposite; a computer nerd. Who lived for World of Warcraft. He was very socially awkward and didn’t like people very much particularly women.

No one could understand why we were friends as we didn’t match. But there is some kind of magnetic pull between people with high levels of childhood trauma. We were dubbed by ‘the 3 musketeers’ by other students and it wasn’t long before the teachers referred to us in the same way.

Initially everything was amazing. I’d never had a friend more in tune with me than M. He was one of those friends who could tell how you were feeling by looking at you. He was initially incredibly receptive to my needs, very kind and caring. Which was a breath of fresh air as I had a very dysfunctional and abusive home life (as did he), had been bullied at secondary school and had no real friends. 

But after some time M started to show a romantic intrest in me which I didn’t take well and wasn’t reciprocated. My lack of reciprocated intrest lead him to start mistreating me. Some days he would be nice to me others he would give me the silent treatment or say unkind things. I never knew what mood he’d be in. 

SA was sadly normalised at college. He’d previously slapped my bum, pulled me onto his lap, put his hands up my top, but his behavior wasn’t too different from other boys at college and it was passed off as banter. So it didn’t set the alarm bells off that it should have. The first time I become consciously wary of him he blew up at me at the college Christmas party because I’d talked to another guy. When I reminded him he wasn’t my boyfriend he threw me against some railings. 

The first time he raped me was about a year and a half into our friendship. We were at his house which wasn’t unusual. But this time C hadn’t turned up. We’d drunk a lot of vodka and Fanta fruit twist. I didn’t hold my alcohol as well as he did so I went to bed. I awoke to him in the bed with me with his hands in my underwear. 

There was a struggle between us. I tried to reason with him. I told him that we weren’t going to have sex to which he replied “how about this?” “If I can get it in I win”. M was 6’3 and about double my weight so he won. After he’d finished to further humiliate me he said “you’re mine now. I can see my cum coming out of you”. Even though what happen had devastated me I didn’t call it rape. I hadn’t fought hard enough, I blamed myself. 

The next time I saw him he’d told everyone at college. I felt physically sick and humiliated. He was adamant we were now a couple. When I challenged this narrative he got angry and held me against a wall and shoved his tounge down my throat. Thankfully another student saw and asked me if I was okay and he stopped. 

Not long after that he followed me home. I told him to leave me alone but he said he wouldn’t until I talked to him. He was insistent that we were now a couple. I was insistent that we weren’t. The conversation went nowhere. When I arrived home and opened the door. Rather than walk away he pushed his way into my house. “My mums home so you need to go” I said “no she’s not she’s never home at this time?” He replied. 

He didn’t waste time in pulling me into my bedroom. At this point it dawned on me that he was probably going to rape me. I kept begging him to stop “please let’s just talk” “please don’t do this”. I tried to get passed him but he grabbed me, pushed me down onto my bed and raped me. When he was finished he stood over me smiling as I lay there in shock and disbelief “Thanks that was hot” pushed a cigarette behind his ear and walked out.  

The last time he raped me was about a year later at the prom after party at one of my new friends houses. Eveyone had turned up. By this point we weren’t friends (had new friendship groups) and we didn’t talk. He had failed his exams and was doing an intensive course. I was finishing my last year. If we bumped into one another in the corridor he would often stare at me to make me feel uncomfortable. Sometimes he would skowl at me. 

Anyway, stupidly I drank too much and went upstairs to my friends room and fell asleep. I woke up face down to him raping me. I froze. I know it was M because I could see his watch. I didn’t say anything, I didn’t move, I was just frozen. When he was done he removed an orange durex wrapper from the bedside table pulled my underwear up. Put my dress back down and left the room. 

A few years later it all came up again when I watched the 13 reasons why series. M was the real life Bryce Walker. Jessica’s rape in particular hit me hard. It was like watching my own story! It confirmed that what he’d done to me was terribly wrong and wasn’t my fault. C had blamed me, minimised it and I’d believed him.

I had an overwhelming desire to confront M. So, I drank a few glasses of wine, took a deep breath and replied to his message.

This is the entire conversation between my rapist and I:




Me: Hi, When you messaged me I wasn’t really ready to speak to you if I’m honest. It took me a long time to even be able to open the message. I wasn’t anywhere near ready to face everything that went on when we were at college. But recently that has changed for several reasons and now I’m ready to talk. Will await your reply.

Him: Hi thanks for the message. Am I allowed to ask what has bought this on?

Me: Well, since you messaged me it opened up negative feelings and emotions I had buried. However, the catalyst came when I watched the series 13 reasons why and I actually had to switch it off mid episode because it was too close to home (I don’t know if you’ve seen it). You betrayed me horrifically. What you did to me has affected me greatly and made me feel like absolute shit for so long. 

Him: I probably would have switched it off for the same reason. Before anything else. I definitely owe you an apology. It doesn't mean anything, really. But, I know that I conducted myself in a manner that was outright disgusting. Nothing can atone and nothing can take it back- I still look back with a great sense of shame and disappointment. 

What was an amazing friendship turned dark and that was all on me. I carry the guilt with me. I have been wanting to speak to you for a long time, but I did not want to provoke any negative memories. So I am grateful you got in contact. You didn't owe me that kindness. I am honestly so sorry and I don’t deserve it but you have done my mental health a service today by contacting me.

Me: Thank you for being so honest it means a lot. What made you message me?

Him: I was trying to reach out you taught me so much without even realising. You still look exactly the same btw it’s nuts. Even though a lot of my backstory was fabricated - it makes no difference to the fun times we all had together

Me: thanks. What do you mean fabricated? 

Him: L we were so young. It’s such a shame. It was the best time of my fucking life up until it all went to shit. Fucking all-nighters and last minute parties. C falling out that ground floor window (I’m still convinced you pushed him 😉), C off his face fighting lampposts and smashing his glasses, J setting his shoe on fire in your bedroom. Do you remember all that? 🤣🤣🤣

Me: Yes I remember it all. Like an extended  episode of Skins. For the record I didn’t push him I was just standing near him.  What do you mean by fabricated? 

Him: Yeah I belive you 😉 I’m sure they based that TV show on us!

Me: I’m pretty sure it came out a good few years before we met. Yes it’s a shame those fun memories were ruined. I don’t really like thinking about that time now. 

Just the final thing I wanted to ask. Kind of a closure thing. Why did you do that to me? I didn’t consent. Sex without consent is rape. I’m sure I don’t have to explain that to you. I understand it’s probably a bit of a hard question to answer but it would be really helpful to me.

Him: You are welcome to get whatever answers you want from me. There’s no reason for what I did to you. I was unhealthily obsessed with you. No 2 ways about it. A 17-18 year old messed up kid with a lack of self awareness. The relativity of consequences just didn't exist at that point. I didn’t respect your wishes or boundaries I just acted like a fucking cunt. I was an absolute twat and arsehole of the highest order. And you never deserved ANY of it. 

If you take anything away- understand I know exactly what I done to you and how it made you feel. I also know exactly what it cost me. My mental health isn’t the best and has been a lot worse since. It isn’t much of an answer but it’s all I can give. I guess I will find the answers in Hell.

Me: thanks I don’t really know what to say. This is pretty heavy 

Him: yes pretty intense. Just know it’s a great source of shame and embarrassment and the guilt is my burden to bear forever. Well, now, anyway. When I messaged you before I also took the hint and know you didn't owe me a chance to apologise. So I am glad you provided me the opportunity. Thank you.

Me: I spoke with C about this recently. I don’t know if you’re aware but we maintained a friendship after college though it’s been fraught at times. Mainly because of what happened and the fact he fought your corner and not mine. But he’s come to a stage now where he’s realised his response to what happened was wrong. 

C confessed to me that there was some kind of agreement that you were both interested in me and you'd agreed to 'let the best man win' This was unbelievably hurtful to hear as I thought the friendship was genuine. That I was some kind of game between you both. It's objectifying and dehumanising.

Him: Wtf? Just for the record... there was no ""let the best man win"" competition. 

Me: Why would he make that up?

Him: I honestly don't know why C would say that. Probably in an attempt to further villainise me (not that needed to happen)
I'm already a complete an utter peice of shit and beyond for my previous actions

Me: I don’t know what to believe 

Him: It's OK. He always has been a little snakey. I'm struggling to see what he had to gain from that. He knew I always liked you.
I had no idea that there was a
""competition"" because he also liked you...

I just want you to know since everything happened, I haven't been able to get close to anyone (friendship). Haven't even been able to maintain any kind of social bond. Everything has been superficial. I knew what I done was wrong. I knew I had no right to feel sorry for myself, I knew that whatever negative shit I was going through was well deserved. Well I went through a phase where I couldn't stand to be sober. I'd be drunk or high... both. I'd do drugs and other stupid shit - bollocks to the consequences.

I'm not looking for sympathy, or understanding. Fuck, even talking to you know makes my chest hurt. The remorse is crushing and I have absolutely no fucking right for you to even read what I say. The gratitude I feel being able to express my regret and offer an apology is immense. 

Me: I’m sorry you went through that. I hope things are better for you now. 

Him: I'm still a little shocked about the news with C. Would explain why he hasn’t spoken to me in a while. But anyway fuck him. 

After I sent you that message and you didn’t reply. I blocked your profile for a while so I couldn’t look at it  - nothing personal, it just hurt a bit, seeing you. Luckily I unblocked you not to long ago. So you were able to send me this message. You can have my phone number. Feel free to get at me any time. I heard you got engaged. Are you married yet or what?!

Me: we’re getting married this summer. 

Him: Congratulations!!! Even though your life is about to change in the biggest of ways and despite your previous experience of me being a terrible person; who I am now is entirely different and I may be able to offer you support or advice. I have 2 kids now. I imagine you will want kids? 

Me: yes we want children 

Him: don’t have them! Pregnancy and childbirth are horrific. And kids are ungrateful tiring little shits (partly joking about that).. since having our first my Mrs won’t go anywhere near me. The only time she wanted it was when she wanted to get pregnant. Anyway that’s another story. Have you seen my daughter? 

Me: wow okay. yes she’s gorgeous 

Him: notice anything? 

Me: she’s incredibly cute 

Him: yes but she’s literally my twin. Come on? Keep up! 🙃

Me: yes she does look like you 

Him: Anyway i’m not expecting us to be besties, I'm not expecting us to ever talk again, really- just support you and provide information.

Me: sorry I can’t. Too much has happened. I forgive you but the friendship ended the minute you did that to me. It doesnt feel right. I can’t pretend what happened didn’t happen. 

Him: I will save you the trouble of looking at my profile again by blocking you so I don’t pop up in your friends list. Im not pretending that shit was OK- because it wasn't, isn't and never will be. I won’t contact you again. I will leave my number if you have any other questions. 

Thank you for being my friend.

Thank you for being a good person.

I am sorry that you met me and that I hurt you the way I did.

I sincerely wish you the best in life. 

Me: I don’t hate you. Thank you for replying. Thank you for being honest. I don’t think most people would have.

Him: I will delete this conversation on my end, I don’t want to ever look at it again but, I will still be available to contact- by phone just in case in the future you are able to talk to me again. I can't NOT hate myself for what I did, L. I have a lot to love myself for too, but, I would be dishonest in “forgetting"" what I did. We're all human. I sincerely wish you the best in life. I’m sorry 



My head is scrambled. I believe this is a confession. He expressed remorse yet at points I didn’t feel like he wasn’t taking it as seriously as he should have and said some things that were inappropriate and insensitive. 

I’m grateful that I got some closure and remorse I know most victims don’t and I’m grateful for that but it still doesn’t feel right. 

Any thoughts I’d be very grateful for. 

Edit: Thank you so much for all the people who have taken time not only to read this as it’s so long but to leave comments. It’s given me such clarity and I now have a perfect understanding of why it all felt so wrong. I hesitated for some time before posting here but this is the best thing I’ve done. I just wish I’d posted before I messaged him. 

My main takeaways are he is a highly disordered, dangerous person and I need to protect myself at all costs. I also need to start therapy. I now have enough evidence to gain advice from a lawyer.

I'd like to leave this here... How To Protect Yourself From False Rape Allegations,"How To Protect Yourself From False Rape Allegations--
 (credit to @DanielleMuscato on Twitter/insta/patreon and u/DanielleMuscato on reddit) 

I'm seeing a lot of scared men right now. My heart aches for you. I get it: You're just trying to go about your day when in a mere instant, your whole life could be turned upside down. It's a scary world—you could lose everything, just because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time.

With that in mind, I present my Top 10 Tips for Staying Safe from false rape accusations:

1. If you go to a party, either have only one drink, or only drink soda or water, so you can keep your wits about you. Never get tipsy around people you don't know and trust fully—it could come back to haunt you later. Even around people you fully trust, remember that most false rape allegations come from people you know. Be vigilant!

2. Use the buddy system, so you always have a witness! Only go to the bathroom with a friend, or ideally with a group of friends. Always have a friend walk you to your car, in case you run into a strange woman in the parking garage. Never go camping or hiking or biking or running or even just walking alone. NEVER go to a bar or concert or party or event alone; that is just asking for it.

3. If you're going out anywhere, make sure you text the specifics of your plans to at least one or two trusted friends, in case they need to verify your whereabouts to police later. You may also consider using a location sharing app so you have proof of where you were and when.

4. If you're going to exercise, make sure that you bring a friend, or even better, just exercise at home. Never go through a park alone. There might be a woman there who could accuse you.

5. When you're heading to class or work, never listen to music or podcasts on headphones. You need to listen carefully to your surroundings to make sure no woman is accusing you of anything.

6. When you're getting into your car at the end of the day, always check your backseat to make sure there aren't any women hiding back there. Never take shortcuts through alleys or parking lots that aren't extremely well lit, in case a woman is hiding there, waiting to accuse you.

7. Only take out the trash, walk the dog, get your mail, go to the ATM, or get gas during daylight hours. Most false rape accusations happen at night, and you don't want to become a statistic. If you MUST go out alone at night, make sure to get your phone out of your pocket and start recording video. Grasp the phone between your fingers so it's not obvious, but keep it ready in case a strange woman approaches you.

8. It's expensive to take Uber or Lyft all the time, I know. But never use public transportation after dark. It's just too risky. Indecent exposure and groping accusations are very common on the subway, and you can easily avoid this by simply taking a cab instead. Protect yourself.

9. Never rent ground-floor apartments, and make sure you lock all your windows at night, even if it's hot out. You never know if a woman is going to break into your bedroom to accuse you while you are asleep.

10. Last but not least, even if you follow all these tips, you could still be falsely accused. After all, no matter what steps you take to prevent it, it's simply a fact of life that every year, a low single-digit percentage of rape allegations will turn out to be false, on par with other false allegations of felonies, and that's just a sad truth we all have to live with. You can take precautions, but that's all you can do.
Hope this helps.


-This is clearly satire however it does depict an interesting parallel to what women have been constantly told to prevent being raped, which then tends to put blame on the victim when it does happen.

Edit: fixed weird word bolding

Edit 2: as I've stated to some of the initial comments I am not the author of this piece, I wish I knew who was so I can credit them but when I stumbled upon it (on Facebook) it was reposted as a comment without credit. I just wanted to share because. It's an interesting think piece that might allow for some discussion and parallels to be drawn. The only part I personally wrote was the end to explain its satirical.

Edit 3: the word sarcastic to satire because this post isn't meant to come off as dismissing false rape accusations but is instead a commentary on victim blaming and these exact points being constantly told to women so that they can prevent being raped.

UPDATE:
 AUTHOR FOUND PLEASE GIVE HER ALL THE CREDIT! @DanielleMuscato on Twitter/insta/patreon and u/DanielleMuscato on reddit she did an amazing think piece on Twitter that lead to this post ""what would you do if men had a 9 pm curfew"" and the responses are fascinating! Go check it out give her a follow, she also hosts @RESISTpodcast, and is a civil rights activist so please show her some love!! 

Her message:
I'm the author of the post about how to avoid false allegations, although for some reason I appear to be unable to post on /r/TwoXChromosomes.

As you said, yes, this is clearly satire. The purpose of satire is not to belittle serious problems but to shame society into improving itself. As a civil-rights activist, writer, and public speaker, I do not see satire, aka humor-as-activism, as a negative thing by any stretch, especially when it works.

I got the idea for this post based on responses by thousands of women to a recent tweet of mine that went viral, in which I asked fellow women, as a thought experiment: ""What would you do if all men had a 9pm curfew?"" and imploring men to read the replies and learn something from us. I don't think I'm allowed to link to it directly, but it's easy to find if you google it and currently pinned on my Twitter (my Reddit username is my real name).

I'm glad this has resonated with so many people, both women and men and nonbinary folks. Street harassment, rape, date rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment are overwhelmingly familiar topics to every single woman I know, and sadly, every girl I know, too. Even though these crimes are overwhelmingly committed by men against women, most (straight, cis) men seem to be either completely oblivious to this issue at all, or barely cognizant of it as a real problem.

Things are JUST STARTING to change with #metoo—and now with the Kavanaugh hearings—I feel like we're at the cusp of a very real shift in the way society approaches what is normal and acceptable for courtship, was is normal and acceptable for workplace behavior, and what is normal and acceptable behavior for acquaintances and strangers. We are having a real moment for women's rights and I'm beyond thrilled that men are finally starting to understand the depth and universality of this horrible reality.

I walked out on a date with a guy over COVID.,"I got into a conversation online with a guy and he asked me out for a date to a bar. I agreed under specific terms: it had to be a bar that was following social distancing, outdoor seating with spread out tables, and I wanted to be as far away from anyone else as humanly possible. All seemed fine, he chose the bar as I'm not familiar to the area, I checked online and saw they had a huge outdoor area (think backyard sized) with picnic tables far apart from each other. 

Cue to date night, I get to the bar masked up and he approaches me and goes in for a hug. I backup a few steps and remind him I wanted distance. He seemed disappointed but listened (a little begrudgingly). His mask wasn't all the way over his nose and any attraction I'd had for him basically died right away. We go around the side of the bar to the back and the back area is PACKED. At least 50 people, all in large groups, no one wearing masks. I immediately stop and ask him if he knows somewhere else we can go because I'm not comfortable going anywhere near that cesspool of virus potential. 

He tells me I'm being paranoid and I need to loosen up, it's not cute to guys for a girl to be so uptight. COVID isn't a big deal anyway blah blah blah. I immediately went off (respectfully, wasn't trying to get murdered) and told him about how I had gotten the virus back in March, how painful it was, how scared I had been, how depressing and mentally taxing quarantine had been. I then told him if I couldn't trust him to protect myself, himself, and others from the virus, how could I trust being around him in general? How do I know if we decided to have sex at some point he wouldn't just slip the condom off because there's 'only x chance of getting this STI/STD and it's treatable so what's the big deal'.

Long story short I left and went home and had ice cream. People, being an idiot during a pandemic isn't hot. Of anything it's probably one of my biggest turn offs now. Happily single for the duration of this pandemic it seems.

Edit; holy shit this blew up overnight. To the people offering support thank you, I really appreciate it. To the people saying I'm virtue signalling, or talking about how I shouldn't have even left my house in the first place, the only reason I ever even agreed to go was because 

A. At that time in the area we were living in our cases were at a record low, this was not recent during a spike

B. It is possible to safely interact with new people following CDC guidelines. The reason I agreed to go to the place was because the tables were large, and spaced out by at least 10 feet, and there was supposedly contactless ordering (order and pay on your phone, pick up your order at a drop off window also outside so no need to be indoors at all, and no seeing or interacting with staff members. Whether this was actually what they were doing I don't know because I didn't step foot in the yard area). This place was meant to be safe for a socially distanced meetup which was the intention, and when that turned out to not be the case, I left. 

C. He seemed to have no issues when I told him I wanted to keep my distance and that I had requirements as I haven't been or gone near a restaurant or bar since the pandemic took off back in February-ish. I was explicitly clear that I wouldn't be going near him, or any other person at this time as I had been isolated working from home, and having my groceries delivered so I hadn't even really left my house in months. He seemed okay with all these terms, I'm guessing because he assumed I would just give in and be walked all over cause I was so mentally drained and exhausted from isolating so long. That was not the case sadly for him lmao",TwoXChromosomes,11784,1610686418.0,965,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/kxndn4/i_walked_out_on_a_date_with_a_guy_over_covid/
What I wish I knew about men when I was young: wisdom from a middle-aged woman looking back.,"Here are the things I wish I'd known about men, love, and dating when I was starting out.  I really hope it finds the girls and women that it's meant for. If you struggle with self-esteem and being treated poorly in relationships, please read. This is not a screed against men. I love men. But if you spend too much time with the wrong ones, you will end up hating men. My wish is for every woman in a bad relationship to leave it. I would have recognized my own bad (abusive) relationship for what it was much sooner had I known some of these things to watch for in the beginning.

Also, this is about hetero relationships exclusively because that's all I've ever been in.

1) Every man has an idea of his ideal woman/dream girl and if you are not it, it's never going to work out. This is not about being super hot, perfect, or a 10 on some bullshit scale. It just means that every man has his ""type"" - curvy, nordic, freckly, waifish, dark haired, petite, plus, whatever. It doesn't matter. But they all have a type that they prefer for reasons *they* don't even know. You can be a stunning Swedish model but if his dream girl is Salma Hayek, then it's just not going to work. It's not you. In fact, we all have preferences but men put their preference at the very top of their list. Don't demean yourself by changing your appearance for some man to notice you. Look around for the ones that already notice you.

2) Men try their hardest at the beginning. If he is showing up unwashed and asking for sex on the first date it is already awful and will only get worse. A good man wants to impress you and will work to do so. Just think, if that guy got that date with Salma Hayek somehow, is he going to show up in dirty jeans, try to get her to split the bill, and then demand a blow job? Not a chance. Because he knows that she would walk away and he would have ruined his only opportunity to win her attention. You need to bring this same energy about yourself to every date. Your refusal to accept that type of nonsense works wonders for your self esteem. It also raises your standing in the eyes of good men. You are wasting your one precious life if you stick around for anything less. If you've ever been made to feel guilty about this, please think about the fact that he makes more money for the same job as you, does not spend $100s on makeup, hair, nails, clothes, what have you, to look as good as you do on that date, does not have to carry pepper spray and alert his friends of his whereabouts in case he goes missing, nor do they have to wrestle with the chance of getting pregnant every time they have sex. We all know that there is no 100% fool-proof BC out there, abortions are banned or threatened in many places, and you have no guarantee that this guy is good enough to stick around and raise a child with you. You have already paid, ten-fold, for the date. If he's asking you to do more, it's because you are not his ideal woman and he is trying to squeeze extra value out of you to make up for the fact that you don't have the boobs or face he prefers. Not because your boobs or face are bad, mind you, but because of his ingrained preferences. Oh well. Better to hit that eject button early and move on.

3) There are three types of relationships - a) you are both head over heels for each other; b) he loves you more than you love him; c) you love him more than he loves you. Relationships A and B can work, C never will. Why? Because men will only put in the work of a relationship if they are really crazy in love with you. Women will put in the work regardless. Relationships can't work unless both parties are putting in the work.  If you feel like you are working SO HARD on this relationship and he isn't matching the effort, you are in a C relationship. C your way out.

4) Women do the ""work"" of a relationship no matter where they fall on the spectrum of feelings towards their man. You can be in like with him ('he's nice') to fully head-over-heels in love with him ('I would have his babies today if he asked') and you will still do the work. What is the work? Remembering his likes and dislikes, listening to him and asking questions, compromising, doing things just because they make him smile and not because you get anything in particular out of it, making plans with him first before anyone else, considering him and his needs/desires when making plans with others (i.e. - he'll just be getting back in town that night from a long trip, I want to stay in and cook him a romantic dinner because I missed him instead of doing a girl's night). If this doesn't sound like work to you but just a regular relationship, that's because you are a woman and we do this automatically. Men will ONLY EVER put this work in for their ideal woman. If the relational work is not being reciprocated then you've got your red flags and are cleared for departure.

5) Most importantly, to a man, ANY WOMAN is better than NO WOMAN. Women bring immeasurable value to a man's life through our physical, emotional, intellectual, and sexual labor. Yes, it is all labor. They could pay separate people to cook, clean, manage, parent, and have sex with them OR they can have a girlfriend. Girlfriends are free and, for a lot of men, require very little relational upkeep. Have you ever found yourself in a relationship  with a man who seemingly despises you but chases after you whenever you try to leave? Or only gives the barest minimum but then a grand gesture to keep you when he senses you drifiting away? If that's the case then you are the ""any woman"" that he's keeping around until he finds THE woman. Don't be a placeholder in someone's life. This is your life. And you are pouring your energy and time into a bucket with a giant hole in the bottom. 

6) You will never find a good man by catering to men. A good man will find you when you are catering to yourself. Ultimately, this is your life and it is for you alone until and unless you find someone who actually makes it even better. It was never meant to be lived in devotion to another person. If you are functioning a lot in your relationship, drop the rope. Don't cook, clean, or caretake (ever, unless you love doing it) just because you are dating him. In fact, you will find out quite quickly where you stand if you stop supplying all of that extra labor. Your energy is meant to be spent on you - shower yourself with your money, delicious food, gorgeous home, extra time, whatever it may be that you create and generate. If he really wants you because you are his dream woman, you will know. He will work to earn your time and attention. It will be crystal clear that you are loved and adored. You will feel safe. You will feel heard. You will be fully yourself and cherished for it. You are worth all of this.

My husband was horrible during my labor. I still haven’t recovered from it. I don’t know if I can continue this marriage.,"First of all thank you anybody who reads this. I made this account but didn’t have the strength to post in the first time. I have a hard time getting anything done these days, I have severe postpartum depression. I am really sorry, English is not my first language so I apologize for the mistakes.

To the point: My husband who I thought I loved very much was a horrible, cruel, childish version of himself when I was in labor. I had a mean male nurse who was clearly the leading one of nurses I was almost afraid of and I specifically asked him to please not leave me, because I was afraid that if he is not there to support me the nurse will refuse to call the doctor and give me anesthesia enough early. It’s exactly what happened and I had to give birth without anesthesia. He told me he is tired and he had to go take a nap and eat something. Fine, but I couldn’t eat or sleep either. I was in pain giving birth to our child. Why do you leave me? Why wouldn’t you support me when you \_knew\_ I didn’t feel comfortable alone, speaking the language I don’t know perfectly, when everyone I love are on other country except you? Whole time when I was dilating he was complaining , snapping at me, asking pain meds from the nurses for himself…

What really hurt me was after the birth. I had a very difficult labor, very long and hard one. When I was laying there my pussy cut open up to my anus and being ripped apart from the vacuum he asked the doctor if when stiching me up they could make one “plus stitch” and made a gesture for vaginal tightness.  I was there, apparently not humiliated, tortured and tired enough, he had to let everyone know how my pussy is now ruined and it must be tighter. Maybe that I have never been tight enough for him. I’m there, destroyed, and he thinks of his dick. The female doctor looked at me, saw that I was crying again (I was crying on-off), looked at him and firmly said that she is going to act like she didn’t heard that inappropriate comment.

This happened in summer and I still don’t feel alright. My mother keeps telling me it’s my postpartum brain that is blowing everything out of proportion. I’m too ashamed to tell my friends who think everything is going great here. I feel like something broke inside of me that day. I don’t know if I love him or want to continue with him. We have fougth over and over, he has apologized a million times. Asks me, am I not allowed to have one bad day? I was tired too.

He has talked about another child. I can not give birth again with someone who left me feeling completely unsafe. He didn’t take care of me the one time I really needed someone to take care of me and when I was vulnerable.

I don’t have any friends here and I’m alone every day all day. I don’t want to divorce and do that to my son, at the same time I don’t want to continue this. I’m so miserable I’ve had horrible thoughts. I left everything to be with him in another country and now it’s ruined.

I feel like I’m trapped.

Edit: Hello everyone thank you very much for your help, I wish I had the time to reply everyone. Unfortunately I can't.  I have received lots and lots of good advice. Your kind words really warm your heart. Sometimes when you're alone in the dark, kind words, no matter if they are written on  a screen or said to you can light a little lamp that shows you part of the path.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on a game plan. I will try to contact facebook groups and ask if any one wants to be my friend. I will tell my own friends how bad I am doing. It's really hard but you just have to do it. I'm going to ask if I can use the car to have appointments with a doctor about my depression more often or go to therapist. I'm also thinking about writing a letter to my husband, telling everything. We haven spoken a million times, but maybe telling just how I felt, without ""attacking"" makes him understand me better.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you. I wish everything gets better. I feel so hopeless somehow. Maybe there is a way. Every person who wrote me, I read you messages and it meant a lot to me.

EDIT 2: I haven't had the chance to start putting my game plan to action. I'm working on it.

I've received lots of support. I've read a lot of amazing PMs and messages, very touching, uplifting, kind, women and men telling their stories, some very heartbreaking stories. I would have never imagined in my life how many women have heard the stitch ""joke"", or the worst, most horrible thing, HAD the stitch done to them. I also received messages from women who had given birth in their husbands country, in a different culture, speaking a language they don't master properly and their husbands letting them down. It's hard to understand how deeply stressful it is if you haven't experienced it.

I've received lots of abuse. I don't care about that, so don't bother.

Now to the other type of messages: I am not asking if I am ""over reacting"" or ""blowing this out of proportion"" what comes to what happened that day. Me being depressed doesn't make me insane or so stupid that I am not able to make conclusions of my own experiences. I'm not asking if the most horrible, traumatizing painful experience of my life is valid or not. I am not asking if his behavior was acceptable or understanble. It wasn't. That's the end of it. What I am trying to figure out, is can you continue living with someone who has betrayed you. When you feel like you don't feel safe with your husband or that you can't trust him to be there for your in the hardest time, it's not something you can just forget. I still have nightmares of what happened. The experience was so terrifying I hallucinated.

About the stitch: apparently joking about the so called the stitch is so popular that it's a cliche. I didn't know that. Maybe that explains the wave of people shaming me for not taking a joke or how apparently ""the"" stitch joke is so popular it's a cliche.

It's the single most hurtful and disrespectful thing I've ever heard. I've received PMs that telling me that I am definitely not the only one feeling that way. It's vile and disrespectful.

**Adult men are not idiotic children that should be given pass to say things they saw ""in the movies"" as in they couldn't possible understand why it would be hurtful to their loved ones who are being  sewed up to stitch back her cut open and teared most intimate body parts. Men are not drooling idiots who are allowed to lack basic human empathy.**

These men telling me how they made the stitch joke too and to get over it,. Would they be so understanding if only their wives made a humiliating joke about the size of his penis in front of his friends? I doubt that. Now, what about if those same men read a Reddit post from a husband who told how abusive his wife was during an extremely painful surgery he was doing for her benefit too? I mean, most men would lose their minds having sharp objects approaching their genitals, but their balls being cut open in a way that they still couldn't take a painless shit or have painless, pleasurable sex after several months and their wife wanting to add unnecessary suffering to that for her sexual pleasure? That wife would be seen as a psycho, not some silly little girl.

The amount of people who are defending my husband's behavior stuns me. Somehow all the replies I've received are very eye opening. It stuns me how little some people expect from men, how much we expect from women and women aren't apparently allowed to express how horrible childbirth is. I have a hard time understanding the men telling me to ""put my big girl pants on"" since women have been giving birth since the dawn of time. Yes we did, and dying in that process used to be a norm. If American culture thinks that the stitch joke is funny or acceptable, it's the culture that needs to change, not the women who feel it's horrible thing to say.

I'm ranting about the stitch, but whatever. I don't really have the energy to start explaining everything else, every little detail and opening up the situation. My mind is racing so much I feel a bit scared, but then again I've been nothing but unwell for so long I don't remember anything else, anyway I'm taking a little break from Reddit right now. I've received lots of good advice I am thinking on. After I leave this computer I will take action to make something out of this situation. First thing is to discuss the most important points with my husband. I'm calling my dad right now.",TwoXChromosomes,16784,1546089639.0,1742,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/aal5wl/my_husband_was_horrible_during_my_labor_i_still/
Dating a recently divorced man was a harrowing reminder that weaponized incompetence is the most dangerous tool that the patriarchy wields against women.,"I recently got out of a relationship with a man who was recently divorced, and his framing of the situation was an unfortunate window into the ways that men will shamelessly malign women to avoid facing their own shortcomings. 

To start, he claimed that their separation was due to the irreconcilable issue of his ex-wife never considering the ways in which *she* was in the wrong, such that he became the scapegoat for every issue in the relationship. He maintained this narrative over the span of 8 dates, claiming that the reason he couldn't see his son was because his ex was being petty and wanted to punish him.

After about two months of casually seeing each other — and of him strategically sprinkling in details that painted his ex as the toxic party — I visited his house for a weekend. For context, this was a trip that had been planned for about a week in advance, far from a surprise visit. When I walked in, I was shocked by the state of things. Months and months of moldy dishes were left undone in the sink, his bathroom had clearly not been cleaned in months, and dirty clothes were strewn all about the house. I stepped over some dirty diapers on my way to the bathroom, and slowly felt myself die inside. Did he truly expect me to comfortably stay there? For what was supposed to be a romantic weekend? Not wanting to be judgmental, and since  I was in an awkward position because I had committed to staying the night, I made an offhand comment about how life can get crazy quickly. I had already decided that we were not compatible based on the state of his house alone and my standards of cleanliness as a person. 

Imagine my horror when, to explain away the mess, he blamed it *all* on his ex-wife. He claimed that when she left, she carelessly sifted through for her belongings, which left the house in disorder. Except, she had left 8 months ago. *How did that explain the dirty dishes, the dirty laundry on the floor, and the unwashed sheets?* This was merely a snapshot of what his life looked like without a woman in it, and an affirmation of the ways in which he had manipulated me leading up to this moment of clarity.

As earlier mentioned, he claimed that his wife was *keeping* his son away from him. I later found out that it was because he kept promising her that he would clean his place and never did, which made it an unsafe environment for a one-year old. And how could a man who lived like this be trusted to care for a child? 

This whole situation was a stark wake-up call: men are so used to women picking up the slack for them that they'll victimize themselves at the expense of another woman's character — even the mother of their own child. It is a dangerous example of how their entitlement to a female-presence in their life  clouds their ability to self-reflect. 

So naturally is their inclination to blame women, that instead of getting his domicile in order to create the necessary conditions to nurture his infant son, he had spent months slandering the mother of his child to secure a new relationship without ever reflecting on what went wrong. What a nightmare!

Although this might be a more extreme example of manipulation, I can only imagine that a man like this won't change, but rather get better and better at twisting the narratives until some poor woman caves and believes him, setting herself up for a life of unpaid labor and the threat of being maligned just like her predecessor when she finally gets fed up. These kinds of men exist in every corner, and I can't help but imagine that this is the reality behind many ""dead bedroom"" situations. 

A woman can endure the difficulties of childbirth, be drained of their life force by having to parent emotionally stunted men, and it is still not enough — they are paid back in-kind by having their characters maligned to other women.

What is ever enough?

It's terrifying. ",TwoXChromosomes,3887,1711414372.0,393,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bnumvm/dating_a_recently_divorced_man_was_a_harrowing/
When rejecting a man can be dangerous,"When I was 20 I worked at a gas station in an area that had frequent armed robberies. It was meant to be a temporary gig until I found something better. I'm a petite woman &amp; my job had me closing the store by myself on Sunday nights. On those nights we closed at like 9pm or 10pm, so not super late but still after dark. 

I enjoyed the job but I always meant for it to be temporary because I knew the likeliness of me getting robbed was high. 

One Sunday night, while I was working alone, I was robbed at gunpoint by two males. I followed procedure, complied with their demands for the money in the two registers, locked the doors after they left, called 911, etc. Thankfully they didn't shoot &amp; it never became physical. The guys had their sweatshirt hoods up &amp; the ties pulled around their face so I really couldn't see who they were. 

2 weeks later I quit my job &amp; moved back to my home state. I actually had already planned on quitting &amp; moving when I did, I just hadn't told my boss yet so I used the robbery as my excuse for leaving. 

A year later, a police officer shows up at my door. The PD in the state I was robbed in called my local PD trying to find me. They had found the two guys who robbed me &amp; wanted me to go back to that state to testify against the one who wasn't cooperating. 

So they tell me who the guys are that robbed me. 

It was one guy who I guess came in often buying alcohol, he had came in but didn't have his ID with him, &amp; I guess I wouldn't sell to him saying I didn't recognize him. He was pissed &amp; that's why he wanted to rob me. 

The other guy -- was my coworker's son. This dude was younger than me &amp; he would ride his bicycle to my work often just to talk to me. I could tell he had a thing for me but I wasn't into him at all. Still, as women we're taught to be polite, so I was polite every time he came in to bother me. He was never rude or anything like that. But he told the police that he was upset that I wasn't into him &amp; that's why he wanted to rob me. 

I seriously can't even make this shit up. The dude thought it was a great idea to rob me at gunpoint at work because I didn't flirt back with him &amp; clearly didn't want to date him. 

So when guys tell us to stop being so dramatic when we get upset &amp; creeped out by men who constantly harass us, pursue us, &amp; just won't take no for an answer --This is why we get upset. This is why we get worried when men show these behaviors. This is why women everywhere are finally standing up against this type of behavior. 

We're not ""making a big deal out of nothing."" 
Because we can't tell the difference between the man who will eventually back off &amp; the man who will eventually get violent.",TwoXChromosomes,14171,1611808788.0,763,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/l6o5f5/when_rejecting_a_man_can_be_dangerous/
Last night highlighted the difference between flirting and creepy,"Posting this from a throwaway account:

I’m a young woman in my 20s, and I’m also an independent concert promoter (I don’t want to give too many details.) I hosted a show last night - a small one - and two different interactions during the night really highlighted the difference between appropriate and inappropriate behavior towards women, something that a lot of men have asked me questions about before and during the #metoo era.

First, I obviously knew the artists that I booked last night and most of the venue staff, but I didn’t know most of the attendees (which is actually pretty cool for a promoter!) My boyfriend didn’t come, simply because he was tired from work, so I came to and left the venue alone.

At the end of the show, a guy I didn’t know briefly stopped me and said “I just wanted to tell you that you’re really pretty.” I thanked him for the compliment and that was the end of that (I was in a hurry to settle up with the bands.) Why wasn’t this a problem? Because it wasn’t harassment, it wasn’t a sexual comment, he didn’t touch me or follow me around the venue, and he had no way of knowing I had a boyfriend (which I would have told him, had the conversation continued.) It was just a compliment!

A little bit later in the evening, after I’d settled up with the bands, we were all hanging out and chatting outside the venue when two guys joined us (they had arrived pretty late into the show.) Nobody knew them, but they seemed like nice guys, wanted to ask the bands questions about what it’s like to play shows and write music, wanted to ask me questions about what I do. Some of the comments turned flirty and I started to get uncomfortable with the way they were looking at me. I mentioned my boyfriend a couple of times (he’s also a musician and has performed with the headlining band on numerous occasions), but no matter how many times I made it clear I was in a relationship, they kept making comments along the lines of “you don’t have a boyfriend, right?”

At this point, all but the headlining band had left, and the two guys had sat down at the table with us - and they were REALLY, uncomfortably close to me, in a way that made it very difficult for me to get to the exit. I think one of the guys from the band realized what was going on, because he started talking about my boyfriend and what a great guy/performer he was (which clearly made the two guys feel awkward, since they couldn’t spend half of the conversation denying his existence). I wanted to leave at this point, but I was concerned about the possibility of them following me to my car (which has happened in situations like this before), and it was blocked in anyway.

At this point, my boyfriend called to make sure I was okay and ask if I was on my way home, and I told him I was trying to leave soon (obviously I didn’t tell him about the two guys, who were still right next to me). Immediately after I got off the phone, the band decided they were going to leave and started ushering the guys towards their merch table; this created enough of a distraction for me to bolt out of there before the guys noticed. I ended up having to hop a curb to get my car out of there.

Why did I react so differently to those guys than I did to the guy who called me pretty? Because these guys were repeatedly making comments that were clearly unwelcome, ignoring the fact that I was in a relationship, and stayed extremely close to me (the show was well over and it wasn’t crowded at that point - no reason to be that damn close.) The first guy made a nice comment and didn’t know I was unavailable. The other two guys became a potential threat when they repeatedly pressed the matter, ignored what I had to say, and stayed way closer to me than what’s socially acceptable. 

Tl;dr: Guys, if you’re going to make the first move, make one respectful “move” instead of an unreciprocated series (and give her some space, for fuck’s sake.)

EDIT: I’d like to thank the guys who sent me private messages telling me to go fuck myself for their interest in a post about how men and women can positively and respectfully interact. Calling me a man-hating millennial bitch shows that you definitely know more about respecting the opposite sex than I do, and your nuanced approach to this complicated subject is appreciated.

Also, to answer many people asking why I didn’t call them out on their behavior right then and there: partly because I just don’t like confrontation if I can help it, and partly because starting a big stink at your own event can be viewed as unprofessional, even if it’s arguably justified.",TwoXChromosomes,16132,1539270168.0,1756,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9naqeh/last_night_highlighted_the_difference_between/
It is so EXHAUSTING being a woman,"I'm sorry but I need to vent and I love that this is a safe space to do so.

This morning I woke up with a UTI. I visited my long distance boyfriend this weekend, and while I always pee after sex, I assume it is a result of being intimate and I just have bad luck. The pain became worse and worse as the day went on, a lot of crying and a lot of switching between screaming while on the toilet and trying to waddle around to keep moving since that lessens the pain.

I scheduled a virtual doctor's appointment because I didn't think I could drive myself to the clinic today and there was a pharmacy within walking distance. Great! It took about four minutes and I was able to walk to the store to get the prescription (and a pint of ice cream) and walk home.

Unfortunately, on the walk home, a man in a car slowed down next to me and called out to me: ""Hey. Hey you. Hey I'm talking to you. Why won't you look at me? Hey turn this way"". I ignored him and continued walking and once I was one house away from mine, I realized he. had. followed. me. the. entire. way. home. My house is the last on the street and I froze, realizing he now knew where I lived. My three roommates are away this entire week and so it is just me alone. I stopped in front of my neighbor's house trying to decided what to do, when my neighbor said a quick hello and only then did the man turn around and drive away.

I've locked everything and gone upstairs but wow. I'm so tired today. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of having to deal with biological shit like UTIs after having enjoyable sex. I'm tired of our bodies being in pain like this. I'm tried of men thinking it is OK to call out to me on the street. I'm tired of men thinking it is OK to follow me home. I'm tired of knowing there's a real fear that comes from men following me like this. I'm tired of feeling scared.

Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.

EDIT: I just wanted to express how grateful I am to everyone for their support and kind messages. My heart also goes out to everyone who commented saying they also have experienced UTI or bodily pain and/or feeling unsafe while outside alone. I am so sorry these things are so common, but I am here with you in solidarity.

"I just need to be sad right now. My kid is permanently, unequivocally, forever battling a medical condition. And it sucks.","And I don't know where else to share this. It's 11pm on Halloween night. My friends, family, and husband are all fast asleep. I'm laying beside my 7 year old daughter, cradling her as she survives through the chaos that is Type 1 Diabetes. She's snoring, but in between bouts of snores, she whimpers. About an hour ago, she cried out ""Why is this me?!"" then was right back to sleep.



I cry. For the first time since her diagnosis, I really really cry. You know the kind. Snot dripping down your face, big awkward gulps of air. Wailing.



Thank goodness she's a heavy sleeper.



She was just diagnosed in August. It's been 3 months. Only 3 months? And today, she ate a few extras candies (literally like 3 candies at school). Her blood sugar levels were high. Then we went trick or treating, and they got low. So we treated them with 15g of simple sugars - candy. We sat on the walking trail by our house while she laid down in her Joan of Arc costume. We waited. She came back up. My husband was ancy because our son was getting tired.  So we pushed through. We got to our friend's and she could barely stand. I gave her a piggy back ride and she said, ""You're the best mom ever. Like really, ever."" 



She struggled the whole way home. I tried to give her a piggy back ride again, but I was tired. She ninja rolled under our neighbour's fence to take the shortcut home. I met her there. 



And all night, she's had a horrific headache. Her stomach hurts. And she's weepy. Everything is the worst. My amazing, strong, fucking brilliant little mini-me is now wailing in pain because her stupid fucking pancreas has decided to stop making insulin. Fuck you, pancreas. 



She asks me to read to her. I do. Normally, it's one book, then 10 minutes of cuddles. Today, it's as many books as she wants. She asks me to keep reading as she falls asleep. I read Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, while admiring my own little rebel girl.



One who will now die if she doesn't have insulin. 



Everything changes so quickly. For the first time since her diagnosis, I long for the days when our biggest hurdle was her having temper tantrums and wetting the bed. 



Now she has a team of people who need to be her pancreas. 



She snores. She wails. She cries. Then, for the first time since her diagnosis, she throws up. 



Now, if you know anything about people with t1d, it's that they need carbs, along with insulin, to keep their numbers stable.



She just threw up all of her carbs. The carbs that keep her from having seizures, or falling into a coma.



Her numbers go lower.



I go to the kitchen to grab water, and by the time I'm back, she's fallen back asleep.



With as much love as forcefully possible, I manage to get her to eat a single bite of a banana. I have to wake her up to do so.



She throws up 20 minutes later. 
I give her a spoonful of honey. She manages to take it. For now. 



I call the ""pediatric endocrinologist"", because my child now has a fucking specialist doctor? And he says to keep the needles and syringes handy in case her numbers go low again. I start bawling as I try to give him my email address so he can send me explicit instructions on now to stick a needle into my kid. And now, I'm awake, checking her every hour. 



I have work in the morning. 



This is my life now. 



This is her life now.



I try to practice gratitude, but in this moment, it just sucks ass. She's one of the healthiest kids I've ever met. She eats cherry tomatoes as a snack. She loves avocados. She tries new things. She self reflects. She sleeps well. She is adaptable. She drinks water. We don't even keep juice in the house (at least, not until sugar became her medication, because what the fuck right?) She stands up for her friends at school. She does math for fun. She sings and imagines. She's honest. We're as close as a mom and daughter can be (in a healthy way).



So, I'm pretty sure that we're living in the twilight zone. Everything feels upside down.



I'm thankful that she has such a strong support network. But at this moment, I feel cripplingly alone. I feel like I need to remember this night, our first really hard night. Maybe it'll knock me out of my positivity and gratitude that seems to weird people out. Maybe it'll make me more cynical or resentful. 



But then I look at her, and my heart bursts with love. At least we're in this together, her and me. Because if anyone could fucking own this shit, it's her.



I'm pretty sure that she's my hero. 


I don't even really know what the point of sharing this is. To feel a little less alone, maybe.


I gotta go now. I gotta check to see if her blood sugars are stable. 



Thanks for listening.


Edit: Holy shit. I posted this around midnight my time, and was thankful if I had gotten a few words of encouragement and support. I did NOT expect to wake up this morning to so much solidarity. Thank you all, so so much. My daughter is an incredible person, and we keep our adaptability and enthusiasm as high as possible on most days. This is the darkest day I've ever had with it so far, I think because I had to have the specialized ""In Case of Emergency"" Glucagon needle ready. My usual response to people is, ""I'm just thankful that we live in the time and place that we're in"", and that if anyone is strong enough for this, it's my daughter. She's been relatively on target for the first 2.5 months, but the past couple of weeks have been wildly random, and it's been hard to understand why. We have it comparatively easy because she's incredibly healthy otherwise. She still has Halloween candy from last year! As a mother, I consciously focused on removing the shame and emotional attachment that my family history has to food (and body image, and self-care), and for the most part, my daughter has a great outlook on herself, her relationship with her body, and with how she takes care of it. It's made dealing with the diagnosis so much more manageable. She has an incredible support network, a great school, I have a great job, and we are all rallying around her. We are really fortunate. Thank you for letting me share my darkness with you all so that it didn't come out of me in her presence.

We try to see her t1d as ""you're not sick, it's just an extra thing you need to do to take care of yourself, like how we take showers and eat nutritious food and get good sleep. You can still do all the things, we just need to do these extra steps."" But last night was a ""yep, my kid is definitely sick beyond normal sick"" kind of night, and it slapped me in the face.


Many of you have asked about CGMs and Pumps - our work benefits are finicky, and our doctors advised not to consider these tools for at least six months ""so we know how to handle things without them"". FWIW, we're in Canada. It's been three months, and I feel like a CGM would allow us to actually establish consistent patterns and make informed choices, so we decided to go ahead and apply for the insurance coverage. We're now just in the limbo of waiting for approval and then getting set up (with a Dexcom G6). It takes time, but we're pushing towards it. As for pumps, we hadn't even really considered one because she had been on target so frequently. But if I can prevent another night like this (while still giving her the space to just BE A KID), then I'm all for it. I will be looking into it today.

Again, thank you all for everything. The private messages, the awards (what do I do with these? Thank you for making my daughter's story more visible!), the comments, the practical advice; even the insensitive comments are appreciated - it comes with the territory of putting yourself out there, and it's worth it. Thank you all for sharing your stories of living with t1d, or being a support of someone with t1d. It means so much to me. Our family stands on the shoulders of giants who have found solutions to the problems so that we can adapt easier. I will do my best to get back to everyone that I can, but even if I don't, know that I read every single message and have been crying like a baby.

Creepy dude won’t leave you alone? Barking helps,"So this happened on the weekend and I feel like sharing to this wonderful sub 

Went out for drinks with a few friends on the weekend. Got a little more dressed up than usual for once because F it, why not? I hardly ever do and it was fun to get ready with the girls. 

The night is over and I decide to walk home as where we ended up is very close to my home. I live in a big city, but the area wasn’t bad, it was busy, I wasn’t worried. 

I start walking and maybe 5 minutes in, as I’m crossing the street, some guy intercepts me as soon as I hit the sidewalk and wraps his arms around my waist, yanking me into him. I didn’t even see him coming. I yelled out WTF and pushed him back. This asshole is clearly drunk, grabs my arms and yanks me back in. Again, I push back and start backing up, telling him to not touch me again. He said something along the lines of “cmon, you can’t be out here lookin this fine and expect me to not say hi!” (Since when is grabbing strangers saying hi btw). 

He starts walking after me and I see him reaching for me again, so I just faced him and started barking, as loudly and aggressively as I can. Literally like a dog would. I don’t even know why I chose to, I just wanted to do something outrageous to make him back off and think I’m crazy or something.

It worked. The look on his face was priceless. He just turned around and walked away, it was awesome.

I unmatched with a guy from a dating app because alarm bells were ringing in my head and now I feel terrible,"I don’t know if it’s my anxiety or what. But he kept pushing to meet in person, alone. Even after I told him I wasn’t ready for that yet. It was like he was ignoring all the boundaries I tried to put up. He wanted me to hang out with just him after I was done with work today. Knowing I don’t drive and he’s have to pick me up. The pushiness made me sick to my stomach. So I unmatched and blocked him without saying anything. And I just feel awful about it. Even though my intuition told me to. I worried I hurt his feelings.

Edit: just wanted to say thank you to everyone reassuring me. I’m trying to respond as best I can but I’m working. I can’t thank you all enough for helping me. I’m glad I wasn’t the only one who saw the red flags.

Edit: thank you all for the awards. I agree with you all that it was super sketchy. At best I avoided being killed or sexually assaulted. At worst I ghosted someone who might’ve been a decent guy who was just eager to meet. Either way I’m glad I trusted my instincts.

Final edit: thank you all for your insight! I decided that I’m gonna take a break from the online dating world until I’m at a place where putting up boundaries doesn’t scare me. I’m going to be getting into therapy in October. And I bought the book everyone has been mentioning so I’m looking forward to reading it. Thank you all so much for your comfort.

Actual final edit: I followed the advice of some kind redditors and reported him. At the very least he’s on their radar and it starts a record if he does it to anyone else. It’s not much. And maybe a little overkill. But if it helps keep someone else safe so be it.

Update: the app got back to me about my report. He is *not* getting banned. However it looks like they’re keeping the report I made on record in case he does it to anyone else so they can ban him if it comes to that. I didn’t expect him to get banned. Let alone to get a response.",TwoXChromosomes,6480,1629908063.0,1032,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/pbehsp/i_unmatched_with_a_guy_from_a_dating_app_because/
We should not have to decide between standing up for ourselves or maintaining our own safety.,"So the other day I was around a trolley stop,  roller skating and minding my own business. I saw a random dude pointing at me which weirded me out, but I just kept my headphones in and ignored it.

After about half an hour I sit down to take a break, and the same guy points at me again and starts coming up to me. He's not wearing a mask and he's smoking, so I immediately asked him to step back. He starts getting defensive and said I was just tryna compliment you I wasn't even trying to get at you. I told him that I was uncomfortable when he was pointing at me and that I'm concerned about the pandemic we're in so I needed him to step back and put on his mask.

Just like that a flip switched; he starts yelling at me and calling me a bitch. Yelling that he wasn't even tryna get at me, that he was just tryna compliment me. And I said I already told you that I'm uncomfortable, so if you wanna compliment me do it in another way that doesn't make me uncomfortable.
He's like I wouldn't make a woman uncomfortable, I have a daughter. You just can't take a compliment bitch. And I said do you talk to your daughter like that? Then he starts getting HEATED.

At this point I got my hand on my pepper spray I'm ready to pull it. He starts walking up to me and is like don't f*ckin talk about my daughter you dumb bitch. You can't even take a compliment. I yelled right back and said I'm not obligated to take your compliment. Bye have a good day sir.

He starts calling me all sorts of names and yells all sorts of insults. I told him sir I don't care how you feel, I was minding my business and you came up to me. So you can leave now, goodbye. 
He was clearly hurt that I didn't take his compliment. Even as he walked away he was yelling at me and I was like why are you still talking to me??? BYE

When I came home I told my boyfriend what happened, and one of his first reactions was that I could've just ignored him and it probably would have been safer for me. I get where he was coming from but it kind of pissed me off; why should I have to sit there and take that bullshit in the name of safety? That creep was rude, entitled, and invaded my boundaries. I have every right to call him out and confront him. It is just so shitty that I should have to decide between catering to a man's ego for my own safety, or standing up for myself and putting myself in potential danger.


**Edit:** Wow, thanks for all the support y’all. This is my first post here and I didn’t expect to receive such a flood of responses. I'm filled with love and gratitude for everyone who's spoken up with support or shared their experiences. 

For some context; the incident happened in a well-lit area by a busy street, lots of people walking by. I'm a college student and the area I was in is a popular place for skaters to practice. I gauged my environment and made a decision on how I wanted to react, and I stand by it. You're welcome to disagree, but I made MY best judgement and I hope everyone reading takes some time to read through the replies to get a sense of how common my experience is for other women.

Regarding my boyfriend — I was pretty frustrated when I wrote this post, but I know what he said was in good intention. I think his reaction is common for a lot of people, because they instantly want to find a way to make sure you can avoid a situation like that in the future. Men in particular are conditioned to think that way because that’s the narrative they’ve always heard. We had a conversation about it and I explained why it was more important to me to feel validated in my feelings instead of being told what I could’ve done differently, which makes it feel like it was my fault I was harassed. He’s an amazing boyfriend and is open to learning; he understands that he has some ways to go so please stop bashing him lol. 

Lastly, remember that this is a subreddit to learn about different perspectives from self identified WOMEN so if you’re not here to listen or learn, you’re wasting your time. I’m grateful I can share this space with other powerful women and men who are open to learning so if you’re offended by anything I said, it takes less than 10 seconds to hit that “leave” button ❤️

To the guy who helped my niece tonight!,"My darling niece (18) went out tonight for a few drinks with her friends, it was her first night out without any aunties/sisters with her, she finally felt confident enough to do it.

After a few drinks and some laughs they went different ways home, 2 caught a taxi, my niece and her friends went to get the bus. Her friends bus left 10 minutes before hers usually arrived so she was happy enough to say goodbye and wait by herself, it wasn't even 10. She did her usual text to her mum and myself saying she was at the bus stop would text when on the bus.

While waiting 3 boys saw her and proceeded to chat her up. One of which moved her bag to the other side of him and blocked her from getting it. She had one on her right, one on her left and one blocking her in the front. They were trying to get her to go somewhere with them. Told her they knew a great place to get drinks, they would by them for her all night, even had a place for her to stay if she missed her bus. She told them no and asked nicely if they would leave her alone, they werent listening!

After a few minutes this lad comes up to them, takes her bag off the seat, grabs her hand and tells the boys thanks for looking after his lady and pulled her away from them.
Whole walking her down the street he tells her to walk normal, his names jake and he was going to get her home.
He asked what her name was, asked her if she could videocall someone on her phone for him.

She calls me, I answer and this sweet guy tells me his name, his age and why he was with her. He walks to his car opens the door for her then walks around his car showing my his number plate and any marks he has on his car. He also tells me to screen shot his face and his number plate.

He took her home, told her mum she was being harassed and he had to do something to help her. Anything could have happened to her but he made a decision to not let the happen. 

Thank you for showing her what a real man does, thank you for making her feel safe, thank you for making me see that some men are still raised right and thank you for asking her out on a date I'm hopeful it turns out to be as amazing as you seem to be!!

EDIT: For the people I offended by using 'real man', compared to the 3 boys who harassed her, made her uncomfortable, wouldn't leave her alone, suggested things to her, invaded her personal space, he is a real man. He made sure she was safe, he had a chance to take her out of a potentially dangerous situation and he took it. Real men help woman when they need to be helped, they don't use their size to intimidate woman, to try and pressure them. You are probably going to have a problem with this last statement but my niece is safe thats all that matters.",TwoXChromosomes,32404,1491350047.0,1352,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/63i0n9/to_the_guy_who_helped_my_niece_tonight/
UPDATE: I’ve realized I have lost all respect for willful ignorance and it may damage my marriage.,"Thank you to all who commented.

UPDATE: We had a serious discuss. I went into more details about my concerns and fears and it was… intense. I was much better at presenting the case. I gave him several hypotheticals that involved a particularly gruesome set of circumstances involving his ballsac ( 😬). I won’t bore you with the nitty gritty but the gist was to shift his perspective. I told him to seriously consider carrying a tiny fetus in his ball sac and the fact that the risk were things like Exploding Balls, Sepsis, etc and the myriad of ways he could end up dead, permanently physically injured and disfigured, or unable to produce a fetus in the future if he didn’t have the option of removing the fetus from his ballsac. I asked him if he would even want to take the risk and he agreed that he’d be very likely to remove it unless he was ready for those risks. I asked him why in the world would I be justified in telling him he HAS to carry it no matter what and it *might* only be removed after it starts to explode out of his ballsac or his organs start shutting down… etc.

 Once he seemed to start grasping the enormity of what abortion encompasses and seeing why it’s very important to not let unknown people control what options you have with no medical reason… I told him I lost a bit of respect for willful ignorance (and that I can tell he avoided thinking about it bc he knows in some way that it says something about his character) and I RESENTED having to even give him a hypothetical in the first place and that if he cares for me and our daughter that he should automatically actively be using his empathy skills every day. I explained how I have demonstrated the capacity to care about and evaluate gender issues he’s brought to my attention in the past. That was a… difficult part of the conversation. I also told him that I do not trust him to always make good decisions for us and that I feel alone in my shouldering of those responsibilities.

He listened and let me talk a lot. He asked if I was going to leave him and he was clearly nervous and bracing for the worst. I told him I’m not taking drastic steps like that but I certainly will when it comes to keeping our daughter healthy and safe. I also started to say something about how I know I would lie to him in a heart beat in a situation where our daughter needed an abortion or medical care and he interrupted me to say “You wouldn’t have to lie because I’ll be driving the car or buying the plane tickets and we will all go anywhe we need to”. Y’all, I burst into tears.

We ended the conversation and he said I laid a lot on him and he needed a break but says he has things to think about. I didn’t push anymore politics but I think I feel like my trust has been slightly restored. I’m not getting my hopes up but I think he realizes that he’s wading in dark and dangerous waters when it comes to our futures. 

ORIGINAL POST:

I (33F) and my husband (37M) were having a discussion about politics and we got onto the topic of our daughter (7F) which led to me expressing my fears about her rights and bodily autonomy. 

*For context, my husband votes Republican and I have always considered myself independent but recently have been shifting very far away from my younger “carefree” attitude toward politics. I love him very much and I know for a fact that he loves me but I have started finding his opinions naive and lacking depth. He is a very good man though and has in the past changed his mind on several things when confronted with them. FURTHER context: my cousin lives in a strict anti-abortion state and almost died a few years ago when the doctors waited until she was actively dying of sepsis before they decided it was okay to remove the dead baby from her body even though it had been dead for weeks beforehand (so needless to say I had a wake-up call and sharpened up my principles until they are very shiny and pointy)*

Last night when we were talking about abortion rights being healthcare, I lost my composure out of sheer terror about the possibility of a similar disaster with my cousin happening to our daughter and how I struggle to understand how he doesn’t see the problem with his party and that in fact I think he is being willfully ignorant to the danger I and my daughter face in favor of his idea about making economics work for our family. I also said that if our daughter dies due to something preventable, like the ability to get a timely and much needed abortion or gets shot to death in school that I would let my own mother rot in a nursing home (she votes R too) and I’d never be able to look him in the face again which would basically be me disappearing and divorcing him.

I was crying and upset and explaining how scared I am and he asked me in a very hurt manner if I’d actually abandon him like that and I am truthful to a fault and said that I would, perhaps out of a sense of illogical grief and betrayal, because I’d know my concerns were not taken seriously and that they had abandoned common sense and did nothing to attempt preventing a very real consequence of voting away mine and my daughter’s right to healthcare. I equated it to a slow motion car wreck with our daughter in mortal danger and him just watching it happen bc it doesn’t involve his own body.

I know he needs to hear it. But I think I was too raw and open about it to steer the conversation in a healthy way and I have a very blunt manner. I apologized this morning for saying that I’d leave him, even though I know I would, and he tentatively accepted it. And I said we’d talk about things later when I can articulate things in a healthier way. But I’m at a loss as to how to make it known how deadly serious this is to me and not make him feel like I’d abandon our marriage over just any sensitive topic.

I do not need people telling me to leave him. I don’t think I know how to make it anymore digestible and be clear without going nuclear over something that has not happened as our daughter is too young to suffer that yet. The rub is that I am the person who is changing the dynamic of our relationship. And I am beginning to understand how politics breaks up families.",TwoXChromosomes,2898,1720798564.0,360,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1e1knlo/update_ive_realized_i_have_lost_all_respect_for/
To the girl that I followed today for almost four blocks to her car,"We were walking in oposite directions near the new studient accomodations, you briefly looked at me and kept walking and a couple of seconds later I turned around and started following you, I notice the moment you realised that I was following you by how your pace changed, your shoulders squared and you grabbed your phone. That didn't stopped me, you just kept walking and I maintained the distance (some 50 feet behind you) pretending to talk on my phone, I thought a couple of times on closing the distance and introduce myself, talk to you, but I didn't, so you kept walking, throuwing glances to check where I was. I could also tell you that once you turned around the corner to the dead end street next to the motorway (the only one near the city centre were parking is not measured) were your car (and mine) was parked that if you had being wearing tennis shoes you would probably have started to run, but wisely you kept you pace in your high heel boots. I stopped by my car, yours was further down the street, and used my phone again, and I saw you taking a picture or video of my when you passed by my side in your car.

What you probably never noticed was the other two guys, the ones in the other sidewalk, the ones that pointed at you and started to follow you before we crossed the first time, you didn't notice how they looked at you or the fact that they seemed to be on drugs, or a bit drunk, or maybe both. You also didn't notice when you passed me in your car that they were in the corner of the dead end street, looking at you in your car passing by and then at me. You also missed the next ten minutes while I waited in my car for the police to arrive (that I called while you were getting into your car), the 15 minutes of questions that followed and me showing them the picture of the two guys that I took while I was following you.

I really sorry that I scared you, but to be completely honest, I was really scared myself, I'm no hero by any means and my instinct was telling me to get the f\*\*\* out of there, but you could have been my wife (she parks in the same street) or my daughter and I wouldn't fogived myself I something happened and I did nothing to stopped it.

(Belfast, 14 Nov 18, 4pm)

&amp;#x200B;

Edited to clarify a couple of things:

1 I shared this because the situation scared me, and if a similar situation happened somewhere else I wish that the situation is not ignored or shrugged off. Do I have any advice? Dunno, probably just this: if you think that you are being followed or that something is wrong, don’t wait to see what happen, call the police, call a friend, a family member, knock on a door or get into a shop, worst case scenario you’ll look a bit paranoid.

2 She was carrying some sort of briefcase alongside her purse and was well dressed, I think that the briefcase was what called those guys attention .

3 They seemed to be waiting for an opportunity, that was the main reason why I didn’t approached, I was afraid that I would sort of trigger them and offer a second target (still, probably wrong on my side, but in the moment that's what I thought).

4 I called the police because if those guys were trying to assault her, more than likely it wasn’t the first time and / or they would go for another victim, if it was a mistake worst case scenario they spent 10 mins talking to the police (no idea if they caught them).

5 I parked my car in the dead end street and was walking towards the city centre, she was coming from the city centre, obviously I didn’t know where she was heading, if instead of turning to the dead end street she had continued walking I would had probably approach her, or she would had reach another street that has more traffic and there are more people walking around.

For the ones wanting to know where this happened:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Final EDIT:

1 For some reason I can't see any new replies from the last 8 or 9 hours, I have seen some of them in the notification's bar in my phone but not all the text is showed and I can't reply from there (and I wanted to reply to some of them) and this is the reason for a final edit.

2 To the people that think this is BS: I whish it was, you don't have to believe me and in fact I don mind, just do yourself a favor and be safe out there (regardless of your gender)

3 I think that someone asked for the police report: REALLY??? Do you expect from me to upload a document with my personal information just so you can ""believe me""?

4 To clarify what happened: I saw the two guys gesturing only a couple of seconds before I crossed the girl and I kept walking a bit trying to decide what to do (turn around?, keep walking?, shout at her?, shout at them?) I deceided to follow her just in case, I didn't know what the guys intentions were (if any) or even if they knew her, but the constant glances at her and finaly the fact that they stayed in the corner (entrance) to the dead end street and the way they looked at her when she passed by in her car was what made me call the police (also, don't forget that I was in that same f\*\*\*\* street and to go back to the city centre I would have had to walk by them).

4.1 Adendum: Northern Ireland is part of te UK, not ROI (Republic Of Ireland) and here we call the police ""the police""

5 Was my decision the best one? most likely not, but it's what I did and no one was hurt (beyond being scared, that is). Now that it passed and reviewing the situation (alongside with some of the comments here) if anything similar happens again I would try to approach the person and explain the situation, or even maybe call the cops straight away.

To the man on the other side of the street...,"Throwaway because people know my actual reddit account~

Last night I was at the club, and all my friends left early to go home and rest. When I was walking out to my car, I passed a couple men who made some disgusting comments on my body. This wasn't unusual, but this time some of them turned around and started following me. They kept calling me names, and eventually one of them slapped my ass. I ignored this, and kept walking to my car. Eventually one of them grabbed my arm and said something like, ""Hey, wanna come with us?"" I got scared and started running to my car, and that's when the man on the other side of the street saw me. He ran up and said, ""Hey babe"". I was a little scared and confused so I didn't respond, but he quickly followed up by asking the group of guys what they were doing, and to ""fuck off."" He escorted me to my car, made sure I was safe, then left and I never saw him again.

"A man tried to scare me and I did something unsafe, but it was so satisfying.","I live in a big city with crowded sidewalks and walkways. Typically people stay to their right and form two lanes walking in each directions.

On 3-4 separate occasions, typically at night or when the streets are less crowded, a man will go out of his way to walk in the opposite lane and bump into me. They typically stare you down, willing you to move aside for them, and walk straight through you.

I grew up with a dad who loved power plays like that. I always hold my ground, walk on the right side of the sidewalk as I normally would, and brace myself as well as I can when he drives his shoulder into mine ... but I'm 5'5"" and not any physical force to be reckoned with. 

Yesterday I was walking home from work, carrying a huge ceramic plant pot that my coworker gifted me. I'm walking alone on the sidewalk, and a man is walking towards me.

He is staring at me and I watch him switch over to the other side of the sidewalk, directly in my path. There are no stores or anything around. He was moving over to scare me into stepping aside for him. 

As he approaches, he continues staring me down. I know its possible he was going to mug or assault me when he made contact, and I know what I did next was unsafe, but I could see this coming and it made me *angry.* 

He crashes into me, trying to walk through me, and I smashed the lip of that giant ceramic pot right into his breastbone with as much force as I could manage.

I heard the wind knock out of him. Now this man could feel what its like to be on *my* end of this sort of intimidation tactic.

He screamed obscenities and I took that moment to get my mace out, in case he attacked as I walked off.

I know it was unsafe, but I'm glad at least one man learned his lesson about pushing women around.",TwoXChromosomes,6033,1691074003.0,324,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/15h69bi/a_man_tried_to_scare_me_and_i_did_something/
Why is it so hard to believe women suffer from pain?,"I just got back from a wasted hour of my life with my partner, trying to explain to a physical medicine doctor that her searing, burning, tingling and painful sensations through the right side of her body is not a ""psychosocial event"". It is very real. I have watched her suffering for over a month with doctor after doctor shoving it off on a different specialist every time we're in. We're the problem patients that keep going to different specialists and I cannot for the life of me understand why no one will believe us.

It's real. I see it every day. I see her loss of neuromuscular function. I see that a month ago we were hiking and mountain biking and camping and she's in so much pain now that she can't even walk a mile. And the best this doctor can do is acquiesce to a single xray, that we begged for, because even with the recommendation of a physical therapist who clearly sees the deficiencies in mobility, this is a ""psychosocial event"". This is all in her head. It's insulting, and infuriating and exhausting. I cannot for the life of me understand how neuropathy does not equate at the very least to imaging to rule out a mechanical injury. But you're a woman and an athlete who spends time analyzing the movement patterns of other athletes. So you made it up because your saw it in other people, and it's in your head, and nothing is actually wrong with you, despite previous MRIs showing abnormality of the spine before that doctor sent us off to this one. What the ever living fuck is wrong with the healthcare system, and how the fuck do we fix this, because this is absolutely untenable.

And doctors have the audacity to wonder why there are so many anti vaxxers, so many alternative medicine practitioners, so many people denying the very real benefits of medical science. Because MDs did this to themselves. They trivialize and downplay and waffle about the ""nocebo effect"" and dehumanize the individual to the point that if someone, anyone is willing to actually LISTEN, it doesn't matter if that person is an MD or a functional medicine practitioner. If you won't hear about people's very real problems, don't be shocked when they turn away and seek out alternative medicine that will. I don't for a second believe in alternative medicine but I am starting to understand why so many others do, and I can't blame them for a second.

EDIT: holy shit y'all. Honestly I just posted last night because I was tired, and scared, and had nowhere else to turn except the internet to vent out just a fraction of this never ending anxiety and pain and you all turned up for real. I don't even have the words for how your support and stories have made us not feel so alone in the world right now and I am so sorry that this resonates so deeply with so many of you.

A couple things. 1) we've got a neuro who is willing to work with us and whom I have faith will refer us once his diagnostics are done and if they come back as something he does not specialize in, as he only works with a small portion of seizure disorders, and we don't really fall into that category at this time.

2) To the doctors coming out - I get it. I hold that this is one bad MD who did not ethically treat her patient to the best standard of care possible. A huge part of my frustration is that this likely an incredibly complex issue spanning multiple disciplines and involving multiple parts of her body failing to work properly. The way medicine is fragmented into micro specialities is making this almost impossible to work through, since no one is forming the big picture and only focusing on their area of expertise. Which is fair and also hella frustrating beyond belief. Healthcare didn't have to be like this. American healthcare in particular is its own form of dystopian hell and it's not the fault of individual practitioners in the system. 

Except for this doctor. Who said that small, petite women often have inhibited movement and some pain in the right arm because of their size. That's...that's a bad doctor, guys. What the fuck is that even. Congratulations on your dad owning a wing in a hospital somewhere, because honest to god that's the only way I can justify her graduating medical school. 

3) Just...thank you guys. We're both terrified that this will not ever be properly addressed and she's going to spend the rest of her life slowly losing the physicality that defined her since her days as a competitive cyclist. I appreciate the stories of hope and I identify with the stories of continued failures.

I just wanted to get a bagel,"So around 10AM this morning, I shuffled out of my apartment to go grab some breakfast a few blocks away. I got to my spot, got my food, and started to mindlessly meander back home when I heard a woman shout, ""no, leave me alone.""

I snapped out of my daze and saw a woman who was being accosted and followed way too closely by some man. When her and I made eye contact I could see the fear. I did what I always do in these situations - swiftly got right inbetween them and got right up in the dudes face.


Here's the thing. I'm a 6'2 trans woman (and busty, and I think kinda hot - visually, I stand out, is what I'm trying to say.)  I personally hate my height, but it is a double-edged sword. It no doubt works for me and against me in all sorts of ways. This was one of a handful of times I've had to be confrontational to defend another woman being harassed and being tall helps. Also, this guy was like 5' nothing, (but still taller than her). I could have DESTROYED him.

So I got up in this guys face, which looks hilarious cause he barely reaches my tits. I just loomed over him and was like, ""you're not talking to her anymore, now you're talking to me."" I wasnt trying to out myself or anything but but my voice did drop a little. He was definitely caught off guard by the very sudden and unexpected circumstance he was in. I then tried to Chris Hansen him a little.

""What's your name?""

""Jon.""

""Here's the problem, Jon. Its 10AM, and you REEK of alcohol and cigarettes. It's a bad look, Jon. Very bad.""

""You should be worried about her instead!""

""She's fine, but you're not. You need to turn around right now, Jon, and go. Now.""


He turned around and fucked off. While we were chatting the woman must have made her escape cause I couldn't find her anywhere. So I crossed the street and continued home. When I crossed there was a second guy, looked older than who I just dealt with. He was watching over the situation. You know, surveying. Keeping the peace. Being helpful in a tense situation. He gave me a thumbs up.

"My husband feels ""bombarded""... and I am so tired.","I just need to vent to people that might hear me for once.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband leaves for work at 7:30a and gets home at 6p. We have a 14 month old son who just started daycare. I work from home full time (and am the breadwinner), but my job is very demanding. I walk my son to daycare (.3 miles from home) each morning when my husband leaves for work, and I pick him up at 4p. His bedtime is 6p, and he has been so tired from daycare that I have not been able to push him much past that so that my husband can spend time with him at the end of the day. It sucks, but our son's sleep is the most important.

&amp;#x200B;

We are all currently sick (again, just started daycare and we all immediately got a cold). Yesterday, my husband called me at 5p while I was feeding my son dinner to tell me he was coming home early, it is a 30 minute drive. I said great, see you soon. Every night, I feed my son dinner at 5p and then we go upstairs for a bath and bedtime after dinner. My son was especially tired, and about 5:15p started getting really fussy. I took him outside to walk around with me a bit while we waited for his dad to get home. Dad gets home at 5:30p, we greet him, we are happy to see him. We go inside and I tell them I got them coats and such from Costco today, whatever. Our son is so exhausted, he bumps his nose on the floor and gets a nose bleed. I pick him up and ask my husband ""do you want to give him a bath while I start dinner?"" His response is ""I feel bombarded. I came home early because I do not feel good. I got light headed today at work."" I say ""Ok, then I will give him a bath."" Honestly, rather short but direct, our son needs a bath right now so I will just do it. He then starts following me saying he will give him a bath! But honestly, I do not want my husband caring for my son when he is in a bad mood. He has a very short temper and our son is 14 months, he tests A LOT of boundaries. I undress our son and start drawing the bath. My husband is standing in the doorway and says ""I just need to chug water and I will give him a bath."" I say OK. He then apparently went and chugged water, I did not see him leave because I had our son in the bath and I was trying to get his hair washed before his father took over. (Son doesn't like getting his hair washed and I didn't want it to result in my husband being short with him after such a long day) He then says ""do you want me to go start dinner....?"" I say ""Sure, that would be great. If you don't mind that would be really helpful."" He says ""I came home early to spend time with my son so I would like to give him a bath"" and I say ""Ok, great. I will go start dinner then."" I then start dinner, he bathes our son and calls for me to take him out and then he gets into the shower while I dry and dress our son and put him to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

When we go downstairs, he says ""I am sorry I didn't like the jacket you got me, I appreciate your thought --"" And I kind of cut him off and say ""I appreciate that, but I am not upset about that. I will return it, no big deal. I am upset you said you felt bombarded when I asked if you wanted to give our son a bath."" We then argue because he says this is him expressing his feelings and me ""blowing up"" at him about it. Would it kill him to just say ""Hey, I am sorry I just need a minute because I had a really long day"" or ""I would love to give him a bath, but I just need a few minutes to unwind"" or ANYTHING. Aside from telling me I am bombarding him? For asking him one question? And like what, did you think you were going to come home at 5:30 and just relax? Knowing it is bath and bedtime?

&amp;#x200B;

I am so exhausted. I even apologized for being passive aggressive, owned that I was upset and didn't think I could respond to him following me saying ""I will give him a bath"" without snapping. And all he wants to do is beat a dead horse. As though 100% of the issue that evening was me not responding after I get told I am bombarding him for asking literally ONE question (No, he doesn't know the definition of bombarding clearly). I get ""I am sorry for saying that but I don't think it's something I should have to apologize for because I was just saying how I felt."" Like, that isn't an apology? Might as well just say you don't care about my feelings. Which, fun fact, he doesn't. At all.

I am tired. I am so tired.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Wow. Thank you for all the responses. I didn't think this would get as much traction as it did. A lot of you took the time to formulate really thoughtful responses and I am taking those to heart. I have called a couple's counselor and am working on getting us into therapy.

To address a few things that were repeatedly asked/called out in the comments:

\- I do not believe my husband would ever hurt me or my son. That being said, he can be short. He does say things without thinking that I do think my son will someday very soon hear and potentially internalize. I have spoken to him about this and plan to try and address it more directly in therapy. (The example: I usually get up and grab my son when he wakes up but I was in the shower, so he did this one morning. My son was grumpy and my husband said ""I get it I shouldn't have even come to get you, I ruined your whole day!"" That just doesn't sit right with me. I am overprotective about his emotional negligence because his dad is literally an evil man who emotionally abused my husband his entire life.

\- My husband was a stay at home dad until 5 weeks ago. His work pays for daycare and our family's insurance. I pay for the mortgage, groceries and all bills. The reason I made the breadwinner comment and felt it was relevant is because I am currently sensitive to a situation. We got into a fight over the weekend because when he was a stay at home dad, I expected him to feed our son lunch and also clean up after it. This was when our son took (2) two hour naps a day. Before daycare started, I had our son home for five days over two weeks completely by myself, while also working. I fed him breakfast, lunch and dinner. He bitched at me about not having dinner cleaned up when he got home. (BTW - I also had dinner cooked for us.) I explained I feed him dinner at 5, then bathe and bedtime, he gets home at 6 and I haven't even been back downstairs yet. He said this is a double standard because when he was a stay at home dad I expected him to clean up after his lunch. I told him this is not a double standard because I am not a stay at home parent, I am a full time, working parent who is juggling taking care of our son while working a demanding WFH job. He will DIE on this hill that this is a double standard. He says that by me saying it is apples and oranges (which it is!) that I am insulting him as a stay at home parent and saying it is easy (???). That is not what I am saying but I am doing literally the same thing AND MORE (because I worked part time in the office, was always there for breakfast, only missed dinner (3) times in eight months) because I also have a full time job. He is refusing to acknowledge this. I explained he should be happy to clean up dinner because it can be a way he contributes towards our son's care for the day while I care for him while he is at work. He is SO ANGRY about this he packed a bag and threatened divorce. He has still not apologized. It has put me in a place that I feel very used, unappreciated, disregarded. I can't shake it.

\- I have spoken to a couple's counselor and we will go to find better ways to communicate because we are both terrible at it.

\- I do not need this man. I love him so much, but I will be fine without him caring for our son. If he is unwilling to accept any responsibility towards his anger (Which he has not. Every fight he tells me I am 100% of the problem and he is none. He tells me couple's therapy isn't fair because then he has to go even though he isn't part of the problem) then I will be divorcing him and hopefully find a way to amicably co-parent. I will not be staying in this relationship long enough for it to emotionally damage my son. NOTHING is more important to me than my son's physical and emotional safety.

Thank you again to everyone who took the time to share their experiences and advice. I feel much less alone than I did this morning. &lt;3 ",TwoXChromosomes,2962,1698336275.0,564,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17gzv7l/my_husband_feels_bombarded_and_i_am_so_tired/
I found the secret to not getting cat called!,"It’s overalls! And not just any overalls, the overly cutesy ones that a 6 year old would be jealous of. 

I like being cool in the summer. I like wearing shorts + tank tops or crop tops. Or dresses. But every year it’s like the crazies emerge and I’m constantly being followed, harassed, yelled at, or having weirdos come up to me. 

The final straw for me was two years ago, I was shopping with my four year old. I was wearing shorts and a tank top. I had no makeup on. We were out in the parking lot garden center, and this man drove up with his door within inches of me and my child. He wanted my “autograph” and my number and got shitty when I said no. 

I felt uncomfortable so we went inside. Where not *ten minutes* later, a guy old enough to be my father walked up to us and graphically described what he wanted to do to my body *in front of my kid.* I decided I was going to try to make sure my husband was with me when I went out. 

Last year my husband told me he loved overalls on me. I’m not gonna lie; I don’t prefer them. But I love him so I bought a pair of pink overalls with strawberries on them. They’re actually really comfy, so this year I decided to wear them more. 

I wore them to the store alone. And I did keep getting approached, but always by women! They’d tell me how cute they were! So I decided to try something new. I bought 3 more pairs of pink overalls with patterns. I wear them every time I go out. 

Men have stopped cat calling me. Women continue to be nice. I think overalls have saved my sanity and my freedom. My daughter continues to be jealous of my cool overalls, but she doesn’t know that I bought her several pairs for her birthday.

I'm 15M. Is this sexual harassment? How to make them stop? How can I talk to her mom/her about this?,"Hopefully this is the right place to post this. My friends and I consist of about 6 (all 15-16 yr olds), along with my twin. We've literally grew up together as we live in the same neighborhood and have for all our lives. All of our parents are friends and we go on trips and such together often. They're like brothers to me, and while we're all stupid teenage boys, they've never done anything too wrong or questionable. Until now

There is this very attractive girl who has just moved into our neighborhood about a month ago. She's 17, so she's not that much older than us, but she is one of the only girls around our age in the neighborhood. Instantly she got our attention, and while I did attempt to flirt with her at first, when she told me she wasn't really interested I left her alone. The rest of my friends weren't so dismissive, and I'm pretty sure they've been harassing her now.

They'll wait for her to come home from her cheer-leading practice, and then whistle at her, and take pictures of her in her uniform. Whenever she walks her dog they'll follow her around trying to talk to her, even after she tells them to leave her alone. Yesterday, they actually grabbed her and tried to force her to hug them, but at that point my brother and I pushed them away from her. She went home and after that they started calling us ""white knights"", and ""cock blockers"". They said they were just having fun and she probably likes the attention.

I really don't think they're going to leave her alone, and to be completely honest we've never had any problems between us before. They mean everything to me but how else are you suppose to tell someone close to you that they're acting fucked up without cursing them out or losing them. If I go and talk to the girl or her mother what should I say?",TwoXChromosomes,12709,1504715433.0,1416,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6ygplk/im_15m_is_this_sexual_harassment_how_to_make_them/
My friend got followed on her way home last night and confronted the guy,"I'm shaking, I cried already because this just terrifies me

Last night my friend and I were at an event of our school (covid safe), and ended up chilling a bit longer with the rest of our group until we both felt a bit tired and decided maybe we should head home. At that moment the group we were with invited us to go along to someone's house and I ended up deciding I wanted to go with them.

She said she would walk home, 20 minutes from where we were. I asked her to stay, then asked the group which way we would go so she didn't have to walk alone long. But we had to go the opposite way and she said she'd be alright. We hugged, promised to see each other the next day, she said she'd call me if she got some trouble. We had both forgotten my phone had died.

Later that night when I charged my phone I got a notification that she had tried to call me and my heart just sunk. Then I got a snapchat where she was in her room, saying she had been stalked on her way by a guy.

When she left us after a while she got on a main walkway across our city that is usually safe at night. Right away when he started following her she noticed. She stopped walking so he could pass her and he turned into a side street further away. She kept waiting, and eventually this guy came out of the street, and walked ahead of her, so she started walking as well thinking he just got lost. Then he turns into a street again, she feels suspicious, tries to call me, my phone dead so she calls another girl friend. She tells her she feels like she is followed, asks how she should proceed because she doesn't want him to see where she lives and maybe come into the apartment hallway with her. After some courage and just before her apartment street she stops, and waits. This guy passes the corner. He stops to look at her. She stares him down, and then tells him to keep walking. Keep walking, Keep walking.The guy asks her what's the problem, he just wants to talk to her.She tells him the problem is he obviously been following her, to leave her alone, she got somebody on the phone.He says he wasn't going to do anything, the shops were closed and it's late, he wanted to talk to somebody.She kept firmly telling him she wasn't interested, it's creepy, keep walking, I want to see you walk in front of me.He's stubborn, doesn't want to go,Frustrated as fuck, she tells him she doesn't want him to see where she is going,He says he doesn't need to go the way she is going, (like he hasn't been following her for a while), that it doesn't matter where he is going. It goes back and forth for a bit longer and he says I'm staying here.She tells him to then stay the fuck there and not to follow her anymore, and decides to keep walking, making sure he isn't following, loudly speaking on the phone.

She was shaking when she got inside, mad and freaked out. THIS ISN'T FUCKING NORMAL. I'm already prepared for men who lurk this subreddit for cheap shots at women to say she should have at least spoken to him a bit, he was probably lonely, he wasn't following her, it's a main street everyone could walk there.WE DO NOT OWE MEN WHO STALK US AND FOLLOW US ANY OF OUR TIME. WE ARE ALLOWED TO WALK DOWN THE STREET. LESBIANS DO NOT STALK WOMEN HOME, THEY DO NOT OGGLE AT US WITH THEIR EYES AND YELL HOW THEY WISH TO FUCK US ON THE STREET WHEN WE PASS, WHY CAN'T MEN DO THE SAME.

And then let's say this guy really was a nice guy, which he wasn't, he lacked the basic awareness that women do not feel safe when a guy walks behind them suspiciously. He didn't think how his actions affected her. If he really just wanted to talk, why wasn't he just a friendly face, that said good evening instead of creepily following her.  Then men say, we don't want to adapt our actions for the small possibility of your discomfort. Guess what, women adapt their actions all the time based on the men or the idea of men in their immediate surroundings. We walk on main streets and avoid side ones and alleys, we avoid or try to avoid to walk alone, we text our friends when we got home and tell them to call us to say they are, we surpress the way we really want to dress so that we aren't oggled at, and even if we did dress more ""provocatively"" that isn't an excuse to be mistreated. ""But women like compliments from other women, why can't I say anything?"" is what is asked then. Because women usually don't only see us as a potential sex opportunity. We know women see us as potential friends, they see us as beings not for their own gratification. That's why. I have yet to meet a women, *or a girl* who hasn't been sexually harrassed by men and boys.

Tonight, I have decided I will not let any of my girlfriends walk alone for a while. This man's actions, for some would seem not that agressive, not violent, why all this drama for a stalker right? But this shit goes deep. Because we as women, have been trained on all these stories in the news and over the passage of history that men rape women, all the time, everywhere, whenever they do and do not suspect it, it doesn't matter in daylight or at night, if she was modestly dressed or not, the only similar factor is that it was a man.

I'm tired, I feel incredibly guilty, I'm going to hug her tight later today

&amp;#x200B;

edit: UPDATE; I saw her today and did hug her tight, she is feeling alright. She explained things more in detail;Apparantly she also told him he made her uncomfortable, and he asked her why she thought that,""Because you followed me for 10 minutes!"" She yelled, and she told me she saw that he was genuingly confused that he had made her uncomfortable. Same for when she told him she was on the phone with someone because of him.

She told me that the moment she had started confronting him, she felt herself in power of the situation and not so scared anymore. She hopes that maybe this interaction will make the weels in his head spin a bit and develop some introspection in his attitude towards women.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: This is in Europe, so we don't carry guns or have gun ranges. Women shouldn't have to carry guns for men to finally leave them alone. Pepper spray is illegal here. Car serviced to bring women places is nice and all but that is not what I'm pleading for. I'm pleading for us to be able to fucking live our lives without men trying to fucking bother us.  Teach men not to see women as objects. By telling women how they can prevent this you are putting the blame in their court.

You just don't know until it happens to you,"In February, I (32 f) was at a gas station after work and saw a guy knock his girlfriend out. He did it in front of everyone at a busy gas station in Baltimore.

Without thinking, I jumped out of my car and screamed at the guy to get the fuck away from her unconscious body. He immediately tried to pick her up and apologize, but when I started to call the cops, he swung at me. Grazed my jaw.

I got in my car and locked the doors. I tried to take video, but I couldn't while on the phone with the police. So I took as many pictures as I could.

This man dragged her body to his car, shook her awake, and made her come and tell me to stop calling the cops. I didn't. So, then, he tried to break into my passenger side door. I backed up to leave, so then he sat on the hood of my car. I managed to drive off without running him over (despite the desire).

Shocking, yes? But, wait, there's more. The majority of my call with 911 during the incident was arguing whether I was in Baltimore City or County. I lived in that neighborhood and knew it was in the city. Still, she transferred me to the county dispatch.

County police arrived and said it was city. But was able to pull his license plate info to help me identify him. After about an hour, the city police arrived, took a report, told me that I need to file charges, and said he will check out the surveillance footage.

I assumed that the state would pursue this incident automatically. I assumed my photos and the surveillance footage would be enough for the state to file charges related to assaulting his girlfriend, assaulting me, trying to break into my car, trying to intimidate me, etc. I assumed the evidence would be damning that I wouldn't have to do anything else. I assumed wrong.

I had to file an assault charge. Me. I had to show up to court as the plaintiff. Me. I had to bring up to the prosecutor the fact that he was already on probation/parole for a previous assault charge. Me. I had take 3 days off work for the district court hearing, the initial circuit court hearing, and the trial. Me. I was the sole witness because no surveillance footage was acquired (for reasons unknown). Me.

Today was the trial. And, about 30 minutes ago, I got the call from the court that he was found guilty. He will be sentenced next Friday.

I bring this all up not because I want to brag about how I put an abuser behind bars. (Ironically, my current job before I go off to law school is providing civil legal services to people who are incarcerated. And, I don't see jail or prison as the best option for many). I bring this up because I never truly understood what it meant for someone to press charges against an abuser. Until now.

It means navigating a system that is tragically overwhelmed and jaded. It means having one of the worst things that has happened to you be treated like a day at the DMV.

Going to court the first time, I had to wait in the hall alongside this man. The second time, I had to pass him twice in the hall to find out I was supposed to be across the street in a completely different building for victims and witnesses. No one told me this. The third time, I was waiting alone in the hall for my moment to testify while they were on break. And, he walked past me in the hall back into the court room.

Each of those times, I felt myself reeling. The term revictimized had a more profound meaning. Not to mention how I had to endure being cross examined by his attorney, who was trying her hardest to make my story seem as if I was the instigator in my assault.

The thing is that I was not especially injured. I did not know this man. And, I feel confident that our paths will never cross again.

But, all I could do was imagine what this experience is like for victims of rape, domestic violence, or something else more violent and personal. The courage it takes to go through all this when the stakes are even higher is underappreciated. And, the reality of not wanting to file charges and not wanting to go through all this is overzealously criticized.

To all of you out there who have had to stand up and fight, I hear you and applaud you. And, I'm sorry you had to go through it, especially if you had to do it all alone. Having someone there to hold your hand makes all the difference.

To all of you out there who did not pursue action, I hear you too. I get why people don't report or take action. And, I'm sorry our system doesn't support you better.

Edit: I'm overwhelmed with support here. Thank you! For some reason, I am not getting access to every single comment, which I am trying to read and respond to accordingly. I'm sorry to anyone I couldn't.

For those of you who have asked for a link or proof that this is the truth, I have two things to say to you:

1. I understand wanting to get more information, but if your motivation is to verify my story (as some have overtly stated), you are part of the problem. Many victims don't report because of the fear of not being believed.

2. I already feel that I have provided too much information that a reasonable person could do this on their own. In fact, I'm a little worried that this post has gotten so much attention that if someone were to find the offender's information from the case docket, they'd be harassed, which may result in further violence or harassment on my part or another.

Any advice on this would be welcome, as he is not going to be incarcerated until his sentencing date.",TwoXChromosomes,27801,1562978197.0,574,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ccizyn/you_just_dont_know_until_it_happens_to_you/
My 13 year old brother has become an Andrew Tate fan and it’s getting scary.,"Idk if I'm dumb and I don't know how to use reddit, but I can't figure out how flairs work so I want to add a trigger warning for mentions of violence and SA.

&amp;#x200B;

*How it started*

I first noticed it what was happening I was driving him and my other sister to the mall on Black Friday. Seemingly out of no where, he asked us why there hasn’t ever been a female president.

In an awkward and maybe difficult to comprehend way, I started to explain that historically positions of power have been limited to a specific demographic and while there aren’t in current laws specifically preventing a woman from being president, no women has had the opportunity yet.

He stopped me at some point and told me that women were just too incompetent hold positions of power and there were a lot of things that men do a whole lot better than women.

As we started to go back on forth on it, I realized what was happening. I’d heard all of these weird manosphere talking points a million times and he was just recycling bad tiktock content.

I don’t want to go to far into the details because it’s a lot but, he’s said and done a lot of way worse stuff since then. Pretty much everyone in our immediately family has tried to talk to him about it (both individual and as a kind of intervention) and has eventually just given up with the hope that it’s just some messed up stage that he’ll eventually grow out of.

He’s was raised as the youngest child and the only boy in a single mom household, so I ever expected him to end up like this. Now, pretty much all of my other sisters keep him at a distance and make occasional jokes to each other about how he’s probably gonna end up in jail for beating women (or worse) when he grows up.

When we used to argue about the dumb misogynistic shit he get’s from the internet, I can see the corners of his mouth curl up into a smile when he get’s me upset or angry. When I ask him how he could take pleasure in seeing someone he cares about in distress, he denies it or mocks me further, he really is becoming a kind of a cruel kid.

&amp;#x200B;

*The incident and me being a bad adult*

The last time I tried to talk to him about this stuff, he ended up getting violent with me and repeatedly punching me in the face. He’s tried to hit me a few times before that but, there had always been family there to hold him back from attacking me.

He’s only 13 but he’s already 5’10 and has strength comparable to an adult man (by comparison I’m like 107 lbs and 5’3). I’d never been hit like that by anybody before and authentically terrified, I ended up having a very embarrassing and loud panic attack and we’ve pretty much kept away from each other ever since.

I’m not completely innocent in the situation. He was defending Andrew Tate and I asked him how he could follow advice from a man who had raped and sexually exploited so many women. He went on to deny any of it ever happened and used a lot of really mean victim blaming rhetoric in Tate’s defense.

At some point, I thought I could get him to take the situations seriously if I told him about some of my SA experiences from the military. He mocked and victim blamed me and I just couldn’t take it. I shoved a 13 yo autistic kid and he immediately went into a rage and started punching me over and over again with as much force as he possibly could as I started sobbing and wailing (quite humiliatingly), curled up into a ball, and tried to use my hand to block as much of the impact as I possibly could. I know I was wrong but I never thought I’d have such traumatic experiences mocked by anyone, let alone my own brother. I can't change the past but I know that'll I'll never do that shit again.

&amp;#x200B;

*Wtf should I even do at this point, if anything*

I don’t know what to do, I hate the kid but I still love him and want to help. He’s on the spectrum and had learning disabilities and I know life isn’t easy for him. I wish I could just hang out with him and get him out the house and interested in new hobbies until he stops caring about stupid manosphere shit but, it’s complicated. I’m not sure if I should just keep away to avoid lashing out and being an asshole to a literal child (or getting myself hurt physically speaking).

I know my mom isn’t the best parent and won’t be much help to him, even though she does try in her own way. Speaking of, my mom avoids certain topics because he has been aggressive and physically threatening to her in the past. When he’s not around, sometimes she half-jokes about how if she tried to take away his computer he’d probably snap and beat the shit out of her.

&amp;#x200B;

*Notes:*

*- I know he needs therapy but all of that’s kind of in my moms hands; she’s interested but has been moving slowly on it, despite my encouragement*

\- *I can’t call the cops on him if he get violent because we’re black and there a slight chance they might shoot one of us for racism and stuff*

*- He's on the spectrum, you can't put a percentage on Autism but it's to the extent where although most people don't notice not neurotypical upon first impression, people with experience working with kids like him are generally pretty quick to pick up on it*

**edit:**

**I was not expecting this post to blow up a little bit. I was super embarrassed about posting this and avoided checking reddit because I felt really guilty about the whole thing and was honestly fully expecting ridicule. I definitely feel less weird and more validated.**

**Last night, I decided to try to have a conversation about everything that happened and everything that lead up to it and offer my friendship and guidance and he was pretty receptive. He's autistic and had a meltdown and feels really bad about hurting me. Asking him a lot of questions while trying be as non-confrontational as possible seemed to help a lot.**

**Also, to all the people saying that he needs juvi, I really don't think that helps kids, it just makes them scared and angry and confused. Also, we're black, getting a little black boy involved with the criminal justice system sometimes ends up becoming a life-long situation.**

&amp;#x200B;

**edit 2:**

**Just to be clear, no one in my family openly mocks or laughs at him. There have been occasional jokes when he's not present, but everyone is almost exclusively kind and supportive in his actual presence.**

**My family and I are a group of deeply unserious people and we generally tend to laugh with each other a lot. I think when they make these jokes, they're kind of a way of acknowledging how serious the situation is without making everyone feel awful and sad.**

**The reality of the situation is if we can't help him before get get's older, he might do something really bad later on in life, and that's a hard pill to swallow. Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.**

**It's not perfectly mature, but we're all our 20's and have some growing up to do. And I'll give my mom a pass because as much as they love each other, he really does put her through hell a regular.**",TwoXChromosomes,3133,1688877671.0,591,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14up4zo/my_13_year_old_brother_has_become_an_andrew_tate/
Customer tries to break into bathroom,"My trans child (22 y o, f to nb) and I both work in a coffee shop that is inside a department store. Yesterday, my kid (I'll call them K) went to use the restroom. They use the family bathroom because it is for any gender. Looking at K, if you dont know them, they look like a 14 - 16 year old boy.

As they got to the bathroom, an older man (65 ish) came out of the men's room. He walked right up behind K. K ran into the family bathroom, pushed the door closed, and locked it. Not a moment later this guy tried to open the door.

Now K is texting me but I'm with a customer so I dont see it. After the customer walks away I check my phone because K has been gone about 5 mins and Im like ???

I see the texts but the guy is a few feet away from the bathroom so at first I thought they were over reacting. As I'm watching however,  he goes over and asks an employee to open the door, then tries the handle again and *pounds* on the door  full force.

I throw my apron off and run over. I call through the door that it's me. I maneuvered to block him from seeing K and K comes out. 

""He's been in there 15 minutes""
Me: he ain't been gone no 15 minutes
""The fuck he hasnt""
Me: well pounding on the door really helped didnt it??

The guy watches us walk back to the café and then goes into the bathroom.

Keep in mind he had just left the men's room, and that he watched K go in and then immediately tried the door. When he came out we have supervisors with us so he knew we told them. He walked around the store and then stared at K the whole time he was cashing out. I was *ready* but he didnt come over.

Yes, we reported everything. K was given the option to press charges but didnt really want the guy provoked any further. However if he returns to the store security will be watching. 

Edit: thank you for the support/concern. K is okay. They clocked out early last night and cried a good long while. They're working today but their fiance (a big ole cis man) went with them and will attend if K uses the rest room. They're gonna use the employee bathroom from now on (we usually dont because it is further away, and usually busy because it's 1 toilet for like 100 people) to avoid any more customers. 

We are thinking the guy wanted to assault K because he tried to open the door quietly at first but got angry when it was locked. As he'd just come out the men's room he obviously didn't have to pee. He saw what he thought was a young boy alone and went for it. 

Edit again: FROM K
So as my mom said, I am a 22-year-old nb person. While working at the café, I decided to take a bathroom break. So I take my apron off, all that jazz, and waddle my happy ass over to the public bathroom. Now earlier that day, something went down that I don't need to go over, but it was... weird. Not bad, no one was hurt, but kids being dumb kids, basically.

So I knock on the family bathroom, hear someone yell they're in there, then just back up and wait. While I'm waiting, the creepy guy came out of the men's and walked slowly past me, all while staring right at me. He went a little ways past me before rounding back to stand a little ways off to the side behind me.

Now I instantly get a bad feeling in my gut. I really shouldn't have gone in, but I had to take a wicked piss. So I go in and shove the door shut fast and click the lock. Mind you, these doors are super heavy and have a thing to make them close slowly, but I was shoving it hard to make it faster. I then went and did my business. I also cannot confirm, but I swear I heard him move towards me as I went in. It was loud in the store, though, so no real idea on if he did.

But now, to be fair, I did get distracted on my phone. By this time of day, it was nearly closing and I had barely been able to even see if anyone messaged me, let alone anything else, the whole shift. So I took the chance to watch a few YouTube shorts. After maybe two, which neither were even close to a minute together, the door handle jingles. Confuses me, but I assume someone thought it was unlocked and tested it. Bear in mind, I still had that bad feeling.

So I go back to my phone and message mom about it, wanting her to come over so I had someone there and wasn't alone, someone suddenly POUNDS on the fucking door. I immediately start tweaking and spamming her I was in danger, that my gut was telling me I would be hurt in some way if I opened the door. Thankfully, during all this, she taught me from a very young age to always trust my gut. This was really the first time in my life I had to even use it.
Originally, she thought I was overreacting. I have issues and disorders that tend to make me blow things outta proportion, so totally understandable. But once he went at the door, she came running. I was starting to have a panic attack when I heard her call to me through the door. Never says my name, though. So I rush to get out, and she walks directly next to me to block me from his view and is snarky to him.

I never heard really what was said, I was way too in my head and panicked to really pay attention and process it. We go back, and I get my apron back on quick because the café was left unattended and there were customers. I rush through drinks, messing them up because I'm still having a panic attack. She lets me go hide in the kitchen, so I go back there and call my fiancée to try and calm down.

I spend about half an hour back there, full on sobbing. Like, I was NOT okay. I end up needing to clock out and just sit in the back of the café where I could see everything and my back to the corner of the room. I cried on and off then, explaining to my boss and other team leaders of the department store what happened, and later on talked to the security of the store. I told them exact times I was in there, thank you Discord, described the man, and told them what happened.

I decided to not press charges despite being able to because I really am praying that it happening to me was a one time thing and not targeted. I also didn't want to rile him up and him do much worse. But the team leaders, store directer, and everyone in charge there and who has any sort of power, they all know who he is and exactly what he looks like due to the cameras. If he tries shit again, they know who to show to the police.

And.. That's about it. Work today was uneventful and honestly quite fun! I was still paranoid, thanks to that all happening, but my fiancée came with me and spent the day just in case, lol.

And thank you to everyone who commented in my mother's post, I read them all, and it really helped me feel like I didn't overreact. Genuinely, from the bottom of my heart, thank you all for the support &lt;3",TwoXChromosomes,2227,1745851097.0,176,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1k9x4s2/customer_tries_to_break_into_bathroom/
A man tried to kiss me outside a bar and pulled my hair to stop me from getting away.,"I was outside a bar with friends having a great time with a small group of guys. One of them was hitting on me all night and saying he wanted to kiss me but I was clear about being in a long term (10+ year) relationship. He managed to corner me when we were all outside smoking and grabbed my face to kiss me and when I turned around and walked away he balled all my hair(waist length) in a ball and yanked me towards him to try again. I managed to break free and put chairs between us.

When we all returned to the bar he tried to get me alone again but when I said no he yelled at me “What the fuck is wrong with you” I immediately wanted to leave and sobbed all the way home with my friends. 

I feel guilty for being nice to him. Is this my fault!? I feel like I’ve been assaulted. Have I been? Am I being overly dramatic? I feel so upset and violated right now.

Edit:

I feel like I should clarify some things. 

We are currently in a foreign country where people generally say not to trust the police. If I were in my home country I want to say I would have reacted differently but I felt completely and totally unsafe making a scene. He is gone from the resort today and unfortunately I do not have any of his information.

I was not with my SO because we are on an all girls trip.

No one really saw what he did since we smoked in a huge gazebo and I went to a corner to separate myself from the group since he was making me uncomfortable. Imagine a circle of people around a table talking and me behind them about 10 feet back in the dark. In hindsight I should have not separated myself from the group and vocalized my feelings towards him to my friends more outwardly. It’s was a horrible situation all around but I have learned from it. I will never ever enable someone like this to be alone with me again especially where they could easily follow me to my room and be ready to strike.

Also, thanks to everyone who is encouraging me to quit smoking. I did quit smoking in 2020 but I do have the scattered cigarette when on vacation.

As for the people who have commented on my mental health… yes I do struggle with mental health. How dare you take away from victims of abuse because they have mental health issues as if that changes the situation at all.

That’s all I really have to say. I think I’m still in shock today but I am so grateful for your support.",TwoXChromosomes,6294,1681716625.0,321,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/12p6np0/a_man_tried_to_kiss_me_outside_a_bar_and_pulled/
My Husband thought he had Coronavirus but has Leukemia instead.,"I have no idea where to post this but could really use some support right now. My husband and I live in Michigan. As some of you might know, michigan is kind of a hotspot for the coronavirus right now. We had been in quarantine since before the start of the stay at home order. However on April first, my husband started to have a fever and a cough. 

Things slowly started to get worse. About 4 days after he started feeling sick, I started to have symptoms. We were both experiencing the same types of things, fever, chills, fatigue, and a dry cough. We thought for sure this was the beginning of the virus. 

I would be considered a high risk person to get the virus. I am overweight and have preexisting conditions. Naturally I was concerned for myself, my husband is a fit, 26 year old man, who has no pre existing conditions. I figured he would be just fine. 

All of the sudden I was starting to get better. I started to have energy to do things again, while my husband just gradually started to decline. One night he passed out because his blood oxygen level got too low. When the ambulance arrived, they told me that he was fine after taking his vitals and that he just needed to take it easy. 

Every single time my husband would stand up, his blood oxygen would tank. And by tank, I mean 80s or 70s. He insisted that he was fine because the EMT's said he was fine. I argued with him for hours trying to get him to go to the hospital, but he refused. He was scared to go because of the virus, the lack of supplies, the shortage of staff and he didn't want to take up space for someone else. But mostly he didn't want to be left alone. 

I finally gave up and agreed to let him stay home. For the next few days, I took care of him. He would move the bare minimum. I was constantly waking up during the night to check his vitals and waiting on him hand and foot. He was just so sick. The day before he went to the hospital he slept for about 16 hours, longer then I had ever seen him sleep before. 

The day he went in he had a final exam. He was just so sick that he couldn't take it. He was freaking out because yet again, he was struggling to breath. He would walk about 15 feet to go sit on the couch and be so short of breath that he couldn't even speak. He finally agreed to go in, fully expecting to only be in the hospital for a short period of time. 

When we got there they rushed him back. I had to yell I love you and goodbye from the door. I didn't get to hold his hand, or hug him goodbye. He was just taken back and I was told to go home. 

Thankfully he is in a good hospital where they worked extremely fast. Running initial blood work showed that his hemoglobin was at 3, making this life threatening. In less than four hours, he was diagnosed with AML leukemia. Our world had been flipped upside down. His short hospital stay had turned in to 4 weeks. Our whole future has been put into question. All of the sudden we went from thinking it was the virus to talking about chemotherapy and fertility problems. 

Worst of all is the waiting. We are still waiting for the results from the gene study that determines which subtype of AML leukemia he has. This determines how treatable it is and what we can do moving forward. He is already well into chemo and doing his best to fight this. He has developed a mild pneumonia to top it all off and has trouble talking for longer than a few minutes without hacking up a lung. If we video chat he gets emotional because he just wants nothing more than to come home. 

Here is why I think this is appropriate to post here. My heart is broken as a women. My whole life plan has been put into question. I don't know if we will ever be able to have children or grow old together. I don't know what to expect or where this will go. 

This is even worse considering that the pandemic is going on. I am now at home alone with my thoughts. I am not allowed to go see him at all. I am not allowed to go see my family at all because they are all high risk for the virus. I am not allowed to even go do normal ass things like go to the grocery store without fear. 

This is my worst nightmare. I have been through one hell of a lot in my life but this is easily the most difficult thing I will ever go through. My heart is breaking because the most important person in the world to me is hurting so badly and there is nothing I can do. Everyday here alone is my own personal hell. I have no idea how we are going to get through this. My heart just hurts and I am scared. 

Sorry for the long rant. I am just not doing okay.

Also if you think you have the virus, this is why you should try to get tested.. it could be something else. Including something much, much worse.",TwoXChromosomes,15421,1587598091.0,543,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/g6bwdp/my_husband_thought_he_had_coronavirus_but_has/
"Today, I scared off a creeper following 2 preteen girls.","Today, I (40f) took my toddler to a nearby playground park. The park is right next to a middle school, and we heard school let out while my kid was playing. 

A few minutes later, 2 preteen girls (12-13yo?) walk thru the playground to hang out on the swing set. Giggling and talking to each other. But about 15-20ft behind them was a 30-40yo strung out creeper dude who couldn't take his eyes off them. My gut was screaming he was up to no good. He looked high as fuck on meth. Before the girls arrived, I had already picked up my kid to walk back to our car. But as we walked closer to the entrance, I heard the creep was mumbling ""I shouldn't, I shouldn't. Not now."" He saw me watching him like a hawk. We made eye contact and he immediately turned around and started walking out of the park. But he kept stopping to look at 'hiding' spots within eyeline to the playground (behind a big tree, behind the bathroom building, and next to a big forest) I kept positioning myself in a way so he could still see I was very obviously watching him. 

The park was very big, and there were others there, but nowhere near the playground. So I lingered with my kid. Watching as the creep left the park grounds and wobbled down the street.

I quietly approached the girls and asked if they knew that guy. They didn't even realize there was anyone behind them. I calmly described him and said he followed them into the playground and to keep a good eye out as they went home. Asked them to please be safe. I apologized for saying something so scary, but I wanted them to stay out of harm's way.

What made me most sad was one girl was terrified, the other was completely unphased and said ""I've been stalked before. I'll pay better attention."" The one girl was about to cry, the other  acted like it was no big deal.

I called the cops and reported the creep at the park. He had walked away down the street by that point, but I couldn't shake that feeling that I was meant to be there at that exact moment.

I’m having an abortion 3 months after my daughter was born,"When i was pregnant with my daughter i felt like it was a blessing. the moment i saw the 2 lines i got so happy. we weren’t trying and she was a complete accident but i was still ecstatic to be carrying life.  

it’s been 3 months and i love her dearly. i’m a SAHM and i love spending my days with her, although i do get very much needed breaks. she is just the light of my life and everything i do is for her. me and my husband agreed this will be our one and only child because it worked for us.

2 days ago i saw those familiar lines again. this time happiness did not come right away. this time i was pissed. this time i cursed in my pillow until my face was blue. i cried myself to sleep that night. it was different this time. i felt my plans to go back to school fade away. i saw 2 babies in diapers. i saw 2 babies to feed. i saw two doctor bills, two school payments, two of everything. i saw my attention, time and money being taken away from my daughter who is just an infant right now herself. 

1 day ago i scheduled an abortion consultant. i feel incredibly stupid for getting pregnant again. i feel ashamed in having my daughter but choosing to end this pregnancy. i am firm and secure that this is the best decision for my family but the guilt is eating me alive. if i’m being 100% honest i’m scared to even post this. we haven’t told anyone and we’re not going to. i just needed to put my thoughts and feelings out there. thanks for listening.

EDIt: 
just wanted to add because i might be a lot of questions i was on two different types of birth control both times. the depo shot and then the mini pill because i still breastfed my daughter

edit: 
i didn’t know expect this much support thank you everyone for the kind words. last night i was thinking about it and i am still firm in my decision to choose abortion. my guilt is coming from a mix of the fact that this happened again,  society expectations that since i have had my daughter that i’m suppose to have any and all pregnancies following her and my daughter loosing a potential sibling. but those are not dealbreakers to me. yes they are making me feel like shit right now but my decision is strong that i am not mentally, physically and financially ready for another baby SO soon. abortion right now in this circumstances is right for me and my family. again thank you everyone for the kind words they are very much appreciated in a dark time in my life.",TwoXChromosomes,7975,1570948269.0,945,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dh70la/im_having_an_abortion_3_months_after_my_daughter/
"Today, I could not have been more thankful to run into that ""annoying neighbour""","First time poster here ... To start this off right let me say that Mitch is not annoying, but there are times I just want to peacefully enjoy my walk with my dog, and really don't want to engage in conversation with anyone, and times I've been trapped in a conversation or two where all I want to do is escape. 

Well, this evening was a completely different story. I live in a condo complex that has 5 buildings. I was leaving the complex to walk my dog when I spotted a driver who had stopped and was staring at me. I thought nothing of it, kept walking as he drove away slowly and carried on getting off the property and to the park. Well, I get to the street, and sure enough the same car is sitting there, we make eye contact, he stares for a couple more seconds and drives away. By this point my guards are up, the way he looked me up and down sent chills up my spine. I keep walking down the street, main goal being to get inside the semi-busy park and surround myself with people, when sure enough this same car turns the corner back onto the street I'm walking down and I notice he begins to slow down. As soon as I saw him I thought, grab your phone and pretend you have a call. So I'm walking down the street, talking to myself and he drives by very slow and gives me that look again. Once he passed and I saw him turn back into my complex I hauled ass to the park where I stopped to gather my thoughts, and this is where Mitch came over. 

He came up to me, we did our usual hello's and he paused for a moment before he said ""I don't mean to intrude, but I noticed while you were walking, you kept looking over your shoulder a lot. Are you ok?"" At that moment I didn't know if I told him what was happening if he would think I was overreacting, or if he would understand why I felt scared. I explained what was happening, and without even batting an eye he said ""My pup and I would like to continue our walk with you, if you feel comfortable with that?"". Of course I said yes, and we carried on through the park. I felt my shoulders relax and knew I was safe. 

Once we got to the point where my walk would end he said ""Would you like me to walk you to your building (the farthest away) just to make sure everything is ok?"" My response was, nah I think I'm ok, what are the odds of him sticking around ... 2 seconds later, he pulls out of the complex again, and gives me the creepy stare before he drives off. At that point, without hesitation Mitch says ""Let's carry on"". As we are walking he so calmly says to me ""If I see that car again, I am going to gently take your hand in mine as if we are a couple, as long as you are ok with that? And if so I need you to do two things. Nod in agreement, and move your leash to your other hand so your hand closest to me is available"". I didn't have to think twice, I nodded as I moved the leash and we continued to walk and carry on conversation like nothing had happened. 

I got to my building's main entrance safely, and I didn't know what to say. I couldn't thank this man enough for being so protective of me, a woman he had only had a few interactions with here and there. It was then he took a few minutes to explain his background, and it made a lot more sense. He was an ex-Israeli soldier who left Israel when his Mom was constantly being abused by his Father and no one would help. He used all his money to move his Mom, little sister and their family dog to a safe place far away from his Father until he could join them. He said it was at that point, he decided he would do everything in his power to ensure women felt safe and secure, no matter the circumstances. 

I learned a lot tonight, and I feel like if it weren't for Mitch, something bad could have happened. I appreciated his soft, consensual approach to me, especially when he could see I was struggling and stressed. The world needs more men like Mitch.





***UPDATE: Firstly, OMG you guys. I have never felt soooo loved and heard from a group of strangers. Honestly you guys made my day. Waking up and seeing all of your responses, I couldn't help but cry. You are all an amazing group of humans and thank you again for the support 🩷

I went and filed a police report after work, with as much detail as I had, model of the car, colour, description of the guy. Sadly my brain went into panic mode and I did not get the license plate. I also notified the condo management company and they in turn have advised our security to be on the lookout. Again thank you everyone for all of your suggestions, and words of encouragement. 

Secondly, some of you are both hilarious and have very twisted minds lol. Trust me, this was not some creepy set up by Mitch. His reactions to me were very genuine, and I could not be more grateful for him and everything he did. 

Lastly, for those who are saying my title was mean or that I didn't appreciate Mitch by referring to the ""annoying neighbour"". I think I made it very clear that I DO NOT see him that way at all, and I am extremely, EXTREMELY grateful for his help last night. I cried when I got home before I posted this because I was so overwhelmed with his kindness and support. I kept asking him how I could pay him back, but he said there was no need. Just to stay safe, and come find him if I ever need his help. I'm sorry that out of my entire post, all you could focus on was the title. That really was not the point of me sharing.

Oh and really lastly lol I don't know if he's married/single/in a relationship 😂 he didn't mention this while we were walking and talking.

I went to the police station armed with my video. I told the policeman I already talked with them on the phone and they instructed me to record him. The policeman (let's call him best-cop-ever) took it very seriously from the start. I made it clear that i am scared of this guy and i don't want him to know about me going to the police. Best-cop-ever responded:

""Don't be scared of guys like this. After we're done with him he will never bother you again. From now on you have us to protect you. If you want we can even take him in custody. Wait for me to finish some paperwork and we will go face him together"". 

Of course I was scared shitless but a little voice in me said ""go girl, look this perv in the eyes, stop being scared of men, this is your chance."" So I agreed.

So best-cop-ever took me and 2 more policemen and we walked until my street. I showed him where I live, where his balcony is and everything. He rang every doorbell in his building, and then we went up the stairs and asked any neighbor we could find for info. Finally we arrived to his apartment and were met with 2 teenage boys. The best-cop-ever zoomed in the video on his phone to show them the face without showing the act. The boys both claimed this was their dad and that he is at work.

The cops told the boys some fake story, and told them to call their dad and tell him to make it his priority to call the chief of police (of the local department). They said it isnt anything bad and they shouldn't worry. They also took the personal info of the dad. We walked in the apartment to check the view from his masturbating position and my balcony is perfectly visible. Not only that, I noticed he deliberately put a chair in front of the window every night to be able to see me, because there was no chair at the moment where he usually sits. At that point I remembered that the first time I saw him masturbate he was siting on the couch, but later, when it started becoming a daily thing, he moved closer to the balcony door. 

We left and I thanked all of them. Later in the day best-cop-ever texted me that the guy arrived in the police department. I asked how it went and he texted me that it went great and he promised never to do it again.

In my country there is a very strong anti-police sentiment and I have to say my views have changed after this incident. I understand all the problems of the police but I cannot ignore how amazingly best-cop-ever and his co-workers handled my case. I will be forever grateful!

This happened yesterday and masturbating neighbor finally learned how to draw his curtains (yeaaa). What a win. I hope I will  never see his dick again, but if i do i know i have a support system now! I do get a bit paranoid though and I am very careful when I enter and exit my building just in case. But so far so good.

Thanks for the support! I have been scared of perverts due to traumatic experiences since years and this is the first time I react. It was hard but now I feel way stronger than before. Hopefully this guy learned his lesson. Much love to everybody!

I don’t think men understand how much we fear them,"I’m working out by myself in a somewhat rural area (22F) and my store closes at 7:45 automatically, auto locking the door. Last night while closing alone a man came to the shop door at 7:45 exactly. I had forgotten to turn the neon open sign off so I apologized and told him we were closed. All the while this man is continuing to aggressively try and open the door. I’m refusing to let him in shocked as this man keeps trying to open the door despite me standing there and telling him we are closed repeatedly. The man then tells me that I can let him in because he’s “not A…” he literally said that and then stopped himself when he realized what he was about to say. This man then tells me (through the glass door) that he is having car troubles and asks if he can stay in our parking lot. There is a gas station right down the street. I assumed his car was broken down here though so I told him that was fine. I waited to leave the store until I knew he was actually there for car assistance and not just waiting for me to get off.  Flash to this morning, I open the store again. The same man from last night I witnessed getting road assistance is still in the parking lot. He sees me get out of my car and I am trying to get inside to open the store on time, he decides to try and flag me down for something. I straight bolted into the store and as I’m sitting here typing this he’s still in the parking lot. I truly think he is clueless that I find him off putting in anyway. I also don’t see how he doesn’t get the hint I was scared/ am scared of him.

Edit: am I crazy or justified in feeling this way? Idk.

Update: I have texted my coworkers to warn them of this situation in case he returns. I also forgot to mention that I feel as if he was trying to gauge if I was alone or not because he specifically asked if I had a manager there I could tell (in regards to him parking there). Overall gives me the heebie jeebies. If he returns again I will be calling the Non emergency line to have someone come and tell him what is up. I will be taking no chances to make this weird man feel comfortable.",TwoXChromosomes,2846,1695741315.0,460,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/16sqqq8/i_dont_think_men_understand_how_much_we_fear_them/
"I was almost abducted at 19 at my work and when I reported it minutes after, they did nothing","Worked at a grocery store for 2 days. I bagged groceries. Rule was you HAD to walk the bags out to the customer's car if they asked.

My second day where I actually started, I had a few nice ladies who needed help to their car. And then this older guy in his 50s comes up.

He had maybe 4 things and saw that I had just come back from helping someone. He kept smiling at me and I felt creeped out, but customer service meant smiling and being polite.

He then asked that I take the one bag to his car. I looked at my cashier and at my boss who was at the front of the store. No one stopped, no one thought it was weird.

I was about 120lbs and 19 years old. As I walked out he told me he picked my aisle on purpose. That he wanted to get me away from there.

When we got to his car, he doesnt open his trunk, he opens the front seat driver side of the car. He has me pinned between his car and the one he is parked next to, with him blocking my only exit.

He then starts to say he has a cabin and wants to take me there. He says he will take good care of me. I politely say I have to get back to work. He says, ""you wont have to work with me"".

He has me there for 20 minutes by now, no one has come. I'm alone in the parking lot. He is now starting to get closer and keeps inisiting I leave with him and that I am pretty.

I say my boss is going to come out and I have to go. He looks angry. I put his bag in, making sure I dont stick my head in so he cant push me. I quickly push his door closed and run back inside.

I'm in tears. Hysterical. I went to the manager who brought me to the security room in the back. I ask them if they got it on tape and they didnt even look. I describe the man to them and the situation. They didnt call the cops and tell me to get back to work. I then ask if I can refuse to walk to a car if I feel unsafe. THEY SAY NO, ITS PART OF MY JOB.

I quit on the spot. Never get a call. No follow up.

I felr ashamed because I lost my job and my feeling of safety all in one day.

I learned several life lessons that day.
1. No one will believe you
2. No one will care
3. You are on your own
And 4. No justice will ever come out of telling

That was 12 years ago, since then I've been sexually assaulted twice after that. Once at an office job and once by a good friend of the family. I've also received verbal sexual harassment at another office job.

Now I make sure I don't wear too much makeup, I dress extremely modest, I leave my work before everyone else, and I dont go grocery shopping alone.

Update: I expected to just get a few responses so wow! I was up late last night and just felt like I had to post this somewhere. At first I did it on my facebook but chickened out and deleted that. So I posted it here. I had mentioned it on facebook a few years back without the details and my dad came out and commented that it never happened. I remember I went to my parents and told them the day it happened, I remember him not believing me and then later acting like I overreacted. He was really pissed that I had quit. Now he doesnt remember...

I was 19 and was scared. I was still in that mentality that most adults are right. I went to my parents and they were more angry at me. So I was afraid to call the cops. 

Also, the 20 minutes he stared at me and talked about his bikes and his cabin. I was sweating bullets and frozen. He was parked next to a car and had the driver door open and I was between his car door and him.


Thank you to everyone who commented with support. Even if there isnt any justice for what happened, it has been very liberating knowing i have at least been heard and believed. 

Also, some of the comments are awful. But I've learn to laugh at most of it.

Single Ladies: Do Not Rely on your Coupled-Up Friends to Look Out for You,"This is my annual cautionary tale to single ladies during the holidays: do not rely on your friends who are in couples to look out for you. It doesn't matter how long you've known them. The only person you can rely on is yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Four years ago I attended a wedding of two close friends in Philadelphia. During the reception, someone stole my phone thinking it belonged to the bride. I knew my phone was missing, but I was with friends, staying in an AirBNB with 9 other people, so I figured I could catch a ride with one of them to get back to the AirBNB.

Wrong.

The reception hall closed around 10pm, so a bunch of people (including most of my AirBNB housemates) took Ubers to a local bar. We were having a great time until about 2am. Someone in the group said it was time to leave, so I told my housemates that I would go pay my bar tab and be right back. By the time I paid my bar tab and got back to the group, they had already gotten in their Ubers and left. At this point, I was in a city I'd never been to before, without a phone, in the middle of the night, alone. I stayed at the bar for awhile thinking SURELY one of the NINE people I was sharing a house with would notice I wasn't there. 

Only one person noticed I wasn't there. She also happened to be the only other person in the house who didn't bring a plus one. 

She brought up fact that I hadn't come back to some of the other people in the house **who insisted I must have gone home with some guy from the wedding.** So not only did these people, people I had known for over five years at that point, not notice I wasn't there, but when it was pointed out to them, they literally didn't care. Why didn't they care? Because they were too focused on their dates. It is worth mentioning that everyone in this group was in their late 20s/early 30s. These are not college kids drunk at a bar. These are reliable professionals. Until they aren't.

These people knew I didn't have my phone. They knew I was in an unfamiliar city. And they abandoned me. After eventually getting booted from the bar around 2:15/2:30am when it finally closed, I wandered the streets of Fishtown by myself, inebriated, with no idea where I was or how to get back to my AirBNB, wearing a party dress and flip-flops, until 4:30am. I was terrified. I walked until I recognized my car, then banged on the door of my AirBNB sobbing until the ONE person who knew I was in trouble found me. Everyone else had gone to sleep. 

No one called the cops. No one went to look for me. Prior to this event, I would have trusted these people with my life. Now, I only trust one of them, and I have mostly cut contact with the other 8.

Do not trust your friends in couples to look out for you this holiday season. You cannot rely on them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: People keep replying that I should have had the bar call a taxi. Call a taxi to take me where? I didn’t have the address of the Airbnb memorized because I had the address *in my phone*. I didn’t think I’d need to memorize it. Also, you can’t log into Airbnb without your phone number receiving a text. The only way I got back to the Airbnb was by walking until I recognized my car.

Also, to be clear, I know now that my friends were shitty friends. That’s why I’m not friends with them anymore. But most people don’t know how far their friends will (or won’t) go for them until you’re in a situation like this. Which is why my advice is to never rely on friends, even ones you think are trustworthy. DO NOT go out if you have no independent way of getting yourself home. Write down your address. Memorize a reliable friend’s phone number. These are all things I’ve done since, but things that I didn’t know I needed to do.",TwoXChromosomes,3314,1670130848.0,609,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zc18tm/single_ladies_do_not_rely_on_your_coupledup/
"I feel really bad for breaking off my 6 year friendship with a guy, but I feel he did something unforgivable.","So my friend(34) wanted to go star gazing with me (34), and told me we were going to a popular beach with Christmas lights and a pier. 

Instead he drove out in the middle of nowhere to a sketchy abandoned parking lot (I guess some sort of parking lot that leads to hiking trails) late at night. I felt very afraid. 

There were only two other vehicles there. A white van with two sketchy guys weirdly loading things and exchanging things in the back. And a giant truck with a guy smoking in it. 

I was too scared to leave the car becuase I was in a cute dress suited for the pier and for a nice dinner. My friend stubbornly left me in the car alone for 40 minutes to go use his camera equipment to take pictures of the stars.

I begged him several times that I didn't feel safe and that this wasn't the plan, which was to see christmas lights at the pier.

He just said ""I could do these things alone, you know. I dont actually need you here.""

Then on the way home, I was very upset. He basically made jokes that I was old and who would want to kidnap me anyways. 

I didn't talk to him for 2 weeks, but last night I gave him a chance to apologize and met with him. Instead he made awkward jokes the whole night about how everyone must want to kidnap me in my fantasy. 

Then he drove me around to do chores like shop for Christmas, and refused to do any stops I wanted or bring me back for hours. Additionally, on the phone he was super rude to his own mother. I was trapped again becuase he was the driver. 

I just followed along quietly trying to put on a good face, so I could get home.

When we got back to his place, he actually had the audacity to try to follow me for a hug goodbye, and I literally just bolted to my car and drove off. 

Idk, even though there is absolutely no reason I should blame myself for getting rid of this friend, I still feel so sad to do so. 

Ever since his father died 3 years ago, he has not been the same person. To everyone else he is an angel. He only seems to save this bad treatment for me.

Edit to clarify: IDK if he wanted a hug. We are only platonic and he is not into me at all (he's not into women and doesn't want any relationships with anyone). I just basically dashed off to my car and said bye quickly, and he's like ""Oh, That's all? Okay...""",TwoXChromosomes,3461,1702939961.0,310,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/18lm3uf/i_feel_really_bad_for_breaking_off_my_6_year/
I want to share my story of being married to a sociopath,"I (41f) married my ex (39m) after a year of dating. In the beginning, he seemed like the perfect catch. Charming, hardworking, hilarious, down to earth, interesting, very loving, very supportive. I had moved in with him after about 8 months of dating. Soon after, he asked me to marry him. I remember feeling so happy and excited then. I felt like I had finally met the love of my life. But as time went on, he started showing signs that something was off.

He was also hiding his alcoholism. Which turned into him being full blown plastered every night. The best part was that I would get home later. I knew as I was driving home, I would be coming home to him drunk and pissed off. In the beginning, he would casually drink. Come to find out, after finding his bottle stash that he was drinking every night. Hiding bottles in dressers, closets, the garage. He was constantly lying about his drinking.

He would get upset about every little thing I did. I constantly felt like I was walking on eggshells. One of my favorite hobbies is coloring with markers - it's very therapeutic and relaxing for me. I remember trying to color next to him on the couch, and we got in an argument about how I wasn't paying enough attention to him. I eventually stopped coloring completely. Because I knew it would just end up in an argument. I stopped doing every single thing that brought me joy. Every single thing. He was slowly but surely manipulating me into being his perfect, submissive shell of a wife.

It didn't matter what I did, everything I did was wrong. I couldn't say the right thing, I couldn't do the right thing, nothing I did was ever enough. I work full time, would get groceries, clean the house, constantly picking up his mess. In the winter, when his work got slower, I would cover all the bills and food. I was constantly broke because of this. I would come home after a long day to him being off work that day and already drunk. I remember getting a lot of ""hey bud,"" ""wasup dude,"" ""hey sailor"" greetings when I walked through the door. I knew my night was going to be hell. Every night was a living hell.

I learned how to be compliant. I basically completely, totally lost myself and my whole goal was to keep him from snapping. So I stopped saying my opinion about anything, I stopped even talking sometimes because what he had to say was more important than anything I thought or felt. I was constantly agreeing with him. Even though I knew he was wrong. He could say the sky was red, and I would agree. Anything I could do to keep him from going into a - breaking things, screaming at me, stomping around the house, threatening me or my cats...nightmare that was my life. I was constantly on edge. I had this feeling like my life was constantly being threatened or my welfare was always in danger.

He would hurt my cats. My older cat Billy would be laying in bed, and he'd just kick her off the bed because she was in the way. She's 12 years old and I could tell it hurt her. The worst feeling in the world was not being able to stand up for them because I knew at any moment he could snap. He would chase Pepper around the house ""playing"" but I knew she was uncomfortable and hated it. She learned, eventually like I did, you can hide from him and in his drunken idiocy, he won't find you. I learned to find all the good hiding spots in the house so that he would just pass out in bed and leave me alone. It made me sick that I had put my cats in this unsafe environment. It made me sick to see them being abused and feeling so afraid, that I couldn't do anything about it.

He would gaslight me. At the time, I was being manipulated so bad, I don't think I could tell up from down. I remember there was this constant argument that I would tell a story and he would later ""figure out"" that I was lying. In his mind, this story really happened...I went to a drug dealer with my ex. Had sex with the drug dealer in exchange for drugs. And my ex had pulled a gun out on the drug dealer after some disagreement. This of course never happened. And I never told this story but in his mind I was constantly lying. I would constantly feel like I was losing my mind. Things like ""you said your favorite band was \_\_\_\_ the other day, why are you lying to me?""

Sex was always an issue. Either we weren't having enough sex - which it was at worst every other day or few days. Or he was having performance issues that were my fault. There were times when I didn't want to have sex, but I would anyways, because he was so drunk and out of his mind that I feared what would happen if I said no. So I learned to just do what makes him happy. At least then, I wouldn't be hurt physically. I had to stop having sex one night because my blood sugar was dropping and I was feeling light headed. Which turned into him screaming at me as I'm sitting in the kitchen waiting for my blood sugar to get back to normal. Wouldn't help me. Didn't care about how I was feeling.

He would just scream at me over everything. One time, I had about a week off work for Christmas break. He had to go back to work, while I had 3 more days off. He went to bed and started yelling things like ""no, no this is bullshit. Why do I have to go to work and you get to sit on your ass all day. Fuck this shit."" Proceeded to come up and scream at me for having more 'time off' than him. I ended up going outside and hiding in the neighbor's yard just to get away from him.

One night, he drunkenly falls down the stairs. Fell down a tall stairway onto the basement floor and hit his head hard. I was upstairs using the restroom and didn't hear it. He bolts upstairs and starts screaming at me ""why the fuck aren't you helping me, I just fell down the stairs you fucking bitch, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you..."" And I just froze. I learned early on to just stop talking and take the hateful talk. No matter what I did. I just had to agree with him, so he wouldn't hurt me. He was dangerously violent. I started to feel like I was on the verge of being horribly hurt physically or killed. One night he was ""showing me a karate move"" and ""accidentally"" punched my nose hard. My nose bled. I didn't go to the hospital because I pulled the ""I'm fine."" There is no doubt in my mind that he did it on purpose.

The last time I ever saw him was when I went back to him briefly after moving out. I went to bed at midnight. He wanted to stay up to finish his drink. I had a long work week and was exhausted. I like catching up on sleep on the weekends. So he had come to bed at 3am trying to get fresh with me. I woke up to him feeling me up basically. I said no and rolled over with my back towards him. He continued to touch me, uncomfortably. I rolled back over to face him and he was staring at me with this look that was absolutely terrifying. It looked like his pupils were dilated. The only way I can describe it was pure evil in his eyes. He was making fists in the air. I said ""are you awake?"" and he then squeezed me way too hard like he was trying to hug me. I knew it was intentional. He would do things often where he would be way too strong armed with me as a point of - you're not following my every whim and I'm going to hurt you enough to where it couldn't be viewed as 'violent.' But you can feel when someone is being too strong with you. He was upset because he wasn't getting any and wanted to hurt me as punishment, I believe. I got my stuff and drove home at 3am.

He was diagnosed as sociopathic. I do believe he is narcissistic as well. He's also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and autism. I have bipolar (medicated), autism, and major depressive disorder. Trying to navigate how to heal from this has been very hard. I feel lost and lonely at times. Trying to figure out what I need to do to heal all the damage that's been done. It feels daunting sometimes.

Even though I've been away for months, I still feel severe PTSD. I can start remembering something that happened, and need to instantly throw up. I know the trauma is still there. I know it will take time to heal. But I feel like I'm losing my mind. Somehow, even with all the horrible stuff he's done, I can still remember the good times and have some sort of nostalgia over his good qualities. But the truth is, he is volatile, manipulative, and incredibly dangerous. I know that now.

I guess the feeling I'm dealing with now is that I can never recover mentally from this. I don't want to look at my future, like I'll be unable to find love again or even trust people. I don't want to be around anyone. I go home at night and watch TV with my cats. It's the only place I feel safe anymore. I don't know if I could ever trust a person again to let them in my heart - friend or whatever. I battle with being frustrated with myself for staying so long. And guilt that my cats were in such a horrible environment because of me. I love them more than anything. And it still haunts me - everything that happened.

I hope that this post can help someone in an abusive situation get the courage to get out. I was able to get out thanks to my family. I truly believe if I stayed, I would be dead by now at his hands. If you're in an abusive situation, there are a lot of people going through the same things. If you feel any kind of negativity about your partner/spouse or intuition telling you this person is very bad for you, please listen to it before it's too late.

Had a concerning experience at the gym today,"I’m a young mom (five months postpartum) and today a man walked up to me in the gym to say “you’re skinny now, that’s good, a few months ago you were like this” and with his hands gestured having a large stomach (I had a baby five months ago). He then proceeded to follow me around the gym trying to coach me on my workout then asked if I was in the gym because “females get depressed about how big they get when they have kids”. I genuinely didn’t know what to say and I’m not proud of it but I kind of just ignored him and now I am considering switching gyms because that is the third time in the last few months I’ve experienced harassment there to that level.

I want to crawl out of my skin after that interaction. How could I have handled this better and what can I do to avoid further situations like this? Like I said, I’ve had several instances of harassment at that gym now.

UPDATE- I reported the incident to the gym and they plan on having a talk with the guy about appropriate conduct in the gym so it should be resolved. In the meantime I’m gonna start learning to stop being so nice for the future.

neighbor having a crush on me ruining my life,"my (26f) older, married neighbor (60sm) and i had a weird interaction yesterday and it's making me fearful to leave my apartment and go on walks with my dog. 

this neighbor lives in the apartment building across from me, but i frequently take my dog out in that area because he doesn't like to use the bathroom near my apartment. this neighbor has a dog he walks that's befriended my dog so we talk occasionally. 

yesterday, i ran into this neighbor while walking my dog. he started following me to start a conversation, and was saying and doing a lot of weird things. this includes touching my hair because he ""liked the color of it"" and asking me if what i was wearing was what i wore to bed and that he ""usually wears nothing because it's so hot."" 

eventually i walked away but when i circled back to my apartment he appeared out of nowhere and wanted to continue the conversation. he started asking me what my car i drove and where it was parked and if i was ""happy"" because supposedly he saw me crying from my window (for context: my room faces the main street, so if you're absolutely looking through you can see my room - which i've noticed he does every time he passes by). he then asked me if i liked dancing and if he could take me out, which i thought was a joke. then he asked me about my boyfriend, who he's met a few times, and started going on a tangent about how he should ""be here with me more often"" and ""take me out more."" 

the real kicker was when he asked me for a hug and for my number so he could ""call me"" and i immediately told him ""no."" he called out to me and said it makes his heart happy when he sees me and i rushed back to my apartment. 

i've told my dad and my boyfriend about the interaction, and i'm considering talking to the man's son to ask him to tell his dad to lay off. but as someone who's been previous SA-ed and harassed, it gives me so much anxiety to be in situations like this to the point it's thrown my entire routine into a loop and i hate it.

A men pretended to chase me while I was on a run. I’m still really shaken,"I was on a run around 6pm on NYE. It was dark, but I stuck to residential lit streets in (what I thought was) a safe neighborhood.

I have 3 blocks left, and I pass a man who is walking in the same direction I was running. He turned around and shuffled, almost like how basketball players do when they’re playing defense. My stupid ass gave him the benefit of the doubt as I ran past— “oh I must have scared him coming from behind”. Nope, the man was pretending to grab me.

I keep running, glance over my shoulder and the man is RUNNING AFTER ME. I screamed and started sprinting, and he stopped and laughed at me, like it was the funniest joke in the world. I shouldn’t have done this, but I started screaming expletives at him.

I kept sprinting, on the verge of tears and luckily I ran into my neighbors walking who walked me the rest of the way to my door. I’m still really shaken, and needless to say I ordered some pepper spray to take with me running from now on.

It’s 2022, how do men not recognize that women’s safety is not a joke?

EDIT: I cannot thank you all enough for the support. Thank you so much for validating my feelings and helping me see I wasn’t overreacting.

I posted on the NextDoor app about this, and immediately received a comment and message from a neighbor saying she recognized his description, she had a run in with him one block from where he accosted me and about 5 minutes after on the same night, and that she called the cops. She said he was wasted and threatening. She asked me to please file a report. So tomorrow, I will be calling the Police and making a report so that they can have information about my interaction as well.

Turns out he lives one block up from me which is… terrifying. Looks like I’ll be driving elsewhere and avoiding running in my neighborhood for a while.

"To the woman who made sure I was okay, even though I was perfectly fine. Thank you.","My dad and I were walking on the street. We were speaking Portuguese, we naturally speak loud but we were having a somewhat heated conversation about someone and we were probably louder than usual. I was late at night, so you might not have seen the whole scene properly, but you probably saw an older man talking to a younger women loudly in a language that you didn't understand that has a harsh sound to it. 

What made you react was probably the fact that my dad does this ""elbow"" thing when he's proving a point. He will take his elbow and ""hit"" me with it. It doesn't hurt me at all, but I was wearing high heels and lost a bit of my balance when he elbowed me since I wasn't expecting it. He apologized and caught me but you were there. 

You came in running from behind saying ""hello, excuse me."" We turned around and you looked at me straight in the eyes and told me ""You look identical to this girl I went to high school with from behind. I'm pretty sure it's you, do you remember me?"" I was a bit confused, and told her ""uh..."" Before I said more she said ""Maybe it wasn't you. I'm not sure it's dark, but she was a good friend and there is nothing I'd like more than to reconnect with her."" I smiled and said ""I don't think it's me."" She just said ""Okay, cool, well my name is Emilie, and I can leave you my phone number if ever you remember me."" As she gave me a big smile. It clicked in my head, this girl was just making sure I was okay. 

I smiled back and told her that I got it now, and thanked her. I told her that I was okay and that I was talking with my dad about something that upset both of us in Portuguese. We laughed it off and she mentioned how harsh Portuguese sounds and we went separate ways. My dad didn't understand what happened and thinks it's some girl thing. We resumed our discussion as soon as she left. 

So to that Emilie Montreal woman who made sure I was okay, you did everything right. If I was in a situation where I was being vulnerable, you gave me many ways out. You've inspired me. Thank you.

“I’m going to call you to make sure you didn’t give me a fake number.”,"I used to take a city bus to and from High School when I was 14-17 years old (about a 2-3 hour ride depending on the day) and looking back on it, the amount of grown MEN who tried talking to me, flirting with me or following me is disgusting. I was taught to be polite as “we don’t know what that person is going through,” and because it was so instilled into me, I was extremely non confrontational about literally everything including standing up for myself. Most days, I got home by sitting with my bag in the chair next to me, blaring music in my headphones and ignoring anyone who tried talking to me. Some of those days, I didn’t have the small protection of my music because my iPod had died. That is apparently a good enough reason to talk to a child who clearly looks underage and who is clearly alone. 


I’ve had adult men tell me, “You’re really pretty,” or “You would look better without that makeup on.” Ive had them ask me to “hang out” and to “come over and smoke with them.” I’ve been offered to buy fake prescription scripts and to “go into Taco Bell’s bathroom real quick.” I honestly prefer when they talk and leave it at that when I laugh it off but when I’m sitting waiting for the next transfer bus to arrive, that’s when I would get nervous. I remember being 15 and a guy ran across a main road to walk beside me, asking me personal questions, my name, where I was going, where my home is, why do I have to pick up my sister when we could hang out? Even as I continued to walk to my destination he still followed right along next to me like a sadistic lost puppy. When he asked for my number, I gave it to him knowing it was fake (I hadn’t learned to say no at this point and was stupid and young), and you can imagine the sinking feeling I had when he told me he was calling it right then to see if I was lying about the number or not. Well, when my phone didn’t ring, guess who now knew about my lie? And guess who got angry about it? He did. An adult male got angry over a 15 year old giving out a fake phone number to a random man that ran across a busy street to her. My only way of calming down the situation which, I shouldn’t have had to do, was to give him my real number and tell him I forgot I had switched numbers recently. After he called it and made sure I showed him my phone screen to make sure the call went through, that is when he left me. 


It took me awhile to understand it’s okay to not be polite to everyone especially if you are alone. I still would give real or fake numbers out to appease the people who surrounded me at the time. I was always scared what the wrong person would do if I said no so I started saying, “I don’t give my number to strangers, I’m sorry.” It took me too long to realize how fucked up it is that we have to deal with fear and paranoid thoughts about what could happen just from simply taking a bus ride home. 


To anyone who needs to hear this, especially teenagers, stand up for yourself. If you’re uncomfortable and alone, try to find someone that could help you. You don’t have to be polite; you don’t have to be compliant with someone you don’t know. This part is a recommendation, if you see someone clearly in a predicament they don’t want to be in, help in your own way but assess the situation first. Please be safe out there.


Edit: Since this gained more traction than I thought, people in the comments have been saying Google Voice is a good workaround instead of giving out your personal number. This wasn’t around when this happened to me, but I recommend using that or a fake number generator app! (Text Free)

Restraining order against a colleague’s wife. 6 months of hell,"Front Page Edit: while I have your attention, I would like to stress how hard this process has been and that I have had to be a fierce advocate for myself and my family’s safety. I have wanted to just walk away and forget about it so many times. If you are going through something similar, stick with the process and see it through. Leveraging the legal system to help protect you is not cowardly - it is courageous. Self-defense is always an option you can explore but no matter what it’s not your fault and you do not need to resort to violence in order to regain your safety. 

If you know someone is being harassed or abused or worse, believe them. Support them. Be a resource to them. Help them work through the legal process even when it’s completely overwhelming and seems futile. 

**Post hearing update:** The judge granted a one-year restraining order. Thank you for all of the support and for sharing your stories. Who knew an insomniac’s musings would create so much interest? I am glad that this phase is over and I am anxious to move on with my life.

Wall of text below. But I cannot sleep and this is a story I want to share with other women. Thank you in advance for reading. 

About six months ago, my colleague’s estranged wife assumed we were having an affair and started stalking me. It is worth noting that we work at a university and live in a fairly small community. We also never had an affair but we were friends before this all started. 

She was already stalking him and when she found my phone number in his call logs, she turned her attention to me. Over the course of several weeks, she followed me home from work, found out which gym I go to, called my boss, called my HR rep, created multiple burner numbers to text and call me, created accounts in her husbands name and contacted me, and continually threatened to show up at my office and cause a scene. 

During all this time, I respond to her three times. Once to say she was wrong and to stop contacting me, once to tell her i was filing a police report, and once to say I was filing a restraining order if she contacted me again. 

These past months I’ve been unable to answer unknown numbers, every white SUV is a threat, bumps in the night jolt me awake, and i live in constant fear that I’ll be assaulted in my office. 

It took two months to serve her as she kept hiding and i ended up having to hire someone to do it. When we finally went to court 6 weeks ago, she did not show but her written statement delivered by her lawyer claimed it was a case of mistaken identity and she thought I was her husband’s other lover. Then her lawyer accused me of sleeping with her husband during Q&amp;A. The judge postponed her decision but did grant me a temporary restraining order. 

Today is what I hope is the final court date. Where hopefully this entire thing can be settled and done and I can get on with my life and start feeling secure again. I have so much anxiety that I won’t be able to explain the impact this has had on me and that the judge will throw it out since there hasn’t been any violence. 

Thanks for reading and making me feel slightly less alone. 


Edit 2:  Hello to the team at work. Pretty sure I just doxed myself.

"A little bit upset with the ""lonely, sexless 20's man""","Increasingly, I keep seeing posts, discussions and conversations around the new epidemic of the single, lonely, virgin or sexless man in his 20s'. I see it online, I see it in real life, and I for sure see it on Reddit.

This discussion bothers and scares me a lot, especially with the rise of anti-women/LGBTQ laws, and increasingly 1950's traditional extremism that's popping up more and more. I'm a 20 year old woman and I feel like whenever the discussion on alienation in your 20's is brought up, it only applies to men. Women cannot be lonely; we all have a ton of friends of course!

But I'm constantly lonely. I didn't have a support network for most of my life, and all of my friends either are so busy with their own lives, or are fair-weather. It looks like I have 15 or more, but only 3 are close friends, and only 1 will drop everything to come and help if I need help.  I can go weeks without seeing any of my friends; but since I'm a girl, I'm not included in the discussion on alienation. There's alienation where you are by yourself, but what being in a group and realizing that you're only here as long as you play your correct part? I can stick around as long as I'm funny, but if I ask for help with something serious, then I'm a burden. In class, I can't for the life of me make any friends. I had no friends in public school, and I've only made friends outside of my classes in college.

The thing is, those experiences? It's not limited by my sex or gender at all. It's a very human problem, so why is half of the population excluded from talks about it?

&amp;#x200B;

Of course men face different limitations because of the ideas drilled into their heads at a young age, but the outcome is the same. Why don't we talk about women who struggle with being alone and on their own in their 20's?

&amp;#x200B;

And I think this applies to the sexless part. I'm just going to say the quiet part out loud since I'm so tired of people skirrting around it; the ""solution"" for these sexless young men is for women to have sex with them, and become their gfs, wives, fwb, etc, etc. It feels like a huge backlash against the fact that women are now becoming independent and aren't tied to their husbands by their hands and feet legally, socially, and financially. If we ignore the fact that not only men are facing issues in the most turbulent time of our lives, we can construct a narrative that this is a man exclusive epidemic. Also, why is there such a huge fixation for men to have sex? I don't see this for single, unmarried women for them to go and have sex as much as possible. Sex isn't that big of a deal to not have, and its a bit creepy and sad that men are told that they need to have sex or else they're not manly enough, or that it's a pressing biological urge. My own father said that for young men, it's just different than for women when it comes to sex. That they need it more than women do. Doesn't that sound so sad? Life is so wonderful and lovely, but men have to have sex for it matter? At that point, are they even better than breeding bulls? We're humans, not dumb animals. Why would we expect men to have to behave like that? And where does that put women? If sex for women is different than sex for men, why do we need to give men that? No one is entitled to someone else's body for anything.

And this need and drive for sex is ironically, part of the reason that there are so many sexless single men who don't a lot of friends. I don't have a lot of actual friends, but I've been friended just because the person wanted to fuck me. I've had friends try and get me drunk to have sex with them, I've had men who, we got along super well, but they started to get creepy because they didn't want a friend. They wanted to have sex with me. That's so horrid for both parties! I want to be friends with everyone, but if I have to worried that a dude is only getting close to me because of what I can give him, it's heartbreaking.

This whole discussion is leading to the idea that we need to return to traditional gender roles because men can't function socially or without a sexual partner. But that thinking limits men, and punishes women. In all of these talks, women aren't seen as actual people unlike the men are. I don't see anyone saying, hey, where are all of the lonely women? How are they doing? What's going on with that? I don't see anyone treat them more than sex and socialization dolls for men. And the conversation babies men! It acts like they are no more than dumb animals that need to get their dicks wet and that no one will ever ever like, so they need to lash out; instead of seeing them as actual people!  This whole epidemic of the ""single, sexless 20 year old men"" is just so dehumanizing to both groups. We should talk about men's mental health, but the solution we're coming to is that women aren't suffering and that they need to start fucking these poor guys and become trad wives.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Frustrated with the focus on men only in lonely and sexless conversations, and the unspoken idea that women having sex and becoming their S/O's is the only solution, and that women aren't suffering as people either.

EDIT: A lot more people than I thought have read this post, and things I skimped on in detail for personal reasons are becoming a hot topic which bothers me. I've struggled with making friends my whole life; I was bullied in pre-k for God's sake. I wasted a decade of my life alone in my bedroom, not talking to anyone and feeling cut off from society. I tried to make friends following advice from other people, because I know what real loneliness feels like. I got some DMS that didn't think that I did, but I do. I know what it's like to go out to school for 8 hours everyday where people hate you for things you can't change, where they hate you for being award or having mental issues, they hate you for being poor,  and the wear and tear it is it look at a room and know that if they're thinking of you, it's at your expense. I had to leave my first high school because I was being bullied so bad I would wake up vomiting before class. In my second high school, I started to break down mentally at the end. Every week as a senior in high school, I would break down and have to go home. No one cared. None of my teachers thought that there was an issue with me crying and sobbing in my classes so often, none of the new, tentative friends who hadn't been picking on my for their entire school lives cared that I was having mental breakdowns next to them.

I am more akin to a dude in my manners; I do get angry and mean when I'm unhappy. The same things that worked for my male classmates to get help didn't work for me. No one seemed to care that I was so close to losing it all. That's why this whole thing bothers me. There's an idea that women don't really suffer from being alone, that they don't need to contribute to the conversation when it's brought up. I am one of those women who didn't have friends, who everyone thought was ugly because my family couldn't afford decent clothing, and who was mean and jaded because I was treated so badly. When I came to college, I was still so fucking lonely. I did course work, made no friends in my major, and slept an average of 4 hours each night. Even when I started to get this big group of friends, it doesn't really cancel out the lifetime of being isolated, nor does it mean that everyone is close to me. A friend to me is someone who I can hang out with and talk to. Out of that big old group, only one person really gives a shit when I'm in trouble. I don't even ask other people for help because we're not those types of friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what it's like to literally have no one. I also know what it's like to have lots of people, but too know that if you don't play your part right, you'll be shamed and tossed out. Both are horrible in their ways; like how drowning and burning alive are. The whole point of this post was that this is an issue that is effecting everyone, but is only being applied to young men who don't have sex instead of the wide array of the population.

Men need to have their mental health taken seriously. I never said anywhere that all men deserve to suffer forever; in fact, I think the opposite! Wouldn't it be great if all men didn't have to operate underneath a system that treats them like animals that crave sex, but rather a system that treats them like smart people who can be wonderful, and amazing and alive. We can't make that system fair though in reality without also taking into account how women are treated though. Women are fighting all of the time for so many things - an issue that runs as deep as how society wants us to live together needs both sides not one. If we only care about how men are alone and sexless in an age where our lives are being torn apart, the path forward is one that hurts women and limits what men can be.

I know that this is Reddit and no one has any reading comprehension, but if you have beef with a point I make very, very early on, you might have the pleasant surprise of an answer that supports the point you want to argue about :D!

My creepy older male neighbor whom I've been avoiding reported me MISSING when he didn't see me for two days.,"UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xbwwpp/update\_my\_creepy\_older\_male\_neighbor\_whom\_ive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xbwwpp/update_my_creepy_older_male_neighbor_whom_ive/) (and below in comments). 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know how to feel about this, but hoping to get advice from women who can relate.

I'm mid twenties and moved into a quiet four unit apartment last May. Shortly after, the apartment opposite of me was rented out to an older gentleman who is retired, bold, and will trap you in a conversation. He made it clear that he did not like the tenants upstairs, and between his racist comments (neither parties are white, but are different races) and general untowardness, he did a great job at making them feel completely unwelcome in what had been their home for two years and the families quickly left. They claimed they were leaving because a different housing opportunity arose- I have no doubt he was a large, motivating factor. When they left, the only person left in the building were the neighbor and I.

He comes off friendly but in a clear ""I know you're too polite to say no"" way. Once he starts talking, he wont stop, despite any clear verbal or nonverbal attempts to leave. His door across from me is always open, and he is constantly in the front yard either talking to people or his dog quite loudly. I'm WFH, and least once a day, he knocks on my door, and if I don't answer he goes outside and rings my doorbell and knocks on my window, sometimes multiple times a day. I try my best not to answer and have to physically hide in my apartment to get him to stop.

I feel trapped in my own home. I typically don't leave, but when I do, he will either rush to his door to speak to me or already be outside, waiting. I feel like I'm being tracked. There are times that I leave or get home late in the night, and he is either standing in his window in the dark watching me, or rushes to the door to speak to me. I can't have guests over- He beats me to the door to great them. He's made several sexual comments to my mom (who's a good 30 years younger than him) and makes all my guests uncomfortable.

Several times he's mentioned details about the inside of my apartment that he should NOT know, which lead me to believe he'd been looking in my windows. That theory was proved when I actually did catch him SITTING IN A CHAIR facing my window- he was staring, watching me while I worked. I had to spend over $100 on privacy window coverings and now I never open my windows or blinds. And just icing to this cake, he likes to pay very loud music and talk loudly all day with his window, door, and our main apartment door open, so I can never escape him visually or audibly.

Last week, I was house sitting for a friend for two days. When I came home, he was outside and informs me that he had gotten worried and REPORTED ME MISSING to the property manager and the owner. He also stated that he thought it was ""that guy"" (my partner of three years) because he had shown up while I was gone and my neighbor wouldn't let him in the building. My partner has the codes and keys to the building and was stopping to feed my cats.

There is no way that my neighbor would know I was gone unless he looked in my windows repeatedly, since most of the day I work in the room farthest away from him and I already don't leave or open my curtains or windows.

I have already told the property manager that this man makes me uncomfortable, that I had caught him staring in my windows and am on the verge of feeling harassed. The property manager informed me that my neighbor is ""not all there"" and they placed him in this building because he felt the tenants ""wouldn't take advantage of him"". With him here, I doubt the upper units will be filled, since he's made it clear what people have waiting for them during tours.

On one hand, I don't know if I'm biased and reading too much into this situation. My family thinks he is lonely and just looking for conversation. On the surface he seems nice, and he has claimed several times that people attempt to get into our building for nefarious reasons that he's scared away, and I guess it's nice that someone would notice if I had gone missing. However, I feel creeped out, harassed, and fully uncomfortable. I'm stuck here for 8 months, most likely alone. I don't think I can set hard boundaries with him without drastic consequences to my quality of life.

"Sexist, insufferable boomer put his hands on my neck today.","I volunteer at a local animal shelter and there’s a very creepy old guy who volunteers there. Most other volunteers there are women who avoid him. I’m one of the only volunteers that speaks to him so he trusts me. (Keep your enemies close.) He has made a lot of wildly inappropriate comments to me, including calling another volunteer a bitch, and rude comments about a female staff’s body figure. He has even made comments to me about hating his wife who has Parkinson’s and is in hospice care. He’s asked me and my friend weird personal questions, like whether or not we are roommates, which felt so gross of him to ask, especially when it was followed by a question about my relationship status and then an inference about my sexual orientation.

Today, we were alone in the back and I was talking to him about something. I can’t remember what was said but it doesn’t matter because he made a face like he was angry and put his hands on my neck and pretended to choke me. Throughout the day, he made multiple comments about “women not being good listeners” and after hearing it several times I jokingly replied, “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that,” and he made this angry face and grabbed my hat off of my head.

The rest of the women there are totally passive and just avoid him or try to keep the conversations with him short. I’ve only volunteered for a few weeks but I’m ready to start collecting evidence and speak to other volunteers so I can file a report. He crossed a huge line today. The women who work there don’t deserve to feel uncomfortable, unsafe, harassed, or intimidated.

Reflecting back, I should have kicked him in the balls when he put his hands on my neck. If I ever have a daughter one day, she’s going to learn jiu-jitsu. If you have a daughter, niece, or a little sister, please consider enrolling her in self-defense and encourage her to fight instead of freeze if she is ever touched non-consensually. 

TL;DR Boomer who tests boundaries with women and makes sexist comments put his hands on my neck and pretended to choke me today. It is now my mission to get him banned from the shelter. Wish me luck.

I had a wholesome experience with a catcaller today,"I had something happen today which has never happened in my very long history of unwanted advances by groups of men when walking alone, it was so unexpected and wholesome that I felt like sharing.

I was walking on a busy street today when I was catcalled by two men passing me. This kind of thing usually happens at night when I’m by myself and already feeling unsafe, so I would usually ignore it and immediately walk in the direction of the nearest main road. But in broad daylight and with cars around, I felt confident enough to call him out and say ‘You shouldn’t say that to people, I think it’s rude’.

The catcaller of the two guys immediately escalated the situation, changing paths to approach me, raising his voice and asking ‘What, you don’t like a compliment? I’m not trying to pick you up or anything, I’m just telling you – ‘ etc.

I told him, ‘I don’t take it as a compliment, actually it makes me uncomfortable.’

The catcaller was still coming towards me and started to say something else, when the second guy stepped in and called him out, saying ‘She said she doesn’t like it, leave her alone’.

The catcaller turned back and started arguing with the second guy, who cuts him off, and apologises to me on his friend’s behalf, and they both leave.

It might seem like a little deal, but it meant the absolute world to me that a stranger would see a problem with his friend’s behaviour and call him out on it. In all my experiences of being catcalled by groups of men, I have never had a man intervene like this. 

Welp, that was my wholesome experience. Although I feel like I should add the disclaimer that I don't think it's any wom*n's job to teach men appropriate behaviour, especially in situations where doing so might put you at risk. This guy was much larger than me, and I was genuinely scared when he changed paths to come at me. Stay safe.

Edit: to the people who are confused or upset about my use of the term 'wom*n', I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I used this term to try to encompass all people whom identify as a woman and/or have lived experience as a woman, who have probably experienced feeling unsafe in similar circumstances. It's a term commonly used in circles in my area but it's been interesting to learn from this thread that it's not widely known.

To the woman at the gas station,"Thank you. It was 11:45 tonight, a Sunday, and the roads were pretty deserted. Me, being the procrastinator that I am, was on my last bit of gas and HAD to stop to make it home. I pulled into the nearest gas station and it was closed, but not a big deal as I had my debit card. I scanned the station and saw you pumping gas and immediately felt better as there was someone else with me at the empty and dimly lit station.

I got out, glanced around, being aware of my surroundings as my always paranoid mother taught me. We made eye contact and you gave me a comforting smile. I was typing in my pin number and noticed you closing your gas cap and getting into your vehicle. I didn't want you to leave. You were a stranger, you could have been a serial killer, but your smile and your eyes put me at ease. I felt safer with you around. 

You pulled away and went around the gas station and the minute you were out of sight, I was on alert. I kept checking my surroundings, wishing I hadn't picked the seeimingly slowest pump at this station. 

He came put of no where-- I was alone and then I wasn't. He wore camo pants and an oversized black hoodie, the hood up and shielding a lot of his face. I gripped my keys tightly in my hand, trying to get them between my fingers just in case. He asked for a ride, calling me ""sugar titties"" and winking. I quickly said, ""sorry, I have somewhere to be"" and wished I had sounded more confident as the words left my mouth. He persisted, yanking on the door handle of my passenger back door. I said ""no!"" again, this time, more forcefully. He kept laughing, like this was the most hilarious game in the world and tried my passenger door.

I froze. I'm not proud of myself. I should have jumped into the car and drove off. I should have had my cell phone in my hand instead of my car. I should have gotten gas that morning instead of the last minute. In everyday life, I'm typically a force to be reckoned with and strong and painfully independent. Why did I freeze? Why didn't I jump into action? Why did I act like a sitting duck instead of a ferocious lion? 

And then you came. You rolled up next to us in that boxy Element car that I used to complain about to anyone who would listen and you just rolled down your window, your phone in one hand, illuminating your face in the darkness. 

""I have 911 on the line. Take your chances or keep walking.""

He immediately put his hands up, shaking his head. A slew of curse words were said, including crazy bitch and he backed away. My eyes left him and moved to you. You simply nodded and drove away, not actually pulling out onto the street until you saw that I was safely in my car.

To the lady at the gas station,

Thank you. Thank you for being kind, for being strong, and for caring about a complete stranger that needed help. I can only hope that if I'm ever in such a situation again, I have the same strength and confidence you have.

I was married to a narcissist and didn’t realize it until I left him. Don’t make my mistakes.,"When I was a teenager I married my high school sweet heart. He was joining the military and had me convinced that if we didn’t get married I would never see him again. 

The red flags started when he told me he didn’t like friends A and B. We fought about them often, but they had been my best girlfriends since jr. high and I didn’t want to totally give them up.  “I’m just worried about who they hang out with , I’m worried about your safety, they’re not good friends they don’t want us to be together” he said. 

We moved several states away from our hometown and then things got progressively worse. I had my belly button pierced wanting to surprise him thinking it was sexy. “Why did you that? You didn’t ask me! You changed your body without talking to me first” I got confused and upset saying it was a surprise for him since he had said they were attractive, then he said “it’s ok hun, I forgive you, you just need to ask me first.” I felt ashamed that I didn’t realize that “I needed to ask him first” what a bad wife I was already I had thought. 

The first time he showed his true temper was when I folded the towels wrong. I had mixed in the blue towels with the white towels. He wanted them separate.  “I’m trying so damn hard to give you nice things! And you can’t see that!” He yelled, standing the doorway before storming off. “This looks terrible you can’t mix them!”  I cried, but brushed it off as he’s just stressed from work. 

He told me he didn’t want me to go to college in town like we had discussed before we got married. “I might get transferred you can’t go to school you need to be with me” he had said. I agreed. So I worked and saved money for school whenever that would be. 

He was happy I had made friends. But then he would become angry when I would go have girl time. “I just fucking miss you ok? I work so hard for you and I want to see you when I get home” He would yell at me. So I skipped seeing friends to avoid fights. 

I wanted to fly home to visit my parents for a few days. We were driving down the highway and it was brought up and he started screaming at me “Don’t you think I want to go see my family too?! And you’re leaving me here!” His face was beat red and he had pulled into an empty parking lot to yell more. This time I was so scared I didn’t say anything and just silently cried. 

We went to the beach with friends. When we left, he told me I was “too quiet today” and how dare I embarrass him in front of everyone. “Dan asked me why you were so quiet asked what’s wrong with you?!” He screamed at me as we were driving home, I cried, he pulled over at an ice cream shop and got me my favorite cone. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to make you cry. I just don’t want to you be moody around our friends. It’s embarrassing.” I hadn’t realized I was being quiet, I’ll have to try harder next time, I thought.

He would pick fights with me about the dishes or putting groceries away wrong, and I eventually didn’t have the strength to fight back. I would try to hide in the bathroom hoping he’d calm down, but he would follow me and pound on the door threatening to break it down. “The housing people will be pissed if I break this door down you’d better open it before that happens”

He convinced me to let go of my access to our bank account and let him handle everything. “It’s stressing you out just let me handle it” he said. From then on out I needed his log in and password to sign in, which he kept changing. Making me come to him with questions about our finances. 

It was so confusing because he would shower me with affection and grand gestures making me believe we were soul mates. But then he would yell at me for “doing something wrong.” 

I never spoke to anyone about it. I was afraid they wouldn’t believe me and I didn’t fully know how to explain it because he was so charming and everyone loved him. “I wasn’t being a good wife I must be doing something wrong” I would think. I didn’t know that his behavior wasn’t normal, I thought I was a bad wife and started to become massively depressed without fully understanding why. 

The tipping point was when we was screaming at me about wanting to go out with my friends. I was pressed into the couch holding back tears and I got up to walk away to lock myself in the bedroom. But he stepped in front of me and pushed me back into the living room. I left the house. I went for a walk. When I came back he apologized saying “I just love you so much. You need to spend your time with me ” 

I pushed to go back to college and demanded that he let me sign up. That’s when he admitted that he had spent the fifteen thousand dollars I had saved up working at shit fast food job before we got married. “You can’t go there’s no money but I swear I’ll earn it back.” He had lied to me for years about how much was in savings, making me think I had even more than before we had gotten married. 

We fought a lot. I suggested we go to counseling, he fell asleep during a session. He never really listened to what I was saying and would tell me my feelings were wrong and why he was right after we would leave the counselors office. Overtime, if I “did something wrong” he would yell at me about how his family thinks we should just divorce since I was being so difficult such a bad wife, but that he loved me too much to do that. 

I stayed with him for three years before I got the nerve to leave him and at that point I was absolutely terrified of him. He got an assignment over seas (not deployment, just an assignment) and I took the opportunity to leave him. I felt like a terrible person for leaving him while he was away, like a complete coward, but I was so scared he wouldn’t “let” me leave and scared he would make it physical. 

My new friends didn’t believe me when I tried to explain what had been happening, he was so funny and sweet after all. He spread rumors that I was partying and cheating on him and that destroyed all of my relationships with my friends and acquaintances. He got his friends to spread rumors about me so much so that at one point I had a total stranger ask me at my work if I was “that whore at (my job on base)that was screwing around on her husband”. And he even managed to tarnish my reputation in our very small hometown, cutting some already small ties. He refused to sign the divorce papers, keeping me trapped in limbo for almost an entire year. Pulling power grabs and making false promises. But once it was finalized I was so fucking relieved I didn’t care that I was basically alone and had almost no one. 

Not even my family fully believed me, “him? No he’s so nice, maybe you could have tried harder. I don’t believe he would yell at you for stuff like that.” 

So if you’re still reading, after this long long post, I just want to say please don’t repeat my mistakes. If you feel like something is off, do not brush it aside or continuously make excuses for someone’s bad behavior. If someone is showering you with affection then screaming at you or putting you down over small things, that’s not love. That’s not love at all that’s control and a power grab. It wasn’t until years later that I saw an episode of some show featuring a narcissist husband when I realized that’s what I had been experiencing and I just wish I had know about those types of twisted behaviors when I was that dumb kid back then, it might have saved me from a very dark period in my life.",TwoXChromosomes,10753,1563672053.0,484,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/cfthln/i_was_married_to_a_narcissist_and_didnt_realize/
Bears. ,"I get this is a trending thing. I get a lot of people are tired of it. I get that a lot of people are glad the conversation is happening. I get that a lot of people have a lot of feelings about it. As for me, I’m burning with rage.

A bear has never told me that it forgot I was a person.

I’ve never told a bear it harmed me, caused me mental and emotional pain and argued that it didn’t. 

A bear has never shown up at my apartment in the middle of the night and refused to leave “until it got to fuck me”.

A bear did not park 3 blocks away from a clinic and let me walk to and from in 90 degree weather because it did not want to be seen with me, even though if the bear had put me in that position. 

A bear has never required me to do it’s laundry, clean up after it, prepare it’s meals, organize it’s social calendar, make it’s doctor’s appointments, find it’s missing keys, cover it’s bills, plan it’s vacations, organize it’s budget, and then feel entitled to be inside my body while failing to remember my middle name. 

A bear has never forbid me from closing the bathroom door when I take a shower. 

A bear has never blocked me from leaving until I gave it a kiss.

A bear has never scolded me for being hungry after a 12 hour shift. 

A bear has never met me for a first date, and when I said I was not going to be physically intimate, pushed me against my car and pinched my inner arm hard enough to leave a black and blue bruise while shouting about what a stupid bitch I was. 

A bear has never messaged me out of the blue “K👁️LL YOURSELF SLU✝️” “Go f*ck a goat, wh*re” 

I do not have a collection of screenshots of lewd, unprompted, unwanted messages from a bear. 

A bear has never touched me while I was sleeping, in our shared bed, in our shared home, and become enraged with me when I said “Please stop.” It was not a bear that then insisted I sleep on the couch and ignored me for days.

A bear has never followed me to my car, memorized my car and schedule and left terrifying notes and gifts on it. 

A bear has never caused me humiliation, and certainly not intentionally because it could not handle being turned down for a relationship. 

A bear has never told me it loved me, then dismissed every feeling or need I had. 

I have never asked a bear if it could just treat me like it liked me, and responded with “you don’t deserve that.”

A bear is not the reason I fear relationships, and have mistrust in others. 

A bear has never shown up at my workplace, threatened to harm me, then returned and exposed itself to me and my underage staff.

A bear was not the one, who when I was young and experimented with alcohol, waited for me to pass out. It was not a bear that was a decade older than me, fresh from military duty, that used my mouth to pleasure himself while I was unconscious. It was not a bear’s hair I pulled out of my braces. 

A bear was not what caused me to spend my 31st birthday in court, because it saw me through a window and decided to return every day, making threats and throwing canned goods at me.

A bear has never choked me.

A bear has never shoved me, especially during a session with a photographer. 

A bear has never lied to me, has never allowed me to plan a birthday weekend for it, then immediately cheat on me with its ex after its surprise party.

A bear has never dismissed and argued when I tell it I do not get drunk with bears.

A bear has never accused me of being disloyal because another bear said hello to me. 

A bear was not the one that pulled a 🔫 on my best friend when he found out she was going to leave. 

When my best friend needs help going through family pictures, I am not there because I’m filtering out photos of a bear that harmed her. 

My aunt was not left in financial peril because a bear refused to pay child support, emptied the accounts, and left the country. 

A bear has never brought a 🔫 into schools. 

A bear was not the force that kept my grandmother from making her own financial choices until the 1970s.

A bear did not intentionally hit my car because the location tracker it wanted me to have was off by a street.

A bear has never said “Grab em by the 🐈”

A bear has never thrown anything at me.

A bear has never commented on my weight.

A bear has never denied me a raise that I had earned because another bear should be buying me dinner. 

I have never had to ask a bear to leave me alone, give me space, respect my boundaries, don’t grab my body, don’t text me, don’t try to drunkenly lift my skirt. 

A bear is not seeing this question be posed and get defensive.

A bear is not going to pressure me to be in a relationship when I keep saying no, and if I happened to meet a different kind, caring, respectful bear later on, the first bear probably wouldn’t start texting me about what a bitch I was rather than consider that being an adult bear who cannot drive, cannot pay his bills or do laundry, reeks of cat urine, gets blackout drunk and violent, lives in filth, and lacks emotional intelligence might be why I would rather talk to the other bear. 

A bear has never approached me in public and ask “Can I just sit and stare at you?”

If I should choose to legally join this bear “for better or worse”, I would not have to consider that statistically, my lifespan will be shorter and I will be unhappier than if I remained alone. While the opposite, statistically, for the bear would be the case. 

I’ve never had a bear intentionally do a task wrong so that I would just do it for them. 

A bear was not who chose to keep playing a video game when my friend fell down the stairs while carrying their newborn and then complained about being interrupted by her crying. 

It was not a 40 year old bear that snatched my 15 year old cousin off the sidewalk when she walked home. It was not a 40 year old bear that kept her in a tent in the woods across state lines when she was found.

A bear has never taken my jokes for their stand up comedy routine, then told me that women aren’t funny. 

A bear is not the reason my social media profiles are completely un-searchable.

A bear is not the reason I tell people to never share my contact information.

A bear was not the one that pushed my friend out of a moving vehicle because another bear liked her social media posts. 

A bear was not the one that put bruises on my employee. 

A bear was not the one that got my childhood friend out of being homeless, but instead hooked on hard drugs and tattooed his name on her face.

A bear never has cornered me on the street.

I could go on. I really could. It’s just never been a bear in my experience.

"Men with thin skin are dangerous: Ignored a guy at a stoplight. He reacted with threats, throwing unknown liquid on my car","Pulled up to a light. Had my radio on and the windows down. Chillin, just doing my own thing.

I'm a racially ambiguous-looking woman, in a very diverse city, so I've unfortunately been on the receiving end of what I call the ""Magic 8 Ball"" of multilingual street harassment of both the racial and seal varieties -- Everyday it's really a mixed bag whereby I get to both cringe AND amuse myself by deciphering both what language I am being street harassed in as well as whether the harassment is of a sexual or racist nature. Usually, a little bit of both, depending on neighborhood.

So this dude at the light starts off with his petty driveby street harassment through my passenger window. Not wanting to get into a confrontation or acknowledge him, I remain stoic -- I don't look over, I don't turn up my radio, I just pretend it's the wind. 

I realize this isn't a strategy that's working when he just gets louder. It became obvious he wasn't taking kindly to being ignored by a random woman at a stoplight. He just got louder AND ANGRY. He unloads a barrage of crazy and looks to be unbuckling his seat belt, presumably to exit the car for this perceived INSULT of not acknowledging this fucking douchewad. I see the driver side door crack open and a foot step out. Not good for me.
 
Changing tactics, I turn my head to stare this loser in the eye while I roll up my windows. I'm at the front of line at a left turn at a 5 point intersection. It's afternoon rush hour daylight. I figure, if I'm about to be attacked, I may as well be as visible as is humanly possible, because really, what are my other options? So I just start flashing my brights, honking my horn, and seeing a squad car a few cars deep in another direction, I just make a giant fucking scene. A GIANT FUCKING LOUD FLASHING SCENE.

Fucktart in lane 2 stepped back in his car, closes the door, and I see him pour something into a cup and he throws it at my car windshield. (Later, I find out its antifreeze). The light changed, so I sped off hoping to blend into traffic and I realize this dude has made an illegal turn to follow me. 

I see a bunch of LAPD vehicles swarming a curb ahead, pull up behind one of them, and just park. 

As racially ambiguous looking female, I realize immediately that fuck, this is very obviously the least worst move on my part. It's a terrible idea to pull up and stop a car behind an LAPD squad car while said officers are conducting whatever business they're doing, while not-obviously-white-looking. But it's also a preferable state of affairs than being chased down and likely assaulted by Fucktart From Lane 2 because its rush hour traffic in LA, and any attempts to evade this psycho will be cut short by being penned in by traffic, making me a sitting duck. I rolled down the window and yelled to one of the cops that some guy was chasing me by car, gave a description, and asked if I could just park my car near their cars for a minute until he moved on.

So that's what I did. And that was just fine, I went home after a few minutes. The cops were obvi, very busy and not going to give chase or take a report. The officer I spoke to gave the others a quick heads up as to why I was parked there and went about his business.

All of this happened because of some dude with thin skin felt ignored by someone with a vagina. Which is alarming, on so many levels. 

Some dude at a stoplight, some orange near-dude in a not-quite circular office... this shit needs to stop. Nobody is entitled to my attention. It shouldn't be that serious, until some thin skinned fool decides to make it a problem. Then it becomes everyone's problem. Which is sad and terrible.

EDIT:::: Last Comments from me about this whole post. https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6n8jjm/men_with_thin_skin_are_dangerous_ignored_a_guy_at/dk83g42/

I, generally, don't fear the police. Obviously, if I did, I wouldn't have parked a safe distance from several squad cars while waiting for the creeper to drive away and leave me alone. HOWEVER, once I parked, I realized these *particular* LAPD squad cars and officers were actively working on something a lot more serious. As such, it made a LOT of sense to be both self-aware, and mindful that this *same* LAPD has a long and storied history of shooting first, then asking questions later, and usually those shot are minorities. I wasn't hesitating to report the incident, and the cop I spoke to seemed understandably anxious and occupied, not at all what I'd describe as ""dismissive"". The squad cars' presence was due to something totally unrelated. Stop PM'ing me to claim I'm ""anti-cop"" or ""being a victim."" LA is a great city with a lot of amazing people. With that comes some exceptionally shitty people of all stripes. UGH RIP my inbox.

A primer for Nice Guys(TM). (Trigger warning: LOTS of bad language),"TL;DR: if you're not part of the solution, you **are** part of the problem.  Full stop.

This is for the men lurking in this sub - the ones looking for women to pounce on, the ones looking to start an argument, the ones genuinely here to try and break through the veil of toxic masculinity and misogyny drowning them.  Any men who want to read it.

One of the most common addenda I see on this sub - on any women-centric sub, and often on others - is something to the effect of ""Edit: okay, yes, not all men are doing the problem I'm complaining about.""  So many men come here in bad faith to argue, ""Well, **I'm** not like that, so your argument is invalid,"" or ""what are you talking about, I've never seen this happen,"" or any one of a hundred other bullshit arguments aimed specifically at invalidating what we're going through.

So, I'ma break it down for you.

When women bitch about men doing something awful, the reason they have a tendency to generalize... the reason so many of us become misandrists... is because enough men subject us to their bullshit to make it a **statistically likely outcome**.  If nine out of ten men hit on us and don't take no for an answer, we're going to assume that tenth one will as well - we simply can't afford to take the risk of giving them the benefit of the doubt.

\- If you're paying a woman a compliment, because you're expecting reciprocation?  That's not nice - that's manipulative.

\- If you're being a woman's friend in hopes that she'll ""notice you,"" or put out, or accept you as a lover?  You're not being her friend - you're deceiving her in the hopes of using her.

\- If you won't accept no for an answer when you shoot your shot?  You aren't looking for a partner - you're looking for a possession.

\- If you touch a woman without an invitation, and get butthurt when she has a problem with it?  She's not being rude - she's protecting herself.

\- If the fact that a person has a feminine gender role changes your perception of their worth, regardless of their other accomplishments?  You're a bigot.

\- If you're standing around keeping your mouth shut when someone catcalls us, or makes a rape joke, or fires off a sexist comment, or touches us inappropriately?  You're perpetuating the issue.

\- If we act like you're doing something creepy?  *It's because you're doing something that comes across as creepy.*

I cannot stress this enough, guys: ***romantic comedies LIED to you***.  We act horrified when you follow us, because it's **statistically probable** you're following us for malevolent reasons.  We get scared when you won't back the fuck off, because it's **statistically probable** it's going to escalate into something unpleasant, and highly possible it'll escalate into something potentially **lethal**.

And when it does, the odds are overwhelmingly high that - at best - we'll have to go through miles of shit just to hold you accountable, if we're lucky enough to get anyone to listen at all, if we're lucky enough not to be blamed for somehow instigating someone else's vile behavior, if we're lucky enough to survive.

If you want to prove you're one of those #notallmen?

\- Take no for an answer and walk the fuck away.

\- Give us our personal space.

\- Judge us on our accomplishments, not our fuckability.

\- If you're absolutely intent on barging into our day to compliment us, compliment us on clothing choice, or skill, or our makeup, or **something** we have control over.

\- Most importantly, call your fellow man out when he acts like a jackass.

Nice guys exist.  They're out there - I've met several.  But for every one genuinely good guy I meet, there are a dozen other casually misogynistic pigs who either don't understand why we have a problem with their behavior - or worse, they understand perfectly and don't care.

And for love of the gods, if you meet a woman whose default posture is ""you're a scumbag until proven otherwise,"" take a deep breath and think about **why** they're so fucking scared.  Because, gentlemen?  Too many of you are acting the fool for us to take the risk that you, specifically, are one of the good ones.

**Edit**: cleaned up the formatting and wording a bit.

**Second edit**: over half of the responses are from men, as predicted.  To add to the above list of misconceptions we apparently need to correct: if you're posting a response that doesn't contribute anything more to the conversation than ""Here's my opinion from a guy's perspective, which is a different take on what you're saying,"" *please just shut the fuck up and let the women's sub be a women's sub.*

\- We don't need to know all the ways you, personally, are complying with the list.

\- We don't need to know how much you disagree, or how wrong we are for thinking this way.

\- We don't need virtue signaling or a categorical list of mitigating circumstances that ""explain"" why men act like jackasses.

Just watch, learn, and move on with your lives, instead of giving us several paragraphs of virtue signaling, or trying to veil yet another #notallmen response in disingenuous ""support.""

**Third and** (apparently not) **final edit**: obligatory ""holy hell, this exploded, RIP inbox"" edit.  To my sisters: thanks for your support.  To my brothers adding their support as well: at least you're trying - now go out and make it a reality.  To the bad-faith arguments, misogynists, trolls, strawmen, and brigadiers: die mad, you salty bitches.  We're tired of your crap.

**Fourth edit**: So, DMs blew up, thread derailed by the crap I explicitly mentioned in the post, a tsunami of #notallmen bullshit in both public and private, etc.  This, I expected and braced for.

What I didn't expect was being reported to r/RedditCareResources as a suicide risk.  For reference, folks?  Yes, I'm salty about the subject matter listed above.  Yes, I'm probably more than a bit depressed.  No, I'm not going to self-harm because boys called me names on the internet.

"I watched the guy who just targeted me go after another girl, and this time I did something.","He stood the wrong way around in the crowded elevator and kept exhaling hard, and I kept seeing him looking over at me out of the corner of my eye. The vibe was that he was either angry or on drugs; as we exited the elevator he elbowed me out of the way -making significant physical contact - and kept looking back at me as we moved toward the platform. I'm a six-foot-tall woman with a confident stance, so it felt like he was looking for a fight. I avoided eye contact, made measured movements, and moved away from him first chance I could. I figured I'd seen the last of him as we boarded the tube, especially since I change lines in the middle of my commute.

But just as we pulled up to my destination a girl came moving all the way through the crowded carriage to get away from someone, and there he came following her. She was clearly distressed and the people around noticed something was off, but I was the only one there who would have recognized the guy.

As the doors opened I took her arm and told her to follow me, just with the intention to separate them and put her on the next train. Instead, he followed us off and kept moving into our personal space, not going away even after I stepped between them and told him to leave. That's when another older woman got involved and came along with us as we all went looking for staff to intervene, with him stumbling along behind us continuing to pursue his target. At this point it's clear he's on drugs - he clearly doesn't recognize me from earlier and isn't registering that other people are getting involved now.

We made it up to station staff (male) and informed them that the man who's still trying to get too close to us has been harassing women on the tube. It's finally at this point that he got spooked and ran off, through the barrier and disappearing out into the night. We weren't sure if it's because it was a uniform or a man who got through to him, but apparently three women saying 'no' wasn't enough to break through his haze.

I'm disappointed that the station staff wasn't able to detain him fast enough because now he's out there and probably picked another woman to go after, but I'm glad another woman was ballsy enough to join in and make us into an impromptu guard.

I've tried to help her, I've begged her to come to my door if she or her son needs anything, I've told her that I will fucking THROW DOWN to protect her, and I DON'T FUCKING BLAME HER FOR NOT TAKING ME UP ON THAT.

Of course she doesn't, because who can she really trust to protect her?

No one...fucking no one...

This is the fucking world. And I am so fucking angry...

Sorry for any typos, I am still crying, and am stupid and don't know how to post stuff to reddit.

Edit:
Called the line, going to bed...I don't know what I'm going to do to myself if those people show up and leave and I listen to her die through the fucking wall...

Edit 2:
Woke up not long ago, she triggered my cameras by walking right by all of my windows (I gave her explicit permission to come to my door/use my yard already, I'm glad she feels comfortable taking me up on that at least). I watched her pack up an SUV I didn't recognize and leave.
I hope she stays the fuck away from the guy next door, and keeps the kid away too. 
I feel much better about taking aggressive action against him too, making sure that the child never enters that home again if I can...

I haven't read any new comments yet, I REALLY don't post on reddit, and 200 comments is a bit overwhelming. I'm going to shower, get dressed, scope the house next door, buy an energy drink, and come back to this. I assume most of the comments are worried for this poor woman, and I thank you all so much for being concerned, she deserves to have someone give a shit about her wellbeing, I plan to talk to her and offer whatever help I can if she comes back.

Edit 3: 
Had a friend (u/QuietPersonality) read the comments for me and give me the gist/resource suggestions. My anxiety got the best of me in this whole online situation and I am prioritizing the actual situation. I have emailed my therapist and asked them for resources that I can give her if I see her again, and who to call to have something done about the neighbor that is still there/ to make sure that the child is safe.
Thank you all for your comments, I will read them when I am ready to, but I'm going to prioritize my infant neighbor's safety, then his mother, then my own because there is no way the man living there still doesn't know that I called the police, and he has been stomping around all day. 
I am also going to grab all of the security camera footage that I have of any of them in the event that it is needed.
I live in a pretty poor area, but I wear a utility belt instead of having a purse, and it is a pretty good deterrent, my father-in-law is also only 5 minutes away and would show up faster than the police if I'm home alone and feel unsafe.
I will provide updates if there are any.



EDIT 4:
She came back today.
I couldn't catch her, I was in the arms of a man that owned my dog for the first 10+ years of his life and is facing that dog dying (As am I, but I took him in knowing I was going to be his luxurious retirement home).
I made eye contact with her, she looked down and avoided further contact as she walked quickly into the house.

I had an abortion and my fiance is pressuring me for sex before I'm ready,"I'll try to make this short.
My fiance &amp; I live together,  been dating 3 years. We are both 30s ish. I have a job I love, but recently have decided id like to move on from. We live in a college town.  Abouta year and a half ago I made the decision to finish my BS in engineering (one more semester left).  My first semester back was hard, especially working 30 hours a week, but I was determined.  I take birth control pill form.  SO hates his job and decided to pursue a second BS. A month into my second semester of school I get preggo.  I'm so upset.  I have made changes in my life to make it better (go to school) and now this.  I tell fiance and that I don't want to keep it.  He is a little disappointed, but agrees we both aren't ready yet (this happened before we got engaged).  The nearest clinic is 1.5 hrs away.  I do the entire process by myself. He doesn't ride with me, he doesn't sit in the wai ting room with me.he doesn't pick up any Rxs. He doesn't even stay home the night I took the pills.  In fact, his friends came to the house when I had planned to take them.  
That whole situation completed and I am okay from it. However, I feel like I went through everything alone. He didn't even Google what I had to do.  He has no idea except the Information I give him.   They tell you not to have sex for so many weeks after.  After like 2 weeks, I'm still bleeding a crap ton and he's moping around the house because I won't have sex with him.  He's not saying it but I feel like he thinks I should at least blow him or something. I tell him it's health reasons and they say not to.   But honestly,  I'm irritated that he's even being this way.  After time goes by, we eventually have sex again.  I had started back in the pill, but didn't tell SO.  He doesn't even pull out. 
We never talked about why we ended up in this situation,  what we can do to avoid it again, if we should start using condoms with the pill, why I don't want to have a kid right now,  when we would both be okay with having kids,  etc. I feel completely disrespected in the fact that he hasn't tried to talk to me about any of this. Whenever he came inside me I said ""what the fuck!?"" And he's like ""oh, I'm sorry, do you want me to get you plan B?"" No,  MF, you take plan B! Do you even know how bad it sucks to take that stuff? Much less get an abortion? By myself??? 

Since all of this has happened I can't bring myself to have sex with him. I feel violated and that he doesn't even know it. He brings up that we don't have sex and he doesn't feel attractive. He makes it about him when it's about me.  I don't want to have sex with someone who can't consider someone else.   and then there's the fact of if I went through that alone, how would an actual pregnancy have gone? I want to tell everyone in the world the thoughts I'm having and why I'm angry but I don't want everyone to know my situation. We have sex like maybe a few times in a month.  He doesn't make me feel sexy because I immediately get anxiety about feeling preggo.  When he mentions it, I say, ""can you maybe think of the reason why I might be scared to do it?"" And he pretty much shuts up. So instead of talking and yes, arguing,  the conversion stops there. 

Enough time has gone by that I am ok with leaving the relationship. I want him to understand me and he doesn't.  Plain and simple.  He doesn't want to or can't idk.  I feel very trapped. I don't really have money to move right now,  although it probably won't take, me long to save.... this semester I had to work a lot less and focus on school, but it's almost over.  Any encouraging word would help, I feel like I know what I need to do I just need some help.",TwoXChromosomes,4589,1509896430.0,1266,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7ay88n/i_had_an_abortion_and_my_fiance_is_pressuring_me/
"Incel comes up to me at bus stop, asks if he's repulsive","So I'm chilling at the bus stop at a pretty busy station in my city. A compleeeetely average-looking guy in his early-mid twenties comes up to me and we have the following exchange. (The convo has been translated.)

Him: Hi, can I ask a question?

Me, thinking he wanted directions: Yeah, sure! :)

Him, with the resting bitch face of quiet anger: .......Do you think I'm ugly??

At this point I immediately knew. I didn't want to say ""no"" because I felt like this was shaping up to be a leading question. So I said nothing, I just kind of blinked like that blonde guy in that gif.

Him: Is there something wrong with me? Am I *so* repulsive??

At this point, a random homeless person enters the convo, asking for change. I suddenly felt really unsafe because the guy looked angry, suppressed anger but anger nonetheless. So I got up and started walking, leaving him with a very insistent homeless person.

I looked back to see if he was coming after me. He leaned to look over the homeless guy's shoulder and called after me sarcastically, ""Thanks...! Thanks a lot!""

This happened months ago. I just told my sister the story and to my surprise, she said the same thing happened to her at a different station, a more empty one and at 2AM to top it all off. She described a different guy than the one I met, meaning there's a network of incels in my city going up to women and opening with ""Do you think I'm ugly"".

Just wanted to share, I wonder if this is a thing in other places, too.

**Edit:**

I don't want to be crushing you guys' ideals but I don't think the homeless person was aware of what was going on, he seemed pretty damn out of it. I'm not saying this to say homeless people **can't** **ever** be aware of what's going on or they can't ever benevolently intervene, but it certainly didn't seem to be the case. There are a LOT of beggars in this area and this man happened to waddle over there, I'm not trying to spin this into a heartwarming story of a homeless savior because it simply wasn't, honestly. This was a story of a poor guy wanting change and an insecure guy probably thinking he had it worse than the homeless guy and a scared woman wondering what even to say and that was it.

Frankly, from looking at the homeless people in my area, I doubt that their first priority would be to intervene in such cases, they simply look too miserable to do so. They look like they're in pain, some of them act like they're high on either relaxants or stimulants. The person in question seemed high on relaxants to me (or he simply haven't had anything to eat, I don't know). From witnessing the entire scene I firmly believe he just wanted change. I don't want this to read like a feel-good story, it simply wasn't, unfortunately. Nobody came to save me OR the homeless guy. It was an all-around indecipherable exchange by three strangers, nothing came of it except for this post.

**Edit2:**

I deliberately Googled the title of this post to see if it has shown up on incel forums these past 12hrs. It has, although it's only gotten a couple comments, but they've been saying that I made this up. Well I haven't. Only I will know that forever, they can never know for sure.

I broke up with my abusive boyfriend three years ago and it still haunts me,"I started dating him senior year of college. I already had a job in a city 4 hours away. He didn't have a job yet but found one close to where I would be. We graduate, move there and get separate apartments about an hour away from each other. 

He doesn't like spending nights by himself, so we spend almost every night sleeping over at each other's apartments, but he doesn't like long commutes, so 90% of the time we stay at his place. I get an hour commute every morning, he gets a 15 minute commute. 

He likes to play video games, but I'm not really a fan. Too bad, we can't possibly do separate things, we love each other and should want to be together all the time. I spend most of my nights watching him play video games.

He demands we text each other all throughout the day. My work doesn't like me to be on my phone. I find a way to appease him by using an internet browser messaging service. I'm expected to answer him within 60 seconds. If I mess up, it's because I don't love him enough. I have to tell him when I'm leaving my desk so he doesn't ""get sad waiting for me to respond.""

If we don't ""connect"" well enough over the day, he will want to ""eat dinner alone."" Which means he will pick up fast food on the way home, and then spend the rest of the night completely ignoring me. But I'm still required to watch him play video games. I just have to do it in silence while he seethes at me from the other end of the couch. If I don't follow the normal night schedule, I am showing him how ""I don't care enough to make it up to him."" Except I don't understand what I did wrong and what I need to make up to him.

I learn to manage his emotions. I know what will set him off and how. I hide things from him. I went out to lunch with my coworkers today, but he had packed my lunch the night before? I make sure I throw out the reciept where he won't find it. I even dump the lunch he made me so I can bring home an empty container. But this doesn't work all the time, because when something happens that's out of my control, it's still my fault and I get punished. 

He breaks up with me at least one a week. He gets so angry that he ""just can't handle all the stress I put him through."" But I know he doesn't mean it. It's my job to talk him down. I apologize and tell him everything is my fault and I will fix it in the future. We do this so often, I start to believe it.

I call my friends crying a lot. Am I a bad person for doing [insert latest argument] to my boyfriend? They get tired of having the same conversations with me. ""Just break up with him."" But how could I? I stop calling them. I worry they are judging me. They think I'm weak or stupid for staying with him. They don't understand.

He starts getting resentful. He doesn't like the city that I picked. He doesn't like his job. He doesn't have any friends here. He nitpicks at my life to show me how I shouldn't like my job either. He constantly tells me that my friends ""just don't seem like my people"". I have to run any after-work events by him. He usually finds excuses for me not to go. ""But babe, we planned on going to the grocery store tonight. You can't make me do that by myself. Don't you love me?"" Don't I love him?

He starts suggesting we move. He reminisces about his hometown. It's so much nicer than this city. His parents would be so happy if he moved back. He has friends there. Our lives would be so much better there. I'm not sure. But ""I don't like my job so it shouldn't be hard for me to leave."" 

We both find jobs near his family. Mine starts in August, but he doesn't have a start date yet. He tells me to move up anyway. He will be up there soon. So I move up and start my job. He comes up every weekend. We spend time with his friends and his family. He is very happy.

Except now it's September and October and he still doesn't have a start date. He calls the company every week, but they are waiting on his background check. There is nothing he can do but wait. He does not take that well. It's my fault. Did I tell the company something that would delay his background check? I shouldn't have taken this job before he had a start date. It's my fault we are living 5 hours from each other. How could I do this to him? Didn't I love him?

He comes up to see me for Halloween. He walks in the door but doesn't say hi. He glares at me. I didn't call him on his drive up to see me? He was bored! How could I have left him to be so bored? He was putting time and energy into coming up to see me, but I couldn't even bother to call him while he was driving? Was I an idiot? How could I do that to him? Didn't I love him?

He told me we were over. This time, I don't play my defined role. I say ""ok."" He is livid. I am supposed to fight back, but I don't have the energy. He throws things on the floor and goes to his parents. 

I start packing. I'm going to drive 2 hours to my parents. I can't be here anymore. While I'm packing he comes back. He's talked with his parents about our fight and he is going to give me another chance. I still don't apologize. I tell him I'm really breaking up with him and I'm going to my parents house. He cracks. He alternates between yelling at me, throwing things, and sobbing on my shoulder. 

I tell him I want to leave, but he won't let me. I try to leave but he physically holds me back. He tells me ""I'm not allowed to leave until I understand."" I tell him I do understand and this is my decision. He responds if this is my decision, I obviously don't understand well enough. 

After and hour, I am finally allowed to leave. I drive to my parents house, I'm so emotionally and physically exhausted. They don't ask questions and just give me a hug. God bless them. 

I spend the next month living with my parents commuting to work 2 hours each way. I'm afraid to go back to my apartment because he has a key. He texts and calls me 100s of times in this period. I don't answer. I'm depressed. I feel like a shell of a person. 

I slowly make steps back to being a human. I go back to living in my apartment. I make a friend at work. I try dating. My friends from college visit me and help me back to my feet. Three years go by and to the outside observer, I'm all better.

But to this day I'm still terrified that I'll see him again. I still have nightmares about him. I still live in his hometown. I avoid his favorite bars. I worry I will see him at the grocery store. Writing this all down made me shake and cry. 

I'm not sure how to end this, but Halloween always brings me back to those dark times. I feel so lucky to have been able to leave that situation, but sometimes I feel like my mind is still there. 

Maybe someone will read this and see a little of themselves in it. To you, I say that you are not stupid. You are not weak. You are being manipulated and abused.

"American Sharia: Why women should never leave the house, and how we are being convinced of this by our own counterparts.","I listened to a podcast about a girl being murdered walking to her car after a shift, and now I’m afraid to go to work. 


I was cat-called on the street, and now I don’t want to go on walks anymore.


After reading all of those “man or bear” discussions, I don’t even want to go hiking alone anymore. It used to be my favorite hobby, but seeing all of those threads about how awful men can be, I’d rather just stay home.


I’ve been lifting weights for a while now and have been sparring at my MMA gym, I’ve been really successful, but I’ve heard that “men pretending to be women” are trying to join combat sports, and men are over 1000% stronger than women, even the strongest woman could never beat the lowest 99% of men, so I think I should just stop because it is pointless. 


I’m not afraid of men, but everyone tells me I should be or I’m not a girls-girl. 


I’m a really accomplished systems analyst, but I keep hearing that any job I get will result in me getting underestimated and undermined. Should I just go into accounting? 


At what point do we take a moment to consider the potential that the feminist ideology has been high-jacked by bad actors? At what point do we define the line between earnestly considering the experiences people have had and recognizing that there are people who gain a lot from scaring us into shrinking back into the homes? At what point do we remember the virtue of unabashed feminine strength and tenacity that once pervaded the ideology and has been replaced with a narrative of ambiguous victimhood with threats of alienation?

I can’t stand how men try to say they are just as afraid of being attacked as women are,"Every time a woman says, “I wish I could walk alone and not fear for my life” a man has to chime in and say “men are scared to do that, too.” 

They don’t understand that it’s literally incomparable. They say it’s irrational and ridiculous that we feel our hearts racing and think of an exit plan when we’re walking somewhere alone at night and a lone man is walking close to us. They say they’re also scared of being attacked or raped just like us, as if they walk back to their cars with keys between their knuckles or look underneath their car to see if someone is going to slice their achilles and kidnap them. I am always on edge when I’m alone, and I just know men are not. 

It makes me so mad that they think this is the same, that men are just as scared of other men as women are. I wish they knew what it felt like.

Edit to add: I’m not saying men can’t be scared to walk alone at night or that they are not likely to be victims of crime. However, anything a man is a scared of, a woman is scared of and then some. Men might be scared of being robbed, women are scared of being robbed and raped, etc. And let’s not forget catcalling and wondering how we’re going to react to it to best avoid being attacked, which men almost never face.

I've been hit with world shaking news and I need advice,"I've not been well for weeks, felt really bad.

Anyway, I felt atrocious this morning, too. I had a pregnancy test and thought ok, I'll do it, it's my last one anyway. I took Plan B about 5 weeks ago, maybe 6. I tested up to 27 days later and got all negatives. This morning, it came back 1-2 weeks. We think with how I'm feeling it's likely to be more 3-4 weeks. Please, don't tell me congratulations. I have never, ever wanted to be in this position, and I'll be going ahead with medical abortion - I don’t even know how this has happened. I'm petrified, I'm nauseous, I'm so worried I'm gonna end up throwing up - I have SEVERE emetophobia, I work from home and I rarely go out - I'm all over. I've done everything to avoid this for years - I'm 26 now - and I've finally slipped up with the pill.

Can anyone who's had a medical abortion before please give me some insight. I'm petrified. I've called a line and left my name, dob and number and I'm waiting to hear from them. Me and my boyfriend are also going to go to a walk in health clinic today.

I heard back and they’re asking me to wait until Thursday to talk to them, and then another appointment after which will likely be the following week. I don’t feel like I can do this. Mentally I’m not coping whatsoever and I’m freaking out. 




Edit:

I know I can’t reply to everyone but I just wanted to thank you all so, so, so much. I’m petrified - both the pregnancy, and the possibility of sickness. But, I don’t feel as alone or ashamed anymore. It’s hard to express.. I’m not ashamed, but I am, too. I’m sad I have to do this, but more upset I let this happen. But you have all been so kind to me, and it has helped so dearly.

My sweet boyfriend is upset, he also doesn’t want children but still feels emotional. He’s been there for me, and will be for the next few weeks to hold my hand through it all.

I have called for an emergency anti-emetics prescription and should hear from my doctor in the next hour or two. I’ve been cramping for days, but it’s been more prevalent today, maybe cause I’m anxious and I’ve just found out. I have a call tomorrow for my mental health (my emetophobia funnily enough) so I will see if I can rush through the appointment with the clinic, but it’s unlikely. For now, that’s scheduled for Thursday. It’s also likely we will look at trying another form of contraceptive like the injection so there’s no chance of me missing it as this isn’t something I want to have to do ever again, and I haven’t even gotten to the hard part.",TwoXChromosomes,1240,1755517244.0,142,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mtjluu/ive_been_hit_with_world_shaking_news_and_i_need/
Neighbors tried to label me a prostitute because I was sexually active,"I lived in Melbourne, Australia for a bout a year (2013 to 2014). There, I met a gorgeous same sex couple - Brian and Derek ( name changed ). They were both bisexual. They lived in the same building as me on the floor directly above mine. I soon entered into a sexual relationship with both of them. We would have threesomes, and sometimes gangbangs. Besides the awesome sex, I also became really good friends with them and we're still in touch. It was tons of fun for all involved.

Among my neighbors, were a middle aged couple with two children. They lived right across the hallway from me and were quick to judge us after seeing Brian and Derek exiting my apartment early in the morning on more than one occasion. The woman, Karen asked me in the elevator what I was doing with ""those two gays"". I politely told her it was none of her business. When she kept on pestering me, I told her ""If you must know, I'm friends with benefits with them, now leave me alone"". I still remember the look of shock on her face. I don't think she expected me to reply so brazenly.

When I told Brian and Derek about this, they shared their own experience in dealing with them. This couple was rather homophobic too and had tried to talk to the property manager about ""the fags moving into a building with families and children"". They were told to fuck off (just not in so many words), but anytime either, or both of these guys were in the elevator with them, or ran into them in the parking lot, the husband (Let's call him Todd) would stand between them and his kids while giving Brian and/or Derek angry looks. Must've been trying to prevent their kids form catching ""the gay"". LOL

In the weeks that followed, the entitled couple continued to give me the stink eye any time they saw me. I just smiled back at them sweetly, which pissed them off even more. On one occasion, their teenage daughter said ""good morning"" to me and tried to make small talk, before her mother dragged her away by the arm, while berating her for talking to ""that woman"". Interestingly, their kids seemed very well behaved and nice and I truly felt sorry for them.

My next door neighbors (another couple with kids with whom I got along very well) later told me that EM had tried to get them to file a noise complaint against me. According to EM's logic, since I shared a wall with that family, they could probably hear all the ""ungodly"" noises coming from my apartment and they should complain in order to protect their children. The nice couple told them they would do no such thing as I had never bothered them and they had never heard any such noises coming out of my apartment.

One night, Brian Derek and I decided to have a foursome that would involve the three of us and Brian and Derek's friend Dean. The next morning, Dean asked if he could come back to my place with me. As it was a Sunday morning and Dean was hotter than hell, I agreed. As he and I were walking down the hallway to my place, Karen was just getting out of hers. She saw Dean and I smiling and talking and his arm around my waist and approached me, asking angrily if I was being "" a whore and selling my body"". I told her she was insane and asked her to kindly fuck off.

Later that day, I received a call from the property manager. She wanted to let me know that Karen and Todd had complained that I was "" a prostitute"" and that it was dangerous for their children to be in the same building as me. They told her in great detail about how I was bringing home different men. The property manager had gotten to know Brian and Derek quite well and had and inkling that I was friends with them. So she contacted them and they told her all about the EP's crazy behavior and accusations and that the man they had seen me with was a mutual friend, there was no prostitution going on. The property manager dissuaded EP from filing any sort of false complaint against me as it could cause a world of trouble for them. I thanked that kind lady and later had a good chuckle over it all with Brian and Derek.

The blatant harassment from Karen and Todd had stopped, but of course, the hateful looks continued. On one occasion, when we were in the elevator together, Karen tried made a pathetic attempt at shaming me by condescendingly asking if I was going to have any men over that night. What she didn't realize is that shame about my promiscuity is something I'm entirely incapable of feeling. I proceeded to tell her in great detail about all the sex acts I was going to engage in that evening. I mean, she's the one who asked, right?

After this fun little interaction, she and her husband avoided me completely. Good times.",TwoXChromosomes,7296,1583661964.0,406,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ffamxq/neighbors_tried_to_label_me_a_prostitute_because/

Background, I've been seeing him since April. He made it official this week, but we were very much in love before we put labels on it, or so I thought. I had never met another human that I thought so highly of. Genuinely the perfect guy. 

I walked into a bar with my friend last night and I immediately had this horrible feeling that he was there with another girl. I can't explain it. When I got to the bar I turned round and there he was, across from another girl. I thought they were friends, but then he leaned across the table and kissed her very passionately. I just stared at him, and when he pulled away we made eye contact. He whispered something to her then he got up and walked out. I followed him out and very calmly asked him if I could get my shoes from his flat which I had left there that morning, I woke up in his bed yesterday morning. He didn't seem to be feeling an ounce of guilt, but the way he was talking made me feel like he thought I'd get over it. He said he'd been hanging out with that girl for 20 minutes. He got angry at me but I kept myself completely level headed. He walked away, and I was going to leave it, but I could tell he was lying to me. 

I walked to his apartment, waited on the street outside, and a few minutes later he appeared with the girl. I wasn't trying to ambush him or anything, I just wanted to ask him for my shoes, because the thought of going back for them in a few days was too much, I just wanted my favourite shoes back and then I wanted him out of my life for ever.

He blew up on me. He was so mean. I've never heard anyone be as mean to anyone as he was to me. Then he was horrible to my friend. Then he hit me on the back, pushed me, picked me up and threw me against a big wooden post. After a while of him screaming at me, I decided to drop it. He wasn't going to give me the shoes. I accepted it and walked away. 

While I was walking I called the police non emergency number to report the assault. And as I was hanging up, he came screaming after me. He brought my shoes, threw them onto the road, and walked away. My friend was a couple of streets down waiting for the police. She was with them when I got there, and I gave a statement. Now would be a good time to say - I ate two pizzas last night, and had one glass of wine and two vodka and lemonades over a space of five hours. I was not drunk, I don't even think I'd class myself as being tipsy. He was very drunk, slurring his words. I gave my statement, my friend gave one that matched exactly, the law here meant that they had all the evidence they needed to arrest him, but I also played them a recording of some of the things he said to me to show how cruel he was being. 

I was told that if I wanted them to arrest him then he'd be held in a cell until Monday or Tuesday, then taken to court. Don't ask me why, but I couldn't bring myself to have him arrested. The police went to his place to caution him and let him know that he was very close to being in a cell for a few days. He tried to call me, and sent some angry texts, and then I blocked his number and all social media. 

My friend and I had some drinks, I stayed with her, I cried a LOT. Today I got a text from him on the one app I forgot to block him on, saying that the police told him he could file a harassment charge against me. The thing is, the police were very much on my side and very understanding and sympathetic. At no point did I block him from moving, touch him, step onto his property. I stood on the street. I never once raised my voice or said anything mean to him. I don't know why he wouldn't have threatened me with harassment charges last night. It's all just making me think he thought of it himself this morning and is using it to threaten me. Does he have grounds to have me arrested? I have no idea. I don't think he does. I didn't do anything wrong as far as I'm aware. He also said something about me wasting police time, but I asked the officers I spoke to if that's what I was doing, because I decided against arresting him. They assured me I wasn't. 

The girl, by the way, I was being very friendly to her. It's not her fault. I asked how long she's known him, she told me two weeks. She lives a fair distance from the city this took place in, she was staying at his place last night. She had nowhere else to go. I offered to pay the ridiculous price for the taxi, she declined. She was trying to make him just get my shoes but he wouldn't listen to any of us. 

So now I'm here. Completely paralysed by shock. I feel so sick. I can't eat anything, my stomach won't hold it. I have no more tears left to cry, I feel so empty. I'm so fucking traumatised. Every single man I see, I panic and think it's him. I keep seeing guys that look like him and having panic attacks every time. I'm not really sure how to move past this. It's like a feeling that I'll never be ok again. I know that I will be, but I think it'll take a long time. I don't know what to do about my fear of men. 

I've been verbally abused before. I've been cheated on before. I've been physically abused before. I've never had someone do all three at the same time, and the fact that it came from someone I adored that much is crushing me. I'm very very lucky to have an incredible support system, my friends are truly the best. 

Now I need to get STD checks and a pregnancy test. I'm dreading that. 

And part of me wants to much to tell the police to arrest him, but another part of me doesn't want to ruin his life. That sounds crazy. 

I absolutely, 100%, would NEVER consider getting back with him, even if all he did was cheat, I would never, but the fact he was being so hateful towards me while trying to keep her... why her? Why not me? Why is he fighting for her and not me? I've been trying so hard to be perfect for him, be exactly what he wants, and I don't know why I'm not good enough. 

I don't really know what the purpose of this post is. I just needed to vent, and maybe hear from some other woman who may have experienced something similar. Sorry for the length.

Getting really tired of creepy men,"A couple days ago, I was in line to check out at the grocery store. It was 9am. The man behind me - looked to be in his mid30s - pet my hair. Like I was a dog or something. Just reached out and stroked my head. WTF. When I protested, he said my hair was “just so pretty”. I told the supervisor and he just made the guy go to a different checkout line and didn’t say anything.

Yesterday, I was at PetsMart. I’d just come out of the store with my cat food. It was dark outside and I was fumbling with my fob to unlock my door. A man came up behind me - SILENTLY- and put his face next to my ear and whispered loudly (idk how to describe it) asking if I needed help. I about had a heart attack. When I declined, he just stood there and watched me until I drove away. 

A few days ago, I attempted to buy something from OfferUp. I was going to meet the seller in a public spot (preferably the police station parking lot) and was trying to set something up when the seller started making sexual innuendos. I couldn’t decide if I was maybe reading too much into it or not so I kept trying…until he asked if I’d be willing to trade my used underwear for the item. BLOCK. WTF is wrong with them?

And the last but the worst - I volunteer at a children’s hospital twice a week on the oncology floor. Last week, I was there, hanging out with this one kid who is kinda my favorite. She and I have very similar interests and personalities, she’s basically a mini me and I love her so much. We were playing video games when the pastor/chaplain came in to her room - without knocking, which is also annoying. Instead of talking to the patient he started trying to chat me up. When I acted uninterested - only giving one word answers, not looking at him, etc - he then asks me for my phone number “to keep me updated on the activities at the hospital”. I declined, giving the excuse that I never give out my personal number. He doubles down and asks if I have a Snapchat or WhatsApp account. I just stared at him until he got uncomfortable. After he left, the first word the patient said was “Ew”. My thoughts exactly. Gross. And he was wearing a wedding ring. ETA: I reported the pastor to the hospital. 

Oh! And one more I forgot. I was out running errands. I was driving down a particular street, anyone who lives in my city knows that the right lane merges into the left at a certain point. Dude was in the right lane and needed to merge. I slowed down to let him in and he started yelling at me from behind his window and his face was turning red. He wouldn’t merge and we were holding up traffic so I just gave up and sped up, leaving him to merge in behind me. He followed me to the pharmacy and when I noticed, I immediately locked my doors and didn’t get out of the car. He walked up to my car, began screaming and yelling, and started pounding on my hood like a deranged gorilla on meth. He did this for FIVE minutes! I recorded the whole thing, including his car and license plate. It was terrifying. He finally stopped when a dude in the parking lot took notice and started yelling at him to stop. 

What is wrong with these men? Do they not have social skills anymore? Why do they think this kind of behavior is acceptable? I’d never purposefully touch a stranger, unless it was an emergency or something. I just don’t understand. Anyone else dealing with this bs?

"I just need to talk about my abortion, and I hope it helps someone.","I, my husband, and our two year old live in Japan. My husband is active duty and got stationed here about three years ago.

A couple weeks ago I was about 21 weeks along with our second child, and we went  in to have the anatomy scan. It was discovered then that our little girl had anencephaly, which means her brain never formed beyond the brainstem. It's a very rare condition and 100% fatal. The cruel trick that comes with it is that everything else is usually completely fine. The pregnancy was going very easily, she had a perfectly healthy heartbeat, and I occasionally got some strong kicks. But this is something that happens at about four weeks, which means that pretty much when we found out I was pregnant, we already lost her. She never had, and never could have had, any sense of feeling, smell, taste, sight, or hearing, or even the ability to swallow. I was little more than life support for her and within minutes or possibly hours from birth, she would die, without any sense of me or anything around her.

We were quickly taken up to the OB floor of the hospital to talk to a couple doctors about our options. I could stay pregnant and just let things run its course, possibly giving birth to a live baby or possibly not, or I could terminate the pregnancy. The choice was obvious to both of us right away that we wanted to terminate. Being in the military and overseas, my husband and his dependents (daughter and I) had only the option of Tricare for health insurance. Normally a wonderful thing because it's affordable and covers everything. But all they cover as far as abortions is in the case of rape, incest, or if the mother's life is in danger. After looking further into it I also saw that they won't cover any mental health needs after an abortion that they didn't cover. The very minimum amount of compassion. The doctors seemed used to and sympathetic to our situation and had information and resources ready for us. They were willing to help me have it done in a Japanese hospital, but out of pocket it would be about $8,000, and I was only two days away from their limit of 21 weeks. The other option was Planned Parenthood in California. They were very accommodating getting addresses, phone, and fax numbers.

It was Wednesday when this happened, and early the next morning (because of the time difference) my husband made me an appointment for the following Tuesday at Planned Parenthood. As you can imagine, last minute flights from Japan to the US are very expensive, so I went by myself. Luckily all my family is in California so I wasn't actually alone, but many times I imagined other women in my same position having to do all this on their own, as I'm sure many did.

I landed late Sunday and my appointment was early Tuesday. I thought there would be a lot of forms to fill out but there was just one paper, for a program called Presumptive Medical, which will temporarily insure children and pregnant women. Luckily(?) the military doesn't pay well so we were well under the limit for a family of three and the entire procedure was covered. My emotions were already at the tipping point and this news practically brought a tear to my eye. We already had blown through our savings buying my ticket, and paying for this procedure would be another two or three thousand dollars. 

Abortion in the second trimester is a two day process, and the first day is dilating the cervix. When I got in the room they asked a few questions about medical and family history, then I had blood drawn, then they gave me I think 400mg Ibuprofen and one antibiotic. The doctor was extremely kind and personable and showed me a picture of a uterus, how the procedure worked, and the risks. She asked if I understood, if I felt pressured, and if this is what I wanted.

It started out like a pap smear - I stripped from the waist down, had a blanket to cover me, and put my legs up in stirrups. She warned me that the speculum was smaller but I'd feel a lot more pressure. That part was actually pretty painful. Earlier after reading about the procedure I was kind of worried about the shot they'd give me to numb my cervix, but I barely felt it and might not have even noticed if I hadn't known it was coming. It also temporarily causes a weird feeling in your ears like you're under water. Then I started shaking uncontrollably, which seems like it would just be nerves although I felt really calm, so that made me think it was the numbing shot. Either way, it was impossible to control my legs especially with the position they were in. Other than that I wasn't having any issues. These little things that look like really small tampons had to be put in my cervix and she said sometimes they can only get about half of them in because for some women it gets to be too painful, so then they have to come back four hours later for the rest. I really didn't want to have to do that and luckily I didn't have to because up until the last four or five I didn't feel a thing. By the last few I started feeling some strong cramps and pressure. Getting all of them in is important though because it makes the next day easier and safer. When she was done she put in a little bit of cotton as well as some gauze coated in some liquid that was either anti-inflamatory or antibiotic, I can't remember, but it looked gross and bloody. 

After that it took me a few minutes to stop shaking, and I was feeling a lot of pressure and pretty dizzy. After a while I slowly stood up but then went right back to lying down again. The doctor went and got me Sprite and a granola bar, then she even went out of her way to have me lie back and put my legs up on her knee to help with my lightheadedness. I started slowly walking down the hallway but felt lightheaded again so they took me the rest of the way in a wheelchair. 

While making the appointment they said it would be better if I had a hotel room for that night so I could be close by. If I had any emergencies during the night I could easily get back and they could take care of me. It wasn't too long before I took the Ibuprofen and codeine they prescribed because I was getting some pretty bad cramps. It felt just like a really bad period. There was also a lot of pressure so it was hard to walk around, but they recommended not to walk anyway. I kept a heating pad on all night and that helped a lot. Luckily the medicine kicked in after a couple hours so then I got my appetite back, which I was hoping for because they said no eating or drinking after midnight. Despite everything, I slept quite a lot between about 2 or 3 pm and 6am the next morning, probably thanks to the medicine.

My second appointment was at 8am the next morning and they had given me two dissolvable tablets the day before and said to put them in my cheeks right away when I got there. These were going to help efface my cervix, basically starting labor. They tasted like chalk and took a really long time to dissolve, but after they did they made me feel cold and made me shake a lot, which is a common side effect. There were two other women in the waiting room with blankets, shivering like me. I was waiting a long time, three hours I think. During that time I broke down crying once or twice, and there was at least one other woman doing the same. I knew that Planned Parenthood has some long wait times, but part of it might also have been just the fact that they needed that medicine to kick in. It was in the last hour maybe that I started to feel some really light contractions.

Once they took me back I had to first strip down everything and put a hospital gown on. They had a container there for me with a blanket and hospital booties and for putting my clothes in. The nurse came in and saw my gown was on backwards and helped me fix it, she tried to maintain my privacy with a blanket but I really didn't care. I also had an IV put in and was given a small amount of clear liquid that looked just like water but tasted pretty much like straight lemon juice, and she said that was to neutralize my stomach acid, helping to make general anesthesia safer. Then she helped me get to the bathroom one last time since I wouldn't be getting a catheter (you only get knocked out about 20 minutes). I asked if the same doctor that did my procedure the day before would be doing the one today, since I liked her. She said no, and said ""But she's kind and very experienced and passionate and one of the most inspirational people I know"". 

After getting a few seconds alone in the bathroom I broke down crying again, and kept crying as I was lead down the hall to the final procedure. There were three people in there with scrubs and a much softer looking bed with supports for my knees to be up. I had no fears or regrets but I knew this was the end to the time with my baby that never had a chance.

They gently instructed me to open the back of my gown and lie back on the bed, and they helped my put my knees up. One of the nurses was wiping my tears and said, ""It's okay honey you'll go to sleep and not feel a thing"" and I said I wasn't worried about that. Then the doctor walked up and introduced herself and asked if I wanted to talk about what I was feeling. I said, ""It's a baby that we wanted but she has anencephaly."" My memory is fuzzy after that point but I think she expressed sympathy and asked whether I had other children and mentioned we could also try again in a couple months. I answered and the nurse dabbed my tears, then I mentioned my arm was burning. When I woke up I was in the recovery room feeling groggy. Once I woke a little more the tears started flowing again. The doctor was there and I asked if she had anencephaly, and she replied yes, and I asked if she passed away inside of me and she replied yes. I asked what would happen to her now and she said she'd be cremated. Then she asked if I wanted footprints and I said yes. A couple minutes later she came back with a really nice square envelope, with ""Baby (last name)"" written on it.

Once my tears were done I felt pretty much fine and with little discomfort. It did burn when I peed though, and upon further inspection the next day I think I did tear just the teeniest bit, which was probably due to the use of forceps. As sad as the whole situation was, I did feel a sense of relief to have it be over with. Physically I was feeling pretty good, with very little bleeding or cramping. Just like it said online, I felt almost back to normal after a day. Like one of my friends said, it's not the physical recovery that's tough after an abortion, it's the emotional recovery. But for my situation I was still recovering from the news we got on the day of the anatomy scan, from a week before. Starting from that point I already missed my baby, who we had planned on, and extended our time in Japan for, and named. But afterwards I missed my pregnancy, and my belly, and mourned the fact that despite my body doing everything right, the baby never had a chance. I was reminded of that again three days later when my milk came in too, although luckily not strongly.

I needed to get this out because I haven't been able to find stories like mine and hardly anything about second trimester abortions other than just some medical aspects. I hope my story helps someone, and to anyone who reads this please feel free to message me if you have questions or are going through the same thing.

Tl;Dr - 20+5 anatomy scan showed anencephaly for our little girl, a fatal condition. We are a military family overseas and Tricare has very little coverage for abortions. So I went to Planned Parenthood in California, where I was met with a lot of kindness, patience, and compassion. I came here to share my experience with abortion. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and sharing your experiences.

My husband was looking into starting some kind of charity to help people in a similar situation as us who find themselves with last minute travel expenses and possibly large medical bills. And I was thinking of how to directly bring about change and awareness. The only way seems to be contacting members of Congress, sharing my story, and calling for a change to the Hyde Amendment (the reason Tricare didn't cover me).

My abuser died on Monday and now I'm feeling all the things.,"Possible trigger: suicide and abuse

On Monday night I got a phone call that my ex had died. His Mom called to tell me he was dead, my first thought was OD, that was the most likely scenario, and then for a second I thought Covid, then she said he had hanged himself in the closet while she was gone. He had just got out of treatment, again, and had 21 days clean. He would have been 50 in July.

I escaped from him about 9 years ago. We have a child together, my kid knows nothing about him, not even his name. He's like Voldemort, no one names him. I still talk to his mom on a regular basis, I send school pictures every year and random snaps via text.

My first response was to be heartbroken, the guy that I knew, when he was sober, was amazing, he was charismatic, he could always make me laugh, he was my best friend, but he was also a fucking monster. The thought of him standing in that closet, alone, making that choice to end it is so fucking tragic to me, my heart hurts for the person I loved.

Now it's been a few days and I woke up feeling relief. I'm relieved my child will always be safe from him. I'm relived the insane phone calls and harassment will finally stop. I'm relieved that I can finally stop looking over my shoulder, he used to tell me all he ways he could kill me and get away with it.

He did me an amazing solid by removing himself from the equation. He wasn't a good person, he used and abused SO many people. He really had no remorse for the things he had done.

I went on his Mom's FB page today and there are so many posts about how much he was loved and basically what a Saint he was. People are releasing balloons in his honor, we met I was living in Maui and he lived there on and off for years so there are people doing a lei ceremony on surf boards. They obviously never knew the monster I lived with. No one ever believed it was all that bad, he was tricky like that. They didn't believe that he had really burned me with cigarettes, or stomped on my hand and broke my fingers, made me sleep outside for missing the bus home, none of it. 

Fortunately, he's not on the birth certificate, and my child has my last name. The day of the birth he showed up wasted on whisky and pulled me out of the bed and choked me out for not wanting to eat the sandwich he brought, he wasn't caught in the act, but the nurse knew something was up so she made him leave. He never carried his ID when he was wasted so he couldn't sign off. Small favors I guess.

When my child was 3 months old I got out of the shower and he was smoking heroin about 5 feet away from the baby in the bouncy chair thing, when I confronted him he hurt me in front of the baby. As I stood there crying I looked at the baby and realized I had a choice, the baby did not. I bided my time and hid money away and during his next bender I packed up whatever I could fit in my car and drove 1000 miles home to my family. That is the last time I ever saw him.

Still all these years people would think I was being ridiculous and over dramatic and would give him my number, so he'd call all the time and leave crazy messages. I just realized that's my life now so I dealt with it. His mom never did give him my info, she knew how awful he was when he was messed up, however he's still her baby boy, so it's all sorts of weird dynamics there.

It's been almost 10 years and I'm still dealing with the fallout of the abuse I lived through, he forever changed me as a person. I really do feel like a weight has been lifted. One I didn’t even realize I was carrying anymore. I'm fucking relived he's gone.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I just needed to somewhat anonymously get this all out. I'm not working right now, but my job offers free therapy options so I have a call into my HR department.

EDIT: 
I basically posted this as a shower thought that I needed to get out of my brain. I woke up and was overwhelmed by all the awards, comments, and upvotes. I have read all the comments, even the mean and shitty ones. It's been really helpful actually, all the kind words and reading that I am not alone in all of this.

To give a little more info since I've been asked, this is a little more backstory that also answers some of the repeated questions.

I suffer from severe Crohn's disease and a couple of other immune disorders so I was dependent on him for help with a lot of things. He def used that to this advantage. I honestly had no idea how bad he (and our relationship) really was until I was was completely out of the situation. I never thought I would be one of those people that lived in a DV situation. It made me realize it could really happen to anyone. It was like the old frog in the pot story. 

I never thought I was brave or strong for escaping like I did, it was just what I felt I needed/had to do for both of our safety and well being. I worked the entire time I was pregnant, he wouldn't work and his mom wouldn't send him anymore money, so I just did what I thought had to be done. (He was basically a grown PeterPan with a trust fund, his family has A LOT of money, like fly to Mexico just for dinner kind of money.) I don't want any money from them, it would be nice, but I feel like there would be way too many strings attached.

I literally worked until the day my child was born. I was a server, I worked the mid shift, I got off work at 4 and I checked into the hospital at 9. I had to go back to work at the 6 week mark, I didn't feel like I had any other choice. I had developed kidney stones during my pregnancy, they were so large that I had to have surgery to remove them, but they couldn't do the surgery since I was almost 8 months pregnant. They put a stint in and I went back to work. They induced me a month early because I was in so much pain all the time.

After I went back to work, I was trying to make it all work, but it was just too much. I was hospitalized a handful of times between the birth and the time I finally left. By the time I got home I only weighed 85 lbs. I looked like a walking skeleton.

Due to the Crohn's disease and other issues I was getting a lot of pain medication, it was a lot easier to obtain in those days, so I started self medicating with opioids and xanax. It got really bad. Fortunately, I have a very supportive family who was there for me through all of this. I no longer abuse medication, I am awake and present for my life, for both the good and bad.

I was able to pull it together for myself and my kid, it was really hard and a lot of struggling  to get where I am today. I got myself into counseling, went back to school and finished a degree and started another one. I was single until my child was about 4, I met someone who is now my fiancé, I have a job that I love, we just bought a home together in February. If you told me 10 years ago I'd be doing what I'm doing now I would not have believed you.

My son is happy and well adjusted, I've told him age appropriate things throughout the years when he's asked. For all intents and purposes he has a Dad, who he calls Dad, and a lot of other great male influences in his life, my Dad, my Step-dad, and a couple of really great Uncles. I've never lied to him when he's asked about his Dad, and I will tell him about things in time. I don't feel like he needs to know right now. He's almost 10 for those who asked his age.

Again, thank you for all of your words and stories, it's been unbelievably helpful throughout the day. I'm still working through a lot in my brain.",TwoXChromosomes,11866,1587677388.0,274,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/g6vdi5/my_abuser_died_on_monday_and_now_im_feeling_all/
"They didn’t believe us because he was a nice looking,nerdy, professional white guy","Trigger warning- stalking,violence,lewd sexual behavior  and rape ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ 


February 2019 a new neighbor moved into my quiet and mainly peaceful building. James is a nice looking, nerdy, professional white guy in his early thirties. He was polite (in the beginning),has a good job and looked like a good guy. But he started to target me (27f) and Claire (30f) my neighbor. It started small with him being overly familiar and excessively friendly,to invasive small talk while waiting for the elevator,asking if I had a boyfriend, if Id share a drink with him, or if the guy that visited me was my boyfriend(then later started saying it was my baby-daddy/sugar-daddy, it was my dad and I have zero kids. He was just being racist). 

At first I kept it polite but short. Then he asked me out. I let him down gently. Told him I wasn’t dating right now. Then he started saying we should be friends and invited me to parties at his. I gave him all the excuses, oh I’m working/got plans/got a headache/tired etc. Then one day he cussed me out for being a tease(I swear to all that is good I never once was interested in this man and never was anything but neighborly to him). 

Then I found out he was doing the same(not exactly the same cause I got a nice side dish of racism with my abuse) to our neighbor Claire who lives right next to me, who was also keeping it polite with him. After awhile he must’ve realized neither of us could be persuaded to go out with him. 

He then became angry. He started slamming the doors behind him if he saw either of us approaching. He would mutter stuck up bitch or n-slur in my case. My doormat was always mysteriously wet/white-ish stuff on my door handle. Random dms calling me the n-slur/talking about the good old days/degrading racist porn being sent from blank accounts. To packages going missing. Then one day he just touched his genitals in front of me. He just put his hand down his pants and started to rub himself. Then he started to watch porn on his phone really loudly when he was near me or stood really close to me in the elevator.

After months of this disgusting behavior. Claire and I started to complain heavily to building management of every instance of lewd behavior since the super/resident manager wasn’t of much help with our initial complaints. And these motherfuckers decided to tell him that we were the ones that had made the complaints in their meeting with him. Well that upset him alright! James’s erratic behavor became more targeted, more frequent and much scarier. It was near constant harassment and lewd behavior. He accosted me and Claire at every chance he got. He was escalating and it all started with just looking at us dirty,getting too close,muttering swear words and then it turned to sexual harassment (making sex noises, aggressively touching himself every time he saw either of us, whipping his dick out,rubbing against us), getting in our faces, breathing down our neck in the elevator just an increase of belligerent behavor.

Then a few weeks ago he threatened to sexually assault me “and see if that wouldn’t loosen the stick stuck up my ass”. I knew in my soul and without a doubt that this man was going to try to hurt me. I left and went to stay with my parents. I called Claire and told her to leave as this man is out of control. She refused to leave as this was her home. Last Saturday I returned home because I was tired of staying at my parents and had hoped he had cooled down. I spoke to Claire and she told me he hadn’t bothered her in awhile. At around 6pm I decided to get some food. I returned,parked my car and started walking towards the elevators,he then chased me in our underground parking lot(I didn’t see him chase me but I heard heavy foot steps running towards me so I just ran, instinctively) As soon as the elevator doors closed I called the police and they came out a few minutes later. This was maybe the 5th time I called the police on him in the last 2 months.

They told me they couldn’t do anything since I never saw his face and that gut instinct wouldn’t be enough to accuse someone of a crime. Okay fair. They even seemed frustrated with me as if I was bothering them. I begged them to at least check with the super for any security footage. Conveniently the camera was awaiting repair’s (its been awaiting repairs for almost a year now). The police left at around 7:30/7:40pm after advising building management to deal with him since this wasn’t the first time I or Claire had reported this man for harassment and intimidation. At around midnight Claire returned from work. James was awake, he somehow snuck behind her and pushed her in as she was opening her door. He beat her and raped her. He then fell asleep. She somehow found the courage and strength to get up and sneaked herself out. She banged my door several times as it was around 5:20am and I was asleep, I was scared at first and thought it was him but when I looked through the peephole. I noticed it was a completely naked Claire and I let her in. She was really hurt. It was brutally painful just looking at her. We called the police and when they arrived he was still asleep. They arrested him. Claire was taken to the hospital and I went with her. While I was in the waiting room I had the worst panic attack of my life and had to be sedated. (I was raped when I was 22 and suffer from ptsd ever since, so it was a traumatizing night and I hadn’t slept much the night before as I was completely wired up and anxious from him chasing me earlier )  

All of this could’ve been avoided if the police, building management/property company took us seriously.

INFO- using fake names and obviously Claire and I have already moved out. Claire is staying at her grandparents and I am now living at my parents.

Also I have a security camera that has recorded most of his behavior. I have written evidence of me contacting the building manager and escalating things to the management company. Emails sent to the property company that owns the building. I have recordings of James verbally abusing me,groping me,threatening me and I have recordings of my conversations with the police and building manager of every incident and they were aware I was recording them. I have video evidence of him pissing on my front door. A recording of hem smearing sperm on my door/door handle and on Claire’s door. Claire has the same recording as she also has a front door camera. From the moment we knew he was out of control we started documenting everything.",TwoXChromosomes,6393,1639072305.0,261,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/rcn11e/they_didnt_believe_us_because_he_was_a_nice/
"People are just so mean to ugly women. Please be kinder, Reddit","Warning: wall of text ahead

I am an ugly woman. Objectively, I really am. Please don't argue with me on this one, Reddit. I am not overweight, actually in better shape than most women my age, I dress well, I am great with makeup.

But last weekend the world just had to remind me that despite all this, people will go out of their way to kick me.

I don't often go clubbing, but Saturday night was a special occasion. A friend was celebrating her 21st, and it was also the weekend after a long week of brutal exams. It felt like a good time to blow off some steam. Because I don't often go clubbing, I really tried this night to look nice. There was an outfit that I had bought a long time ago, but that I'd never worn because it was a little sexier than what I usually wear. A close friend had picked it out for me when we were shopping, and, in that ""you go girl"" kind of way had urged me to buy it. I did my makeup painstakingly, straightened my hair which always takes forever because my hair is huge, put on that too-sexy-for-me outfit. 

And when I looked in the mirror I was even surprised at myself. ""Wow, is that me? I actually look...nice!""

I showed my friends. They all said I looked great. And they MEANT it too. Like, genuine happy encouragement. I could tell they were sincere and it made me feel so good, like for once I wasn't just masquerading as an attractive girl with fancy makeup and clothes, but that I WAS the attractive girl. I hadn't felt so attractive in ages, Reddit.

When we got to the club, we got a nasty surprise. We had been told that tonight there was no cover charge for girls, and so none of us had brought much cash on our person. Well, our info was wrong. They did indeed ask for a cover. Only one of us 6 girls had cash, and she only had enough to cover two people. When we got to the door and found this out, a group of guys behind us volunteered to help us out. They each forked over a couple of bucks to cover my friends, but not one of them offered to cover me. One by one my friends were let in and they waited on the other side of the door until everyone got through. There was an ATM machine nearby and at this point I was wishing I could just slip away and get the cash from there, but I was holding up the line, my friends weren't about to enter without me, and it was rather chilly and no one waiting in line was getting any happier. The guys were doing everything to avoid eye contact with me. They were looking at the ground, the street, pretending to look through their wallets for cash to cover one more girl. It was so painfully obvious that I felt like just going home. Luckily, my friend with the extra cash covered me so I was allowed in.

Well, once we were inside I thought I could just forget about that incident. I had dressed up and come out, to have a good time and relax.  So for a while I danced with my friends. It wasn't long before other guys started dancing with us. We kind of paired off slowly, there was a guy whose two buddies had started dancing with other girls and he was left alone. At that point I too had lost track of my friends and was alone. He started dancing with me, but the whole time he seemed really distracted. Not once did he really look at my face, he was kinda looking around the club the whole time, like he was browsing the scene for another, more attractive girl he could bounce to. In less than 10 minutes, he had seen one. He peaced out without a word, and I saw him dancing a few minutes later with a very attractive brunette. The way he acted with her was just SO different than when he had danced with me. He was face to face with her, smiling, dancing enthusiastically.

That made my stomach drop. I went to the bar, found one of my friends who was sitting there with a guy. She introduced us, he bought everyone drinks. After a while I felt like a bit of a third wheel so I went back to the dance floor.

Eventually my group of girls regathered together. Everyone had a guy, except for one of them who had a bf at home. So I danced with her, with our friends and their guys near us. 

There was a photographer going around the club, taking pictures of the people there. I assume it was for some promo for their website or something. He got to our group, and literally circled us several times, taking several pics from different angles. I was kind of psyched about this, so I did my best to look like I was having a good time, made sure he could snap me at my best. But after a while I realized he wasn't circling us to get our best angles. He was trying to get a frame without ME. If I moved closer to the center of the group, for instance, he would tilt his camera a little the other way. I couldn't believe it until finally, he actually came up to me and asked me to get out of the shot.

I felt so ugly right then. For all the effort I had put into looking and feeling good that night, it seemed like it just didn't matter. So the night ends with me leaving the club. My friend with the bf at home who was dancing with me left with me so I wouldn't be alone. The rest of my girl friends didn't notice what had happened with the photographer, so when they asked me where I was going I just told them I was tired and wanted to go home. And since I wasn't leaving alone, they let me.

So yeah, that's my story from the weekend.

Please be kinder to ugly people, Reddit. Maybe one of the people I met that night will read this post and recognize themselves. I hope so, if only so they can know how behavior they're barely conscious of can affect someone else.

EDIT: I have always been a lurker on Reddit so I'm not sure if I can find out who gave me gold. But thank you, stranger! I will enjoy this gold while it lasts. :)

EDIT2: A number of people have asked for a picture of me to judge for themselves if I really am as unattractive as this post suggests. I know you all mean well but my looks are a bit of a sore point right now so I will not be sharing any photos on Reddit. I was able to post this story because of my relative anonymity here on a massive internet forum under a throwaway account. I do not want to give up this anonymity.

A waitress was concerned for my safety,"This happened a few months back but I really felt like I should share it. I was driving to a friend's house who lives 40 minutes away from me and on the way my friend asked me to pick up to go food from Sonny's BBQ. Around 8:30 at night, I pulled over at the exit on the highway, and went inside and order togo food. I sat there quietly for a few moments and then a very drunk man came into the restraunt. He was a very loud, had extremely bad language, and took notice that I was sitting by myself.  He began talking at me and asked where my boyfriend was, why was I sitting alone, and implied that he wasn't seeing anyone either. I was very nervous: I was basically in the middle of no where, at night, and my friend was still a good 10 miles away. He kept trying to sit closer and closer, getting more and more frustrated that I wasn't answering.  20 minutes of this harassment continued until the waitress arrived with the togo food. She did not just have my food, but the man's as well. Just as we both picked up our food, the waitress says, "" You know what, I forgot something for your order,  just wait a second."" I sat back down and the man also waited. 5 minutes went by and the man finally says his goodbyes and leaves. As soon as he walked out, the waitress comes to me and says, "" I really didn't forget anything in your order, I just didn't want you to walk out at the same time with that creep. I think he is still in the parking lot, so let me walk you to your car."" Out we both went, into the parking lot. I got in my car, thanked her profusely, locked the doors and watched her walk into the restraunt. The next day I called her manager and the regional manager and told them what had happend and how greatful I was to her. I was so impressed on how above and beyond this waitress went for my saftey. She recongized an uncomfortable situation and took action to make sure I was safe. I guess it's just nice to know that good Samaritans are looking out for you, even at a Sonny's BBQ.",TwoXChromosomes,8101,1469068176.0,560,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4tuske/a_waitress_was_concerned_for_my_safety/
A rant about existing outside at night,"I’m in a new city for a few weeks, and have been exploring with my traveling companions. One is a male, and one is a female. 

For the most part I have been walking around with the female (I’m also female) and we have been getting (creepy) unsolicited comments from several groups of men at all times of day. These range from ‘You’re looking sweet, do you need a boyfriend,’ to ‘Have you ever had an Englishman, I’ll take care of you,’ and ranged all over the place in between. 

Yesterday I called my boyfriend and was venting to him that I felt like I couldn’t enjoy things about the city that I wanted to because I felt so uncomfortable and didn’t want to go out by myself after dark. He felt/ feels that I’m overreacting and just projecting because I haven’t been to this city before. He said that he gets approached when abroad often, too, and that these men are probably just being friendly. 

Last night I went out with the male in my group and we walked through all of the same parts of the neighborhood that I had been through with my female companion, and the tone was completely different. This was after midnight, and if we were acknowledged at all by a group they were friendly and asking how our night was going, joking with him about if I’m keeping him ‘in line’ or not, and etc. 

I’m so frustrated because I literally would not be able to explain to my male friend (or my boyfriend for that matter) about how much different their daily experience is than mine.

Leaving the house after 10PM alone isn’t even an option for me until I go home, and he can leave, drink, be careless, and not even have to deal with being uncomfortable, let alone being unsafe. 

Edit: To all of the men asking how they can help women feel more comfortable: you are probably not the problem, for me at least. 

If you happen to be yelling at women while they are walking in the streets, please stop doing that. It’s not flattering. If you start to follow someone after yelling at them to continue yelling FOR
THE LOVE OF GOD STOP. 

I appreciate all of the men who have asked and are trying to understand what women feel like and how to make it better. ",TwoXChromosomes,3769,1524924598.0,847,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8fk3rf/a_rant_about_existing_outside_at_night/
I found this on tumblr and i just think all women need to see this(about public harassment),"http://imgur.com/4TUpHBN

more than that : if you see a girl being harassed, she won’t always have that reflex. So YOU go and tell her : “Hiiii (insert random name here) I didn’t see you ! what are you doing here ? So glad to see you, come sit with me”. I promise you the girl won’t think twice before going with you.

I was with friends in a late night tramway once, everyone was drunk and tired, and there was a girl all alone in the seat facing ours. She minded her own business, finishing the sauce of an empty french fries carton. Two drunk guys show up and sit on each side of her, telling her that she shouldn’t eat that, that she will get fat, that it would be a shame to let such a pretty body go fat, and a various number of disgusting things. So I said “hey Julie, why are you letting those douchebags annoy you, come back, sit with us.” She looked at me and immediately changed sides to sit with us. The guys were surprised, saying “she’s your friend ?!” and I just replied “yes, and you’re annoying her right now.” I stayed with her until she got out of the tramway safe.

When you’re being harassed it’s sometimes very hard to think straight and find a quick way to react, so I encourage everybody to do this if you see another woman being harassed. Pretend you know her, and that she’s your friend. Let her know you’re here to side with her and protect her.

The guy Ive been seeing just revealed his true colours and I don't know how to react,"Hey everyone, Im actually struggling to have the words to describe how Im feeling rn, but I need advice, please.

Basically, I (21F) have been seeing this guy for a few weeks and everything was going great. He was the kindest, sweetest person, always asking me if Im okay, always being sure I was enjoying being with him. And that is the reason why I was so into the guy, I thought he truly was the best.

Yesterday, he asked me (all of a sudden) if I was only with him or sleeping around and I told him that I don't sleep around, I need a connection with a person, but that he could do wtv he was comfortable with. Im aware that he is in a moment of finding himself and so, even though I obviously don't want him to be with other girls, Im aware we have a very recent thing. He didnt like my answer though and texted me saying that the fact I wasn't sleeping with other guys made him uncomfortable and pressured him and he basically ended wtv we had going on. This happened at 5 pm.

Today, I woke up with 450 messages/call in all my social media from that guy, because he decided to get drunk and come to my street (thankfully he doesn't know my house number, as he has never been here) and harass me until I met him. The problem is that was fucking 4 am and so I was asleep with my phone on silence mode. The messages were very creepy and said things like ""how do you know you love me?"" and ""i need you in my life forever"", which scared the shit out of me because 1. i never said i loved him and 2. that is creepy guy material.

When I woke up, I asked him ""wtf"" and told him that I don't need a walking red flag in my life. He apologized and said he was very drunk and that he needed to think about his life before talking to me. Im so sad, because yesterday morning we were in a perfect place, i was so happy and thought I was so lucky. And now, even though I like him a lot, Im scared and feel very uncomfortable. I just wish I could erase the last 24h of my life.

**EDIT**:

 I just arrived home after taking the day for myself and Im overwhelmed with the amount of support you guys are giving me, thank you so much! I cant answer all the comments, but he is 21 years old (as I am). Also, he just sent me a funny tik tok like nothing had happened and Im even more confused. 

I have in restricted on Instagram (meaning, he cant see that I saw his messages), so I will just wait to see if he says something so I can just tell him I'm not interested in being with him again. The problem is that, because Im living abroad and we share some friends in this country, we will probably bump into each other in the next couple of months (that is why I didn't just block him). 

Anyways, Im not interested or comfortable with being with him again that way and even though I will miss having someone and I really liked being with him, its not like we were that serious, so I will just move on and hope to find a good person in the future.

**Edit 2**: 

I texted him saying it was fun while it lasted and he agreeed ending things was for the best and was very nice about it. Like some people said here, he is not a psychopat, he is just young and stupid and need to work on his own problems (and he told me several times about them during our short relationship).

He rarely drinks (this was the first time I saw him drinking and we went to clubs together twice) and this was just a very stupid move from him. With this said, Im not going back to him and will remember the good memories but always knowing the bad things.",TwoXChromosomes,3529,1638177377.0,357,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/r4rypw/the_guy_ive_been_seeing_just_revealed_his_true/
When reaching out to the “other woman” goes right,"Saw a post on here earlier about not being afraid to reach out to the “other woman” and thought this story might fit here. 

When I was in my early 20s, I met a guy named David through my roommate. They were coworkers. She was going out for drinks one night with some people she worked with and invited me along. He was cute in that Jeremy Allen White sort of way and we hit it off. He got my number and we went out on our first date the following week. Because of his work schedule, he only had Wednesday nights off consistently so that’s usually when we would meet up. After a few weeks, we have the exclusivity talk and alls going well. 

One Wednesday night he was over at my place and excused himself to go to the bathroom. I heard his phone ding and looked down, not because I was purposefully trying to snoop but because NOISE. I saw it was a text from a girl. That’s not what bothered me though. What bothered me were the first two words of the text notification, “Hey Baby….”. Not sure of what to think, I jotted down her name really quick. He came back from the bathroom, we had a nice night, he wasn’t weird or protective of his phone, but I really wanted to know who this girl was. 

Now, I’m not one to advocate going out of your way to snoop, but I personally see no problem with if something doesn’t sit right, check it out. So I went to social media and found her name in his follows. His page was mostly posts about activities he does like hiking, camping, or working on his car, no real photos of him or anyone except family.  I saw they had a couple of tagged photos together through her page, mostly group photos, the latest from a few weeks prior, but one stood out. It was a photo of just the two of them with just the number 2 and some heart emojis. It was posted 8 months ago and underneath were a slew of comments saying congratulations. 

So I bit the bullet and messaged her. I spent well over an hour drafting a message trying to not make myself sound like a creep or crazy, and ended up going simple, “Hi, do you know David X?” I of course was on pins and needles for hours waiting for her to respond. I was running every possible answer she might have in my head, and starting to second guess myself, talking myself into how I’m a crazy b*tch. Maybe they dated, broke up, but decided to remain friends? But that “Hey, Baby” still nagged at me. Obviously, you’ve figured out where this is going, and sure enough when she eventually responds late that night, she says, “He’s my bf, why?” 

I could have died right there on the spot. I wrestled with what to do. I was sad and angry for me because I liked this guy, but I was also sad and angry for her if she didn’t know. Ultimately I just told the truth, “I’ve been seeing him for a while and just found out about you. I was under the impression that our relationship was monogamous. Here is my number if you want to talk”. Within ten minutes, we were texting. Turns out they’d been together for over two years. My roommate had no idea he even had a girlfriend. She had never seen her or heard him talk about her.

We talked about the basics, how long they’d been together, how we met, how long we’ve been together and so on. I figured out that we mostly met on Wednesdays because that was the day she was most often at work. I couldn’t stop apologizing. I felt awful both for me and for her, and we agreed to meet in person to talk more. 

We met at a cafe downtown. I’ll never forget she ordered a coffee and when it was my turn to order I told her, “I think I’m going to need a beer for this conversation.” She actually ended up ordering a cocktail. She said she hadn’t told David she knew about me yet. She had made excuses not to see him. I told her I hadn’t said anything yet either, figuring I would defer to whatever she wanted. I asked if she had any thoughts about staying, and she said “Hell no. Fuck him.” I asked what she wanted me to do. I was trying to be respectful of what she wanted and how she wanted to handle the situation. She looked me dead in the face and said, “I want him to see us in the same room.” I’m not one for confrontation. Like at all, and I wasn’t expecting this to be how she wanted to handle it. The idea scared me shitless, but I agreed to it because somehow I felt like I owed it to her? She texted David right there asking if he wanted to come over later that night, and he said sure. We ended up having a few more drinks and continued to talk. I think in a messed up way we found camaraderie in each other and by the end we were both sad but cracking jokes at his expense. 

We met up later at her place, about 30 minutes before David was set to come. We had a few more drinks for liquid courage, me more than her probably. I drank a lot of wine that night. He arrived and she opened the door. He stepped into the living room to see me sitting on the sofa. He went pale, like absolutely freakishly pale. He didn’t say a word. He just turned and left, slamming the door on his way out. She ran after him screaming, “Got nothing to say? Seriously? Screw you!” 

We sat for a while, passing what an asshole he was back and forth, and we hugged before I left. I went home and had an embarrassing level cry. Full blown ugly, snotty sobbing. I didn’t expect to hear from her again, and I didn’t plan on reaching out. But then a couple of days later, she texts me. Saying that the news was out on both sides of their families and David was pissed. David ended up harassing both of us for a few weeks saying we ruined his life because I guess his parents decided to cut him off financially. He had apparently told them he was trying to save up for an engagement ring and they offered to help supplement the bills while he did that. Whether or not there was any plan to actually buy a ring, I have no idea. His ex and I ended up texting every time he reached out to one of us, and we actually slowly built a friendship over those weeks. We started grabbing drinks to go over the messages he would send us or the things we would hear. I would give her updates from my roommate who he worked with, and she still stayed in touch with his mom off and on. We have no idea if David had any other girls or if it was just me. But at least for us two, there’s a happy ending…

She’s now one of my closest friends and we’re now both in happy and stable relationships. She got married four years ago to a great guy and I went to the wedding with my current partner. We’re able to laugh about how we met now, especially since this isn’t the usual outcome to stories like this. 

Also David if you read this, thanks for helping me find a friend, but still fuck you.

Edit: since this post got a bit more attention than I was expecting, I sent the link to my friend. She’s loving you guys comments! And she wants me to make one edit…

David, if you read this, thanks for helping us BOTH find a friend, but still, from the bottom of BOTH our hearts, FUCK YOU.

"I landed a dream job, but now I'm being let go because a guy I rejected is falsely accusing me of being inappropriate.","Hi, throwaway for obvious reasons. This has been a devastating past few days, and I’m trying to figure out how to move forward. I have proof of all of this and am prepared to present it.

I (28f) landed a dream job that involves occasional travel. This role was promised to go on for several years, though I’m only away for a few days each month. I met Paul (not his real name obv) (28m) the first weekend I was on the job, and he seemed super nice. For context, I have a partner whom I've been with for nearly five years, and despite his job making us long distance for the first half of this year, our relationship is strong.

On my second trip, during a day off, I began chatting with Paul, and we hit it off. He seemed emotional, sweet, and didn’t make me feel weird in the slightest. I brought up my partner right away, and we talked about his recent breakup. I mentioned that things were difficult with my partner being away, but that they would be fine. Nothing felt out of line until the end of the night, when Paul asked if I would go back to where he was staying with him. I said no, but he persisted 3 or 4 more times, and I firmly said no every time. I went back to where I was staying, and he had found my Instagram, followed me, liked a bunch of my pictures, and sent me 3 DMs asking me to come to his hotel room. I did not respond.

The next day he apologized, and I decided to forgive him and move on. I still liked hanging out with him and the rest of the team and didn’t want to start any drama. I deeply cared about the job. He would text here and there, but never with anything sexual. I genuinely thought we had moved past it, and as months went on, our relationship felt extremely pleasant. Occasionally he would say something flirty or sweet, but I’d brush it off—it felt harmless. I became really good friends with another girl at work, and the three of us kind of became a unit. He would message me when he was heading to grab food so we could all have it as a group, and everything seemed completely normal. 

On the final day of my last trip, he messaged me at meals to see if I wanted to join him and, at the end of the night, even offered to help me transport some heavy things after he was already done with work (our job requires long hours). While we were walking, he asked about my relationship, and I told him that things were going much better. My partner and I were communicating better, he was home, and I felt better than ever about it.

I left, and everything seemed normal. He texted me while I was in the airport heading home and said things like, ""You should come hang out in \[where he lives\]"" and ""I would be so much happier if you and \[other friend\] both lived here."" Everything was super nice and normal feeling.

A few days later, he messaged me again, and when I asked how he was doing, he told me that he was dealing with some mental health stuff. He had gotten a bipolar diagnosis and was changing his medication to see if that would help. I sent him messages of support, and that was that.

A few days ago (about a week since we last texted), I received a shocking email from my bosses. Apparently, he had gone to his bosses, saying that I had been inappropriate with him. To quote directly, he stated that we were friends, but recently there was an incident where i had crossed the line and been inappropriate, and he was uncomfortable with me returning. And because of this, they were not going to have me return to the job. This shocked me to my core. I have never been accused of something like this, and I take it very seriously.

I have zero clue what incident he is even referring to, as the last time I was on a trip, we were never even alone together, except when he helped me carry stuff.

It’s apparent to me that the entire time he was attempting to manipulate me into cheating on my boyfriend and sleeping with him. It seems as though, when he realized this was no longer possible, in his mind, I became a bitch who must be destroyed.

He is attempting to ruin my relationship with my employers, my reputation by painting me as some kind of predator, my mental health, my finances, and has made me feel extremely violated. He has stolen a dream from me, and all I have done is be nice and supportive to him. The email from my bosses made it seem as though I was some kind of crazy person who is obsessed with him when this is not at all the truth (and I have the receipts to prove it). Just to add to the crazy, I recently saw that he sent me TikToks less than 24 hours before I received this email from my bosses. Meaning that he likely sent me those AFTER reporting me.

I have already responded to my bosses and said that I would like to have a Zoom call with them to explain my side of things and that the only one who ever behaved inappropriately was Paul.

My question is: what are my rights? Where the hell do I go from here? My dreams feel ruined, I’ve barely been able to eat or sleep. I feel so wronged and angry. I’m planning on writing a statement to read to my bosses and have all screenshots lined up and ready to show them.

**Update 1:*** firstly thank you so much for the support. I appreciate it. Especially people who also shared their stories, it means a lot and i’m so sorry. I think my post was a bit confusing (i’ll update it slightly for clarify)- in the email from my bosses they did inform me that “because i make him uncomfortable, they are taking me off the job”. This is only because he has more seniority and security at the company and is obviously bullshit. Second, tomorrow night i am meeting with an employment lawyer. i’ll let everyone know how that goes. Oh and i have screenshots of everything :) Thank you and KEEP RECEIPTS. 

**TLDR:** I (28f) landed a dream job that involves occasional travel. A coworker made advances toward me, which I rejected. Despite this, we stayed friends, and everything seemed fine. Recently, he falsely accused me of being inappropriate with him, resulting in me being let go from my position. I’m shocked and devastated, as he’s ruined my dream job, reputation, financial stability, and mental health. I’m preparing to defend myself to my bosses, but I’m unsure of my next steps.",TwoXChromosomes,2101,1723411084.0,169,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1epvrdz/i_landed_a_dream_job_but_now_im_being_let_go/
"Husband Died, Now Creep Neighbor is Lurking Again","Several years ago, when our daughter was a baby, my husband and I became friends with a neighbor down the street who also had a young daughter and similar interests as my husband. 

He is a single dad who has his daughter half of the time. Prior to the pandemic, he and my husband would hang out in the garage, ride motorcycles together, etc. We went to church with him a few times. He’s very, very Christian. Gave us bibles with our names on them. 

He had girlfriends occasionally and we would socialize as a group. Since he didn’t have family around, we would invite him to join us for Christmas or thanksgiving, sometimes Easter. 

Then the pandemic happened. I stayed home with the kids. My work dried up. My husband had to go into the office every day as a first responder. Since there was nothing open, the kids were going stir crazy. I’d take them out to play every afternoon. 

Looking back, it was like clockwork, he would come out at 4 to chat. Sometimes other neighbors would be out. It was nice to have social time. My husband would get home, talk a little bit, then go inside. 

I didn’t think anything of it. Unfortunately, this is when my husband’s drinking problem escalated. Neighbor took notice of my husband being gone or inside, and I was so lonely from being locked inside with two young kids all day. I was happy to talk to anyone. 

Unfortunately, I didn’t realize me talking to him was giving him the idea I was interested in him. I never told him anything other than I was frustrated with my husband not wanting to come out and hang out with everyone. I let him know I felt alone, and if my husband was being distant with him. He said no. I let creep neighbor know the pandemic was hard and my work was drying up. 

So he hired me to take a portrait of him and his daughter. I was excited because it was the first work I had all year. (I am a creative and have a photo and design service.) When I got to his house to set up, he wasn’t ready and his daughter wasn’t there, I asked if he wanted to reschedule, he said no. 

The session took a long time because he kept stalling and going upstairs for an extended period of time. I should have told him to hurry up or I’d be breaking down and going back home. He claims he can’t decide what to wear. I knew better than to go upstairs alone with him. Something felt off. 

During the phot session, he claimed he couldn’t button his top collar button and asked me to help. I didn’t feel comfortable and reached out, but it wouldn’t move, I withdrew my hands and felt icky. Then rushed to try and end the session. 

When I got home, my husband was mad at me (and drunk) accusing me of sleeping with the neighbor. I was aghast and shocked. He said I took too long and was dressed too nice to be over there. And said neighbor had stopped texting him several months ago. I had no idea neighbor was only communicating with me. He always told me he texted me and my
Husband. It was heated arguments between us for two weeks and I stopped communicating with the neighbor, realizing he had crossed several boundaries and was coming onto me. 

My husband and I tested a theory he had that I was being watched on the cameras. My husband would leave for a walk, intentionally going by the neighbor’s house and within 5 minutes I would get a “how are you?” Or “do the kids want to play text.” 

My husband and I wrote letters to him and said the friendship was over, and not to talk to us again. He complies, it’s super awkward, but it’s obvious is intimidated by my husband and leaves us alone. 

At the end of last year, my husband’s addiction led to him ending his life. I am in shock, my life is upended. Despite the addiction, I loved my husband and was trying to get him help for several years. I always held out hope he would seek treatment, it was too late by the time he did. The withdrawal caused him severe side effects. This is horrible. Nothing I would wish on anyone. 

Word gets out (though I tried to keep it private) that he has died. Neighbors avoid me and I’m fine with that. I don’t want to interact with anyone. 

Two weeks ago, I’m walking my dogs and they start barking at bikers. I hold them back and mind my business. When I get into the house with them, I see creep neighbor, on his bike, talking with people across the street from me. I shut the blinds so he can’t see into my house. 

I clean up, and as I go to leave, creep neighbor is now outside his house taking to more neighbors. I make it a point to look, with RBF expressions and get into the car. Rub my errands. Feel great about getting out of the house and living despite my deep grief. 

When I get back, there is a card on my front door. I grab it, set it aside and don’t pay it any mind. The next day, I open it and it’s from creep neighbor, expressing how much my husband meant to him, and it’s signed by him and his daughter (his writing, not hers). Asking to be friends again. Then a large, personal check falls out. 

What the actual fuck?!?!?!?!? I have been punched in the gut, my husband is dead! His friend betrayed him by coming on to me. We asked him to leave us alone. Now my husband is dead and creep neighbor thinks he can talk to me again?!? I’m livid! Absolutely disgusted. And fuck his money, I don’t want it, even if I needed it!! 

I will destroy the card and check, but what the fuck do I do? I hate this man. He betrayed my husband. He betrayed our family. He nearly destroyed my marriage. I was in therapy for months after the incident. He is a fake Christian for “coveting thy neighbor’s wife”. He thinks he can buy me? What the fuck? 

He’s a busybody, and touts his Christianity so other neighbors think he is a “good man” so it’s my word against his. I’m a heathen who doesn’t go to church. My neighborhood is heavily Christian. I’m definitely an outsider. 

Moving is not an option as I’m now a widow, trying to make it work. I plan to ignore him. And not address the card or check. If he tries to talk to me, I plan to say, “No.” and remove myself from the conversation or area. 

I have cameras on the house, but I’m constantly fearful because I know he’s watching. 

If you made it this far, thank you. I just need to get this off my chest and in writing somewhere. ",TwoXChromosomes,1563,1740998320.0,140,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1j2fv9o/husband_died_now_creep_neighbor_is_lurking_again/
I no longer pass as a man and I'm having weird gender feelings,"I am a tall cis woman and until recently I had short hair.  My usual attire is jeans and a flannel shirt.  In the daytime, my gender presentation is mostly female (on rare occasions someone will take a quick glance, address me as sir, and apologize shortly after), but on a dimly lit street I'm consistently mistaken for a man.  

I went for a walk tonight and it was cold enough that I had to take my hair down to wear a hat.  It was the first time in years of walking at night that I've not felt like I was passing as a man.  I very literally thought, ""Oh, shit!  I'm not passing!""  It was surprisingly disturbing.  I hadn't realized the extent to which being perceived as a man made me feel safe.  I had gotten used to being perceived as a threat (women walking alone and sometimes even couples would clock me a few paces behind them and become visibly vigilant).  I adapted to crossing the street or taking an extra turn to avoid making others anxious.  Sometimes I crossed paths with men who would greet me with a friendly, ""Sup, bro.""  On those occasions, I'd respond and on hearing my voice they'd immediately apologize for misgendering me.  I never felt bad about being mistaken for a man.  

It felt good.  Hell, being addressed as ""sir"" in shops felt good.  The tone of it was respectful in a way that I have never experienced while perceived as a woman.  I have friendly interactions on a regular basis, but I've never had that type of deference directed at me as a woman.

I've had students refer to me with they/them pronouns and I was always more bemused than anything else.  I feel pretty firmly attached to she/her pronouns, but I also feel an odd sense of loss at the idea of always being perceived as female.  

I guess I'm wondering, do other cis women feel this way?  Should I open myself to thinking of myself as genderfluid or genderqueer?  Am I just reacting to a desire for safety and respect?  I'd really appreciate perspectives from cis, trans, and non-binary folks.  Does any of this ring a bell?


Edit: Holy moly, I didn't expect more than a handful of responses!  Thank you to everyone who shared their experiences and offered advice.  I have a lot of food for thought.

My fawn response went to fight and it shocked both of us,"(TW: assault)

So, hey, posting from a cool hot place of trauma, absolutely NO WORRIES if you need to skip this. …which is objectively a funny sentence to write considering the title of this post.

A couple things to know: I smoke on my front stoop and often get dudes trying to chat me up. No biggie on that, shoot your shot my guy, just leave me alone when I say no or are clearly disinterested. I’ve also been doing fight training for the past couple years, and I live with two roommates who are women.

Now, if you go through my post history, you’ll see I’m a sword lady. In fact, last week, I performed a sword fighting show (three shows a day for three days) that also used hand-to-hand combat - obvs I know stage combat is not the same as real combat, but my body is strong, I know how to move, and having been training for a bit, I carry myself differently.

At my core I’m a kind person, and I like swords and fighting in a fun, playful way. My fight partner is legit one of the loveliest people I’ve ever met, everyone I know in the fight community is equally awesome, we’re mostly just big ol’ goobers who happen to have Studied The Blade.

Cut to late at night in front of my apartment. I’m smoking (yes I should quit), and a guy rolls up and starts chatting. I’m really just trying to listen to 80s music and plot out a fanfic I’m writing but this guy decides he needs to be A Man.

He tells me he’s seen me around the neighbourhood. He’s seen my roommates around the neighbourhood (he had a nickname for one of them due to her distinctive hair). It escalated quickly: he tells me either he rapes me or I fight him.

Here’s me in front of the door to my apartment. I stowed my headphones and phone in one bra cup, put my cigarettes in the other bra cup, and said, “Fight.”

Now I know - my darlings I know - the best fight is the one you avoid. I would never search out violence. In fact the DM of my current Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign makes fun of us for always trying to make friends instead of going into combat. And here’s someone I don’t know inciting said violence - does he have weapons on him? I have no idea. Does he have pals nearby? Again, no clue. But he gave me a choice between rape and fighting and implicated my roommates in front of my goddamn apartment so I chose fight.

And this guy backs off immediately. I don’t know if he was trying to be “funny” by intimidating me, or he assumed I wouldn’t speak up, but he shrunk like Alice in a Wonderland not of his choosing.

That was so dangerous, but less dangerous than fawning, which I usually do. I felt like a dog protecting its home: it’s one thing to intimidate me, but another to threaten my friends who are sleeping peacefully and don’t need any of (waves hands wildly) this.

He called me a bitch and rode away on his bike. Fine. I’m a bitch. I guess mostly because I have that dog in me.

A few takeaways from this:

1) This really fucked me up and I still feel scared, even though he’s not a threat anymore. But he might be? What if he comes back with his bruised ego and a weapon? He knows where I live. I don’t think he will, but one never knows. I’m lucky that I know my neighbours and the hood likes me, so I’ve been telling people about him, and have had very kind reassurances from my block.

2) I am so glad my body is strong enough after so much work that it’s like “Oh fuck you” when threatened. I didn’t freeze, I didn’t fawn, and I’m used to doing only those. There is absolutely &lt;i&gt;nothing&lt;/i&gt; wrong with using either of those survival tactics (10/10 would still use both in different situations) but wow, I didn’t realize how strong I’d become and how differently my vagus nerve would react until put in this situation.

3) I’m smoking on my front stoop as I write this. Been meaning to make a point-and-click horror game about smoking on my stoop and I think I finally have a boss battle.",TwoXChromosomes,1918,1723522625.0,178,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1eqyrev/my_fawn_response_went_to_fight_and_it_shocked/
"A simple explanation of why compliments, greetings and other ""innocuous"" greetings are not as harmless to women walking down the street as people seem to think.","Between the original video and the parody one, I see a lot of the same reactions, generally from men. ""But that's not catcalling! Lots of people just wanted to say hi or good morning!"" ""She gets more compliments in 10 hours than I get all year."" ""How am I supposed to get to know someone if I can't even say hello?"" ""Ok, maybe being talked to is annoying, but come on...harassment?"" and ""Oh, yeah, it must be REALLY HARD being attractive.""  I get it. I understand that when you haven't experienced something, it's hard to understand. So I'd like to give to a brief explanation as to WHY it feels so awful to be shouted at every few minutes while you are just trying to exist in this world. 

Let's pretend you have something lots of people want. Maybe you're famous or rich or powerful. In fact, let's go with something lots of people on reddit understand: let's say you're a whiz at computers. You've always been great at them, and when you hit college you finally decided to make it your career. 

Of course, people know you're a whiz. When you were in high school, your parents always had you fix their computer, and maybe they made you go over to your grandparents house and teach them how to do simple stuff on it. It wasn't a big deal, and you liked using your skill to make other people happy. It made you feel good to be acknowledged for your talents, too.

But as you've grown, your social circle has widened, and now that it's your career path, everyone knows that you're a whiz. And the requests start coming more often. Your friend thinks he has a virus. Your cousin who you never speak to is having an issue getting his printer to work. A facebook ""friend"" wants to make a wordpress site and heard you were good at that. Your brother in law just can't get his wireless router set up. 

It starts to really grate on you. You recognize a pattern...someone whom you don't talk to that often will send you text, email or facebook message, and it always starts off nicely with the ""how are you""s, but within 3 or 4 minutes of small talk they will get to what they really want. You realize that the more you do for people, the more they want; and if you accommodate everyone, you would never have any time for yourself. So you decide to start being more assertive and tell people (nicely) ""no.""

Well, that was a fucking mistake. There is now hostility in your family because no one can understand why you were so rude to Uncle Joe, it would have just taken you a half hour to set up his new monitor, why would you be such a dick about it? And now you've been unfriended on Facebook by several people, your boss is pissed and you're worried now about job prospects down the line. 

You obviously handled that poorly, you think. But you're still unwilling to spend 5-10 hours a week doing favors for people who seem pretty ungrateful, so you just change the way you deal with requests. You don't sign on to social media much anymore, and emails keep getting ""lost."" You try to ignore as many requests in as many ways as possible, thinking that if you don't say no, people won't get angry. Weeeeell, that was a lost cause. People are just as mad as before. In fact, it seems that the only thing that will make people happy is to do what they're asking...no one seems to care how this impacts you, because they just want what they want when they want it. 

This starts to color all of your other interactions. Now, every time an old friend randomly wants to reconnect with you, you get a knot in your stomach. You read emails knowing that at the end of all of the sucking up and small talk,  there's a good chance for an ask at the end. And because you've had so many hostile reactions when you tried to stand up for yourself, all of these reactions are now colored with that. Maybe your old middle school crush really is just trying to say hi, but you've been through this before and you know the odds are on the fact that she wants something from you. This is now the way you look at most people. It wears you down. You don't understand why people can't respect your right to just be left alone, and why you can't find a space that is free from all the asks. You know your dread at seeing a simple facebook message seems unreasonable, but damn. If people only understood how many you get, and what it has led to. It's become a big thing in your life somehow, and you fucking hate it.

Now, this little comparison isn't really the best, because it doesn't deal with the actual scary shit that women get constantly...being followed in the streets, sometimes with people in cars. A guy walking down the street and putting his arm around you while he starts a conversation. The touching. The slurs of ""slut,"" ""cunt,"" or ""whore"" when you ignore someone. The threats. The occasional actual violence. 

So yeah, I guess some people see someone saying, ""Mmmmmm...good morning, mami!"" as a nice greeting. But when it is constant, when it is colored with years of experience, when you JUST WANT TO WALK DOWN THE STREET AND LIVE YOUR LIFE....it is gross. So gross. Someone earlier mocked the fact that it was only 100 example of harassment in 600 minutes. When you have random strangers (an ALL men) talking to you every five minutes, when it seems like they all want something from you and there is no good way to respond to it, a simple twenty minute stroll just becomes exhausting.

Sorry for the length of this, and I doubt anyone will read this novel I've just written, but I wanted to explain why this feels the way the way it does for people who simply can't sympathize. I hope this maybe helps a couple of people understand why even ""innocent"" interactions feel very charged for the women who experience them.",TwoXChromosomes,2979,1414672774.0,2877,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2kry4i/a_simple_explanation_of_why_compliments_greetings/
Talk please just talk.,"Hello all,
I love my wife and our relationship has not been easy, her friends didn't like me (actively warned her off) my parents did not warm to her and her parents disowned her for getting a boyfriend without approval add to that the day we met she was on the rebound that afternoon dumped by her last BF.

We had no money, no clue and here we are almost 23 years later still together and still in love, we have dealt with cancer and now full renal failure, I am giving her home dialysis (I turned the lounge into a bedroom with full access to a 55"" TV hooked up to a gaming pc, oculus rift, gear VR, Alexa etc and all her crafting stuff).

What made it possible for us to go through all the tragedy and hardship we did?

We talked.
Three days into our relationship my mum was working a night shift and I invited her over once mum left, I know what you're thinking a hot night of sex, actually, all we did was go up to my room and cuddle on my single bed talking.

We discussed everything, it was the scariest event in my life, we told each other our flaws, we discussed past problems, we discussed likes desires and fetishes, we discussed our sexuality and my debts, nothing was hidden nothing was judged, we discussed every subject from hentai to Cthulhu and bared our souls to each other.

Before we knew it morning came and we were still together, so talk early in your relationship, let them know everything about you, if they run then it was never meant to be, if they stay then you have a chance and if there is something in your life you can not share with this person you want to spend the rest of your life with then honestly ask yourself why.

Talk before you waste half your life just talk and find out if this is real and right.

A lot of the problems we see in this place could be solved by talking.

Love isn't easy, love isn't like in the movies it takes effort, communication and time, with the right person the harshest of tragedies will bring you closer together not force you apart.

------
Thank you, everyone, for your good wishes and to hear from others who have experienced this is great, like everyone is saying it takes effort, sadly it is so much easier to not talk and it can be scary but it will tell you very quickly if this is the right person.

You can have completely different jobs, hobbies and come from completely different sides of the world but if you can communicate if you can share and talk no one loses out.

My mum had a picture on her wall and it said something like ""it's not just about looking at each other sometimes it's about looking in the same direction""

------
A couple of people have asked why I posted this here and not somewhere else, I have read this subreddit for a long time posted a little but have seen so many problems that could have been helped, I see amazing people who for many reasons get into situations that cause them life-changing problems, I see trapped people who are pushed to a point they have to fight back to save themselves and in reading a lot of the history at least some, just a few if even just one person reads this and can sort out problems before it gets to a bad point or get out before the damage is done then to me its a good thing.

Reading all these responses from couples who made it work by talking who did the same we did makes me so happy and if that can be an example to anyone who is trying to work through problems then thank you all for posting.

That is why I posted it here because over time I have seen so many problems that talking could have helped before things got bad.

Thank you to all for the amazing good wishes.

This is amazing, never expected to get this kind of response, It was early morning and I just finished a post on the Dialysis sub, it is all still new to me and a big thing to take on at home, my wife was still asleep (night time dialysis) and I was just thinking about everything we have faced together over the last 20 years, I started to think about what really matters and how much we still love each other and how much talking matters.

Wanted to pass on something to help others.

My wife is an amazing woman who I always wish that I could do more for, I guess that comes with being a carer for someone, I have heard it from others, you never feel like you do enough, you can't take the pain away you can't heal the illness, it does not matter that rational tells you people far smarter than yourself can't fix it.

Ever since she got ill halfway through college she never complains even though she has every right too and look at me if I get flu or a cold I am terrible but she is dealing with Cancer, Diabetes, Arthritis and now a full renal failure and she still manages to smile and fight it all.

Damn woman is a hero in my eyes yes maybe I am biased but honestly never known anyone who has been dealt such a rough card.

Her birthday is coming up soon and I am still trying to figure out a surprise for her, my main idea was trying to get a letter or something from her favorite actors or shows but getting in touch with film and TV type people seems to be almost impossible these days which is understandable.

Time for me to cook although I may just order take out tonight, thank you to all of you who responded to this, you really did make my day.

-------

A couple of people asked about my wife's illness. 
21 years ago while at college she fainted on her way to class after months of misdiagnosis we finally found out it was Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia with Philadelphia Chromosome positive, this is classed as a childhood cancer and in children, it is easier to treat but in an adult with the Philadelphia positive it is incurable.

They did chemo then removed some of her bone marrow then blasted her body with radiation killing off her marrow then reintroduced her ""cleaned"" marrow they had removed, this was all to force her into short-term remission.

At this point, she was put on Interferon alpha 2b which kept a certain protein at a certain level meaning cancer did not come back but that medication caused a lot of side effects including Arthritis and muscle wastage, we coped with that okay for 19 years I became her primary carer.

For some reason, that medication just stopped working and the counts started to rise, we went on to Imatinib which once again kept the cancer away but the side effects hit her like a truck.

Diabetes type 2 kicked in and her counts became really unstable, then this Christmas her Kidneys started to fail, tests were done and no way to stop it, they hoped with the support she could last 18 months but her Kidneys began to fail in February and went down to 8% functionality which caused a huge increase in liquid mass in the body, her legs alone gained 8kg of water meaning she could not even raise them off the floor, the liquid quickly began to encircle her organs and lungs, that is when she ended up in hospital.

3 weeks in hospital (came home on the 25th April) I turned the living room into a bedroom, I was trained up on home dialysis Peritoneal and now her counts are slowly going in the right direction but it will take months before she can walk again even in the house.

Unfortunately, she can not have a transplant because whatever damaged her kidneys so badly and quickly is still around and if it is the medication keeping the cancer away its sort of a mute point.

-----

Someone mentioned doing something for my wife's birthday, I would love to but I have no idea how that would be possible to do so safely or even allowed, someone with a lot more knowledge in this kind of thing would have to advise me but thank you for the offer and idea.

-----

This has been a wonderful day thank you, I just helped set up wife on Dialysis and waited till she was sleepy before coming upstairs (promised her I would start gaming and enjoying myself on the computer again, I have skyrim VR and a good setup but spending 99% of my time with her, I know its good to have a break and I need not burn myself out).

As people liked the words from one of my mum's pictures I remembered another one ""it's not the breaths we take that measure our life but the moments that take our breath away"" I always really loved that one.

I have never believed in love at first sight simply because a person's looks can change, physical attraction is okay for a fling or fun but for love well I do believe in love at first talk, that first night with my now wife sitting in a club talking for 6 hours like no one else existed, I just knew this was the person for me.

-----

If this is against any rules please just edit this part of the post out, a lot of people have asked how they can help or if they can do something for my wife's birthday in June, so I have added an Amazon wishlist to my profile and chucked everything we are planning for in the future, no one has to look no one has to do anything, I am only putting it on there because people asked and suggested, if this is against anything in this sub please remove this part, because this post is doing a lot of good and goes beyond anything else.

----

I have had some very interesting discussions in relation to this post, thank you so much, I want to add a couple of points due to those conversations.

I hope and I have tried in no way to beat the male drum in this post, if my wife was not ill she would have posted this herself, she has read it and from either of our perspectives the lessons about talking, trust, respect and honesty which make up communication come from both of us, it was not me or her who pushed for open lines of communication it just happened together, I also know that communication can not fix every problem and not all situations are salvagable but no matter what happens going in or out with eyes and ears open is a good survival trait.

Someone mentions how this would not go as well if you were broke.

When she got ill I was working for a basic wage at a small computer shop fixing problems, she was at college, we had no emergency fund and very quickly I understood she needed 24/7 help so we talked and I became her carer, this was a joint decision.

Things have never really gotten any better financially except we budget really well, we do not smoke or go out, we do not own a car and have not been on holiday for 19 years, fortunately, the house we are in now while not perfect is ours, we have learnt to save up over time and buy things on sale, to avoid impulse buys and instead take time to think about it while saving up, yes we have a well kitted out house of technology but all of those things were budgeted for and when you are stuck in the house 99% of the time Books, games, films and tv shows become a lot more important, when you can no longer even go down a local street then a powerful computer with Virtual reality is amazing.

People say they can't save but spend £50 at the weekend on drink its all about priorities, our priorities have always been making the house as entertaining as possible and make sure we have personal space because you may think to stay in isn't too bad and it is not until you can't physically step outside the front door and a 20 year prison sentence is not good for anyone.

She is the best of me and challenges me to be the best I can be.

As no one has shouted at me it seems to be okay me having a wish list in my profile but I wanted to explain a couple of items on the list, we have a few lifx bulb paired with our first gen echo in her bedroom this means if she wakes up during the night she can activate the lights both her own and mine if she needs me, unfortunately both are a little worse for wear out of warranty and only respond 60% of the time, its on my to do list.

The other unusual item is the bbq, I am currently working on the garden in my spare time so she can spend time outside and paired with her high protein diet (dialysis) removes it from the body, it seems like a no brainer, foil wrapped fish with mushrooms onions and peppers anyone.

Once again I am only putting that on my profile and mentioning it because people asked, all are on our budget and to do list and will get done anyway.

Inadvertently got a creep at work to leave me alone,"I'm on a new weld line, in a new area of the plant. I'm not to familiar with the 6 people around me but one gave off super weird vibes.

He complimented my hair, which is newly pink orange and purple, and super long, which I expect from strangers. It looks great!

The next night he comes up to me and asks if I like mermaids. At this point I'm gauging where he is at mentally, cause that's a weird way to start a conversation with a person you don't know, and his cadence when he speaks is a bit slower.

Then he pokes me right in the shoulder and says ""you should get one tattooed right here!""...... I'm wearing a men's undershirt (or A shirt? I think they're called?), and he just jabs me. I'm immediately on guard and say I have plans for that area and he accepts this and walks away.

Fast forward about two hrs and he comes up to me again and asks ""Can I call you foxy?""

""Uh. No? I'm not a fox, and do you even know the horrible sound they make?"" and I literally start screeching and making crazy ass noises. Right. In. His. Face.

He kinda goes ""Oh... Uh. Okay."" and leaves.

I tell my line lead and found out that creep has stalked two women he knows of, one quit without reporting him and the other one's husband scared him so bad he left her alone after that... But he still knows where they live.

So, trust your gut ladies. I knew the moment he touched me I didn't like where this could go. Thankfully, I'm a bit of a crazy person who will do awkward things to make people feel weird and leave me alone.

If he does or says anything sideways again I'm getting a supervisor involved. I know I should have with the foxy comment, but I feel like my screeching was an obvious sign to leave me alone.

We shall see. I'll update this story as needed. I just needed to share this story because these little red flags get brushed off. Hell, even I was making internal excuses thinking he had developmental issues until calling me foxy.

LISTEN TO YOUR GUT not your rationalization of what their behavior could mean.

Edit: I had the naive idea not to report this creepy incident, but you're all correct in getting the paper trail started. I'll speak with my area lead and foreman Sunday night when I go in. Thank you all for pointing out my reaction will not be the next person's reaction and I'd hate myself if I found out that he creeped on anyone else. Thank you for the confidence boost. I can do this. I won't let them make me feel bad for feeling unsafe.",TwoXChromosomes,4929,1570880446.0,377,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dgu1mr/inadvertently_got_a_creep_at_work_to_leave_me/
Just because he's on the spectrum doesn't mean he should get a free pass to stalk and harrass you,"This happened about 5 years ago but my cousin just had something similar happen to her and it brought my frustration back all over again. Sorry if this isn't the right sub 

I used to work at a well known shoe store and everyone loved my boss. Hell, I did too at first. He loved joking around and didn't seem to take things too seriously which was a nice change from my previous job of being a waitress. About 6 months after starting, my boss hired Jimmy (not his real name). Jimmy has autism and we all did our best to make him feel welcome and feel a part of our team. At first, he was cool. A little odd but he was funny and we all enjoyed working with him. That is, until us girls started noticing some disturbing behavior.    

Throughout the day, part of our job was to walk up and down the isles to straighten and organize the shelves of shoes that customers had either left strewn across the floor or put in the wrong place. One day, I noticed Jimmy peaking around the corner just staring at me. When he noticed me looking, he ran off. I thought it was a little weird but continued working and quickly forgot about it. The next work day, I kept getting the feeling that someone was watching me but there would be no one around. 

When I started getting more paranoid about it, I noticed Jimmy was again hiding behind the rows of shoes just standing there and staring at me. I started noticing that he was following me around the store. I would say things to him like ""hey, this is my area to clean, thanks for the help but I have it covered! You should probably go check on your area"" in the hopes that he was just looking for something to do and was too shy to ask or something. That is until one of my female coworkers came up to me and asked if Jimmy was following me around the store, too. Apparently, not only had he been following me around, but all the other girls as well. It made us all extremely uncomfortable. I decided I was going to say something because it wasn't just me at this point. 

When I went to my boss and explained the situation, he laughed. He told me that we all know Jimmy was autistic and that we were over reacting. That he probably had a little crush on us and didn't know how to deal with it but he was harmless so don't worry about it. He made me feel like I was just being a bitch and that I was judging him because he was on the spectrum. I needed the job so I sucked it up.  

Over time, his stalking got worse and, because he knew we had complained and nothing came of it, he got more brazen. He was no longer hiding behind shelves to watch us work, he would stand right behind us while we worked on shelves and openly follow us around and not do any work. It's like he was getting paid to follow and ogle us. He would follow us out to our cars at night and we would soon be seeing him follow us around places like Walmart or McDonald's. 

After awhile, we all decided to talk to our boss together. None of us felt safe at work and it was getting to the point where some of us didn't even feel safe at home. Again, our boss made light of it and tried to guilt us all for judging someone on the spectrum. It was at this point that I started looking for another job. 

I had planned to stay on until I had another job lined up but instead, I ended up quitting on the spot. Blatantly, in front of customers and coworkers, with a big smile on his face, he grabbed my ass. He squeezed me so hard it actually hurt a bit. I asked him what the hell was wrong with him and he just laughed and said that it was ok because he's autistic and doesn't know any better. That was it, the final straw. I walked to my locker, gathered my things and left without looking back. 

Now that I'm older, I wish I would have gotten the police involved. I wish I had stuck up for myself better, that I had protected my coworkers from this creep. Instead, I was guilted, shamed, and ran away. I can't change the past but I'm hoping my story can change someone's future. Just because someone is on the spectrum, doesn't mean they can get away with sexual assault. It doesn't give them a free pass to do as they please. If someone makes you uncomfortable, please speak up.


Edit: Thank you all so much for your overwhelming support! I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it has. For all of you who have shared your stories, thank you. Thank you for showing me and others that we are not alone. For those of you on the spectrum and are speaking out, thank you for your support and understanding.",TwoXChromosomes,5222,1596201942.0,301,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/i17gwz/just_because_hes_on_the_spectrum_doesnt_mean_he/
"My roommate is pressuring me into a threesome, and I clearly don't want it.","My roommate and I have been living together for almost a year now. We're both the same age (23) and have a lot of things in common. At one point we were very close and people even said we look alike. Since both of us were working at a furniture store, it was easier to live together and split the bills. 

A couple of months ago, everyone was notified on WhatsApp not to report to work till further notice. We later found  out our boss had a lot of issues going on and the bank was auctioning  some of her property, including the building where the furniture store was at.That's how we both lost our jobs without even being paid the previous month's salary.

We never thought it would take this long to get a another job. We were both actively  searching for jobs online and in person. I didn't know she had started looking for alternative sources and was considering hook ups. So she met this guy, who happened to be a client from our previous workplace and knew both of us. He has some kind of fetish and was asking her if we could have our hair looking the same and put on same outfit. In short he wanted a threesome with us, looking like twins.

He was willing to pay atleast $300 for each of us, and my roommate tried to convince me into it.
At first I thought, we do it once then just pay some of our debt which will buy us time to clear the rest. But I just can't bring myself to do it. I also don't know how to be intimate with people I have no emotional connection with. And now, my she went from asking me nicely to harassing me saying she'd rather live alone and she'll get me kicked out.

Yesterday I found out she's been talking to the landlord on my back. She's forgotten last month I sold some of my stuff so I could buy food for both of us. Normally, both of us would give $380 to budget for rent and other bills each month. Since last month, none of us had paid our share of the rent and by 10th, we would be owing the landlord two months.

The landlord  knows we both lost our jobs and has been very patient. I don't know what she said for him to threaten to put me out of the house if I don't pay my share on time. She has manipulated the landlord against me and I feel betrayed by her. We're both in the same situation and yet she's only trying to pressure me into agreeing to the threesome. I don't know how I'll get to pay my share, but I am certain this is not what I want. I just don't understand how someone will come up with something like that and just manipulate me to follow through without even considering how I feel about it.
What should I do? Should I just avoid her and forget about this or after getting a job just move out? I had already sold most of my stuff just to keep us going, and now when I'm on my lowest she's turning against me. I have nothing against sex work, it's just something I can't get myself to do. I care about her as a sister but I feel like this time she really went out of line.",TwoXChromosomes,2339,1688557775.0,258,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14r8ezg/my_roommate_is_pressuring_me_into_a_threesome_and/
“No GROWN woman lives like you”,"I posted the following post on another subreddit and got nothing but nasty messages, one in particular stood out. The redditor said I must be a young woman or a teen because “no grown woman lives like you”. As if I’m struggling on purpose. Maybe I’m alone in this but I’m actually in my late 30’s and YES, I know how pathetic my life is right now. So I decided to repost it here hoping I’m not the only one. 


 
On thursday my utilities got turned off. Yes I know about local resources but they are tapped out. I’ve had to play the “pay this or that” game and that didn't make the cut even though running water is an absolute need. I got really lucky that my neighbor is letting my daughter shower before school. I don’t know if that will last as long as it takes me to pay to get it turned back on but I’m hoping. I don’t talk about my medical issues but I have a lovely mix of Crohn's disease, POTS, endometriosis, and fibromyalgia. I started my period two days ago (sorry TMI) and I swear everyday after the first day is hell for me. I use a menstrual cup because it's the most cost effective option. 


Around 10pm my body decided to have a flare up. I don't think I ate anything “wrong” but I knew I needed a bathroom STAT. I wasn't going to bother my neighbor in the middle of the night so I walked to the nearest gas station. Finding a 24 hour bathroom after covid is near impossible in a small town. After three rounds I started to feel light headed and the “sparkles” in my vision started.  


I was trying to remove the cup and it slipped. IFYKYK what a mess that can be. The only thing that helps is laying down. I can’t walk back home yet because I knew I wasn’t done using the bathroom. So the UNISEX bathroom floor is where I laid. I didn’t have time to make a toilet paper layer either. 


Top 3 dirtiest places I’ve found myself and as I was laying there I felt something on my leg. I thought it was just fluids (I know, gross. Sorry). I looked and it was a huge freaking roach on me. Cue the crashout of the century. I did two more rounds and tried cleaning myself up as best I could using gas station toilet paper and the hand dryer. 


I feel absolutely disgusted. I’m sore and inflamed. I’m sitting on the curb praying I can make it home and that I’ll have enough baby wipes to clean myself up better because I hate feeling nasty.

I (F) just discovered my boyfriend made sexual AI images of a girl we both personally know. I’m completely shattered and don’t know what to do.,"I don’t even know how to start this.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We live together. We were talking about our future and marriage. I truly believed he was “my person.”

Last night, I found AI-generated sexual images on his phone… of a girl we actually know in real life. Someone who trusts both of us. The images had those pink X’s to bypass AI filters, but it was obviously sexual.

The moment he sensed that I had seen something, he panicked and started deleting things. Like, instantly. That reaction told me everything.
And what hurts even more is:
this is not the first time he’s done something like this.
He did something similar in the past, cried, apologized, manipulated the situation until I forgave him.

Now I can’t unsee it. I can’t breathe. I’m shaking even writing this.

I had to pretend everything was fine because it was my mother’s birthday. I smiled through the entire evening while something inside me was collapsing.

I feel betrayed, disgusted, unsafe, and confused. I don’t know who I’m living with anymore. I don’t know if I should tell the girl (because she deserves to know), or if that will damage my family and her family. I don’t know if I should report him, leave him, confront him, or quietly walk away.

I’ve saved what evidence I could, because the way he reacted scared me.

I need perspective from people who aren’t emotionally involved.

What should I do?
What legal options exist in India in case I don't want the girls involved to get affected by this?
Am I overreacting or underreacting?
How do I protect myself right now?


I feel so lost in every way. I don't know him or even myself anymore. I can just hear judgement of people how can she be with someone like this? How low are her standards? How is she doing the right thing by not even letting the girls involved know and make decision for themselves?",TwoXChromosomes,640,1762670203.0,135,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1oscbol/i_f_just_discovered_my_boyfriend_made_sexual_ai/
"Was sexually assaulted, called the police. I've never been happier :D","I finally followed my own advice! 

I was walking back home when an old dude stuck his hand down my shirt and between my boobs. (The credit card.) I immediately yell at him and tell him not to touch me and ""why do you think that's acceptable behavior"" etc. 

After I make a fuss, his friends tell me that ""he's drunk"" and ""I should let it go."" Nope, that's for me to decide, not them. He's walking straight and not slurring his words. Just an amplified jackass. 

His friends are cackling and laughing and tell him to apologize to me, and he bows exaggeratedly and throws the most sarcastic, over the top, mocking ""I'm sooo sorrryyy."" I guess from his condescending demeanor that I'm not the first woman he's harassed. And he likely has no problem doing it again. Also, he sexually assaulted me and I'm pissed. 

I tell him to accompany me to the police station, and ofc he refuses. He then exclaims, *""Call the cops, take me to court, sue me, you're only going to end up embarrassing yourself!""* (How my grandma explained it was, in this country, the older generation believes it to be shameful to be sexually assaulted because you were ""probably dressed like a harlot and basically asking for it because only dirty girls get touched."" [Basically what I was wearing, for reference.](http://76.my/Malaysia/w8-32054-long-sleeve-dress-color-black-size-s-m-l-ysystore-1302-02-YSYstore@42.jpg))

Challenge accepted. He knows that most women in this country wouldn't call the cops. Now, I may look like I'm the same people as him, but I grew up in the US and I'm a shameless, bold, unabashed gal from beautiful *America. Too bad for him.

I call the emergency police line and head back. There had to be over 25 police officers that came to my aid--an entire crowd in uniform. They surround the guy, ask him his side of the story and try to get him to calm down. I was instructed to hide somewhere he couldn't see me and identify him as he came out. He's screaming hysterically and yelling at the officers. 

Now, I must admit, the looks on their faces were so satisfying--better than Christmas. They were in utter disbelief that some girl had the *audacity* to get the police involved. To them, it's a harmless prank. She's in a bodycon, so she's asking for it. It's nothing for the police to get involved. It was just a touch, why is it so bad? She obviously enjoys the attention. 

kek.

I expressed that I didn't necessarily want him to get in trouble. I just wanted someone in an authority position to explain to him that in 2015, you're not allowed to touch others sexually without their consent. Most women here definitely would not report such a crime, and the thought that he would do it again to someone not as shameless made me extremely uncomfortable. I didn't want him to get away with it again. 

Anyways, I had to catch the last train home, so the officers gave me a ride to the station. I don't know what happened to the guy, but I don't care too much. It actually took a TON of courage to pick up the phone and dial the police, but I realized that I had nothing to fear. Safety is #1 and, holy moly, did I feel safe with a crowd in uniform. They didn't treat me with victim stigma or like a dirty girl. They were sincere, and seemed like they were glad to help. At one point, I started crying and one of the officers told me to buck up because I had to be strong. The guy was still yelling at the cops and he said that I couldn't lose to him. Good guy officer said exactly what I needed to hear. 

____________________________________________________________

Thanks for reading. Just wanted to share my experience and what I learned. I was so dumb to be more scared of dialing the police and reporting my assailant than actually being assaulted. How silly. 

I also doubted myself for a split second because of the guy's words. But TBH, I actually thought, ""What would 2xc say?"" and IMMEDIATELY snapped out of it. Thanks for reminding me to stand up for myself! 
Getting the authorities involved really helped me understand that I was not only justified in my actions, but also, it blew away any doubts I had before.

TL;DR: Called the cops after being sexually assaulted. I've never been prouder of myself.

Edit 3: I was surprised at the number of respondents too. It would never happen at home in the US, but our crime rate here is ridiculously low. I wouldn't doubt it if there wasn't another incident that night in the area, so I don't believe I was ""taking them away from something more important."" I expected one officer on a bike, and I also really didn't ask for an army. Not all of them stayed the entire time either. As for pressing charges: I return to the US in a little over a week. Personally, I want to enjoy the rest of my time here, and it might be selfish, but I'd rather just spend time with people that I won't be able to see for a while.

What's the proper response??!?? I was too upset to think.,"I was walking my dog (a German Shepherd) about an hour ago when I heard sex/passion noises/talk from the open window of a car that had pulled up next to me. I was at an intersection, thought maybe it was just part of the intro to some song I don't know, and kept going across the street.

It was not the intro to a song I don't know.

It was a man playing porn in his car, following me and masturbating. I couldn't think properly and walked for a little way, trying to stay as far away as possible. He turned the volume up. I crossed another street. He pulled up again. I yelled to get the fuck away from me. He followed me. I ran. He followed and pulled up next to me again. I ignored him as much as I could and finally some people approached (never having seen what was happening). He finally drove off.

I feel so stupid and embarrassed because I didn't know what to do and couldn't think. I'm a grown woman. I have a German Shepherd in part to keep people away from me. But I felt frozen and just kept walking so my sweet pup didn't react when the man wouldn't leave me alone.

After another two blocks, it occurred to me that I should call the police. I did that and gave the best description I could. But by then he was gone and I said I just wanted them to have the information in case more women report him. I didn't request an officer come out because I thought it had been too long by that time, and what was the point?

I wish I hadn't frozen and could have done something. 

What should I have done?

ETA: THANK YOU to everyone for the support and good advice. I was too shaken to come back to my post to read everyone's responses yesterday, but I've looked through them all this morning and found a great deal of comfort in them, as well as much I want to try to train myself to be ready to implement without having to think it up in the moment (my natural response, as many of you pointed out, seems to some sort of combination of freeze and flee).

 I'm already working with a dog trainer (I want full voice control) and I'm going to ask him to help me train my sweet man to appear more menacing (side note: I still can't believe my German Shepherd wasn't enough of a deterrent in the first place) when I need him to.

Thank you again, everyone. Your kindness, your sharing of your own stories, and your wisdom warm my heart and remind me that good people show themselves when others need help.

ETA2: I may have been deluding myself earlier. I tried to take my dog for a walk and couldn't do it. I felt followed all the time. No street felt safe. I still feel all the gratitude I expressed earlier. I also think I was trying to pretend to myself that I'm fine, not physically hurt, shouldn't be bothered by it anymore.

Casino security just called on my boyfriend because of the way he treats me,"Firstly, I know my relationship is fucked it’s a god damn mess and for some reason I refuse to leave it.

I like bought this trip to Vegas for my partner and sometime when he drinks he gets so nasty out of absolutely bo where. We got back to the room after a lovely day and I asked him what he was doing on his phone. It just hit midnight so I thought he would want to hangout with the dog and I. He said something like leave me the fuck alone. I was sitting there talking with the dog and he just started getting all aggressive and I was like I’m going to take the dog for a walk. He flipped out and was like your not taking my dog anywhere. I said okay I will walk alone. He said get the fuck out of here or something. I got to almost the elevator and I heard someone sprinting full spear behind me. I tried to hide around the corner but he found me and he started yelling at me. Like where’s my fucking key you took my key. I didn’t have his key. I was like I don’t have your fucking key it’s in the room. He was like then take me to the fucking room.

Is my sister's boyfriend being creepy or am I just overreacting?,"  Hello! I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub for advice but I (17f) really need help from my fellow women. 

 5 months ago my sister (26f)  began her first romantic relationship with a coworker (34M). My sister is head over heels in love with him and is intent on marrying him but this man has soooo many red flags.  He repeatedly made misogynistic and weird comments and were unapologetic for any of them. 

Some examples are:

1.He said that women should not get annoyed when they are catcalled because they are being complimented.  

2. He feels that women should dress conservatively and if he sees women wearing things he finds ""trashy"", they are automatically ""hoes"". 

3. When me and my sisters said that we are terrified when we go out because we have to constantly be aware of dangerous men, he laughed and said that he follows lone women around to scare them and when they start walking faster he speeds up. 

4. He believes that boys can sleep around and date when they are young, but girl's can't, because ""boys need to know that they are loved"". 

5. He has stated that he won't date women his age because they are all ""used up hoes"".  (He even said he would date my sister even if she was 20 years old, and that's what he thought her age was when he asked her out.) 

6. He is constantly groping my sister without her consent. 

  This is just the beginning of all of his red flags and toxic qualities, but it would be too long to list all of them. I have communicated to my sister that her boyfriend is full of red flags, but she doesn't care and is intent on marrying him. 

 Now here comes the part where I need to know if I am overreacting or if he's actually a creep. On the third time that he came to our house he was acting weird towards me (or so i think). It was Christmas day and I was the only one he actually bought a well thought out gift for. He didn't get a gift for my other sister and for the sister that he is dating, he allowed her to use his subscription for a podcast (he didn't really know what to get her).The gift for me was expensive for his standards (he is very cheap) and he watched very carefully as I opened it. Afterwards, I playfully poked him on his belly, and when my sisters were upstairs he punched my in my thigh area (near my butt) quite hard.  Later, when my two sisters were making dinner and me and him were alone, he sat down next to me and explained that he specifically got that gift for me because he knows I like pictures and he seemed hurt that I wasn't looking at it. After that, we were all watching a movie and while my two sisters got up to check on the food, he got really close to me and put his arm around my pillow, and I noticed him looking at me. That night my two sisters were talking and I was standing up alone, I turned around and I noticed that he was flustered and staring at me.  When it was time for him to leave, he shook everyone's hand and made a joke, but when it came to shake mine, he looked into my eyes and was staring and breathing sort of heavily. 

The few times after he came over I noticed he would listen carefully to me when I spoke, and he doesn't even do that with my sister. When we all ate dinner together a flower pot was between me and him, and he said that he couldn't see me because of it (we weren't even talking, he just wanted to see me).  He also looked into my eyes and told me how big they were.  I subtly changed the way I walked so it would appear more unattractive and childish, but he noticed that and demonstrated to me exactly how I walked. He began provoking me and when I got upset, he told my sister how badly I was treating him. 

He has previously stated before that he likes small women and said that my sister looks like she is 14. I am smaller than my sister and look very young because I am only 17, and I wonder if he is acting this way around me because he is attracted to very young girls. 

I told my other sister (the one who is NOT dating him) that I was creeped out by his behavior, but she doesn't take it too seriously. He is coming over this weekend and I am very uncomfortable but she said that I could just eat lunch with him and my sister and go upstairs after. 

Am I overreacting? How do I get my sister to see his red flags? Please give me your insight and advice, anything is appreciated :)

I really appreciate your support, but please don't write reviews from my perspective 🙈



Hi everyone,

my post unfortunately got removed from r/solotravel, so I’m trying here instead.

I’m on a solo trip at a 5-star all-inclusive hotel (a gift I was really looking forward to), and something happened that really ruined my sense of relaxation. I’d like some advice on how to handle it.

At one of the hotel restaurants (the ""best one"" with 5 Stars), the man who introduced himself as the owner behaved in ways I found very inappropriate:

He kept commenting on my food like I was a child (“bravo” for finishing my plate, calling me a “good eater”, and even “scolding” me when I left some food). I told him to stop, but he continued.
He also asked me if I was texting my boyfriend and later even how old I was, which felt way too personal and not appropriate coming from someone who is supposed to be working as a manager in a professional setting.

I had strong headaches and told him I was on painkillers and therefore couldn’t drink alcohol. He dismissed it and pressured me into taking a shot anyway, which he also drank himself while on duty. He even said alcohol wouldn’t hurt with medication, which is simply untrue and unsafe.

Later that evening, he wanted to go out for drinks. I said “no” and only after he kept insisting I said maybe the next day. He then asked for my number, saying I could text him if I felt like it – which sounded okay to me at that point. But as soon as I gave it to him, he immediately messaged me asking if I was already sleeping (like 15 minutes after I left the restaurant), what I was doing and if I wanted to meet him for a drink right now after all.
Even when I explained that I wasn’t feeling well and wanted to be alone, he kept pushing and ended his messages with “see you tomorrow” and heart emojis.

He also mentioned he had “seen me” at the other Hotel-Restaurant that morning, which made me feel controlled.
I came here to relax, but now I avoid the hotel bars and restaurants because I don’t feel comfortable. I feel like my all-inclusive package is wasted because of this.

The worst part is how this made me feel as a solo female traveler. I realize I don’t want to go on trips like this alone anymore, because I’m tired of being watched, judged, and treated like I’m fair game just because I’m a woman on my own.
Honestly, I felt much safer and more at ease driving alone through the Czech Republic and even getting lost for hours in the mountains, which was something everyone had warned me would be “too dangerous.” Compared to that, being harassed in a luxury 5-star environment feels so much more violating, because it’s the one place where I should have been able to let my guard down.

My questions:

• Is this kind of behavior common, or is it totally out of line?

• Would you complain formally to the hotel/reception or the tour operator? Should I ask for a refund and send the chat history to the reception?

• Do you think leaving a public review is the best way to warn other solo female travelers?

It felt like repeated boundary-crossing from someone in a position of power. And it sucks that as a woman traveling alone I can’t just enjoy my holiday in peace, especially in a place where I expected luxury and relaxation.

What makes it worse is that he seems to be working in all of the hotel’s bars and restaurants. That means I would run into him everywhere on the property, and since he already mentioned noticing me in other places, I now feel like I’m being watched. Because of that, I honestly don’t know how I’m supposed to spend my last vacation day in a relaxed way.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

Thank you :-)

Edit: It was the Corissia Harmony Boutique Resort in Georgioupolis and the name of the restaurant was 'Ophelia'.

"While leaving a shopping center yesterday, a young woman begged me for help...","I had parked at the very end of the lot, as usual to avoid door dings fender benders. So it caught my attention when someone else had chosen to park adjacent to me. I normally take my time getting in and out of places, so I sat there for a good 30 minutes before heading in to the store. 

While shopping, I notice that a young lady and I kept crossing paths in the aisles. She would make direct eye contact, and I would respond with a smile and continue on my way.

When I was ready to check out, she was right before me in the line, but when another line opened up, I again notice her eyes follow me as I move to the other checkout. 

After paying for my things and go to return the cart, there she is again in front of me. This time she stops me before I get to the door and in a rather soft and nervous voice asks ""Is it alright if I walk out with you please?"".

I instantly knew something was wrong. She seemed scared. I took a quick look out the door and saw a man standing there with another fellow as if he were waiting for someone to exit.

I told her ""Sure. Of course"", asked her where her car was, and put myself between her and the guy waiting outside the door. He was definitely waiting for her, and seemed to mumble sighs of frustration when he saw that someone else was accompanying her and she was not alone.

Turns out this guy had been following her through the shopping center, and the car that had parked next to me at the end lot was her. She was trying to stay near someone she thought would help her, and was gathering the courage to ask for an escort safely back to her vehicle.

When I looked back at the guy she was dodging, he had ran behind the store where the loading docks are, and I made sure he left without following her again.

For fuck sake. When a woman says she's not interested, that means BACK OFF. I felt sorry for her, but glad she was smart enough to push through being timid and actually ask for help.

Edit: As a few others have advised, while this particular incident was not the case, there's apparently a real risk of female decoys used in human trafficking. Luckily it was daylight and there were other people peppered around us in plain view. This girl seemed to have difficulties with being vocal and firm, which may be why he persisted. Best to have staff call for security if you feel the situation poses danger. And thank YOU for being a friend.",TwoXChromosomes,4857,1641420497.0,192,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/rwy3q4/while_leaving_a_shopping_center_yesterday_a_young/
"I reported my rape and this is what happened. Unlike so many, I'M GLAD I DID. Here's what to expect:","This post serves several purposes. First of all, I want to encourage anyone who has been assaulted to report. I initially wasn't, but am so grateful that I did (details below). Secondly, I'd love to get advice on what I'm going through--especially from people who have been through the same thing. Finally, it's therapeutic to just write things out... or so says my therapist. Names and locations have been changed. I broke this into sections because I know it's long.

My name is Annie and I am a 25-year-old girl. I was raped by one of my best friends of three years, Adam, on Cinco de Mayo. I was sober, he was not. I was walking him to his car from a bar, trying to convince him to call an Uber when suddenly I was pulled into his backseat, my dress was flipped up, and he stuck his penis into my vagina, anus, vagina, anus, over and over, regardless of how much I told him to cut it out, how much I squirmed, or how much I pushed him away. 


**The Immediate Aftermath**


The following morning I woke up in a haze. I had grabbed one of my friends (Michael) from the bar who lived nearby and crashed on his couch. The following morning, I woke up to Michael getting ready to go to work. He encouraged me to go get a kit. I paused. My anus was in so much pain... but would getting a kit mean reporting? Did I have it in me to turn over my friend to the police? Kits take hours don't they? And then I remembered: that day, that Wednesday, was the day of my performance review. Instead of getting the information that I desperately wish I had for this case, I went to work. 

Working was miserable. I had only told Michael, who kept asking me what I needed to do. Get up. Get dressed. Drag yourself to work. Fill out paperwork. Write articles and pretend to care about PR campaigns and new clients. At about 3PM, I got a promotion to accompany my performance review. I felt ecstatic for about 15 minutes before my enthusiasm was drowned out by anxiety. What happened to me? I normally love my job. I. couldn't. focus. on. anything. 

Until Mother's Day, that Sunday, I went from crying all the time to feeling numb. I quickly fell behind on my work. I slowly started telling others what happened. I told my best friend, my work best friend, and my boyfriend. In the back of my mind, I was reminding myself that I had been through this before. I was sexually assaulted in college and made the *mistake* of going to campus police. Nothing came of it until two other people came forward about being assaulted, he was expelled, and then was caught molesting a 14-year-old girl. He is in jail now.

As sad as it was, I learned two lessons from that experience. **Tell your parents early. Get therapy early.**

So as I tried to sit through Mother's Day brunch, I watched how happy my family was. I'm aware that telling others is burdensome--it's a reality few are willing to admit. They are going to worry, they are going to feel pain for me. I felt like I was about to rip apart my family. 

Even so, I decided to tell my parents over email the following day after a very important therapy session. **One thing that really helped was that I outlined what I didn't want them to do.**

&gt;Right now, I'm anxious about a number of things. 
&gt;
&gt;1. That you'll think that because I'm out all the time, that it comes as less than a surprise.
&gt;2. That I flirt too much and asked for it.
&gt;3. That you won't believe me.
&gt;4. That you'll push me to prosecute (the truth is that I just want him out of my life, and an entire case sounds like the very worst process to go through). 
&gt;5. That you'll ask me to describe what happened. I am not excited to share--and am having trouble with disassociating.

Both of my parents responded almost immediately. Because I was having trouble eating, my mother offered to come over the following Tuesday--just one week after the incident--and make me food. Luckily, by that point, I started to feel overwhelming rage. I decided to ask her to take me to the police station--just in case I decided to prosecute. Mom was thrilled to accompany me there.


**Going to the police**


We drove together to the county police station at around 7PM. After waiting outside, a female police officer brought us out to a waiting area. She was... she was really the worst. She had me describe the rape in front of my mother, accused me of being drunk (as if that makes a difference?), and, after I told her that I had told Adam to ""cut it out,"" she said that it didn't sound like rape because I didn't outright say ""stop."" 

I don't know in what other world ""cut it out"" means anything but ""stop."" But that's neither here nor there.

She was joined by another officer--a male officer--who was far kinder. He brought me upstairs, closer to the detective who I'd eventually be working with, and pulled me away from others in the waiting area to collect the clothes that I hadn't brought myself to wash, photograph my scraped knees, bruised hip, and chaffed sides from where he had grabbed me, and had me retell him what had happened. He escorted me back to the waiting area where, in front of six other people in the waiting room, the female officer reappeared to chastise me for not reporting earlier. 

Finally, the detective emerged.


**The Detective**


Meeting with Detective Davidson was one of the most important moments in deciding to pursue a case. He took me to the back without my mother, where I wouldn't feel pressured to censor things for her. He started off by easy stuff--what do you do for a living, are you close with your family, etc. And then he had me describe the whole night in full detail. He asked me questions that revealed important things that I wouldn't have thought of--like how did I get out (pulling myself off of him and dumping myself out the side of the car), what time it happened (it must have happened between 9PM and 10PM because the event at the bar had just started), and I showed him texts that Adam had sent me, confessing a sense of guilt and dread and that he had driven home very drunk that night. 

Davidson was really the man who convinced me to go forward with charges. He said that I was in complete control of what happened--if I ever wanted to close the case, that would be my choice. He just wanted to get me to the point where, with evidence, a criminal case could be filed if I wanted to. 

The very first thing that he had me do, after taking my statement and affirming that he thought it was rape as well, he had me get a kit. 


**The Rape Kit**


Google where you can get a Physical Evidence Recovery Kit (PERK) if you need one. In my state, **it's paid for by taxpayers.** They didn't even take my insurance information. 

The hospital near me has an entire department dedicated to PERK. Walking into the center was devastating. There was a young--maybe 16-year-old--girl with cuts all over her right arm and blood coming out of her nose. She was obviously assaulted that same day. She was cowering with her parents and couldn't choke out enough to even give the nurse her address. 

My nurse's name was Claire. She was maybe in her mid-forties, kind, and gentle. She explained to me exactly what would happen. She would once again take pictures of my injuries, test me for STIs with both my urine and blood, and give me a physical exam. 

Little did I know, my anus still had tears from the assault, even a week later. She spread a dye over my anus and vagina that highlighted the tears. As she manipulated my anus, a place that is now so sensitive both physically and emotionally, I started to cry. She waited patiently and spoke soothingly to me. I kept repeating, ""What's more embarrassing than getting raped in the ass?"" This would be the last time I would be capable of crying, even until today. She snapped photos of my genital injuries and let me go. The entire process took less than an hour. From this exam, we were able to learn that there were signs of forced entry and that he had given me chlamydia. 


**The Phone Sting**


The detective continued to work closely with me. I was able to identify Adam's address, turned over my credit card statement to prove I hadn't drank much that night, and felt *better* as time went on. The case gave me focus--I still tell myself, ""You, Adam, messed with the wrong bitch."" 

In our state, we're able to call someone and record them without them knowing. The sting kit is a machine that hooks into my phone and records a phone conversation.  After not talking to him for almost two weeks at this point, I was able to get him to talk to me for about ten minutes with the hook, 
""Hey, you have chlamydia.""

Unfortunately, because this case hasn't gone to trial yet, I can't be any more specific than that on the sting, What I will say though is that Detective Davidson sat with me through it and wrote things down for me to say to Adam to try to get information out of him. We got a lot of what we wanted, but not everything. 


**What's next?**


My state is either going to bring him in for questioning or arrest him (without bail). I don't know the details, but my bet is that it will either be this week or next. This has all transpired over the course of less than a month. 

I wish that I could say I'm doing super well. The case, emotionally, has honestly been one of the best things for me. Instead of allowing my mind to wander about ""what ifs"" or stewing on the violence of the crime, I feel like this is something I can be proactive about. My negative energy is serving a purpose. 

With that said, I've had some really bad days. I'm still looking for a trauma specialist--everyone seems booked!--and art therapy is working just o.k. for me. I'm incapable of crying and I feel overwhelming rage all the time--sometimes to the point of hurting myself (no worries folks, I haven't actually injured myself). 

If anyone else has gone through this, I'd love it if you reached out to me. If you are going through this, going to the police *can be a positive experience.* Rape is a horrific crime--it's a tragedy that so few report. Hopefully this may serve as a guide to help you make the best choice for yourself in terms of reporting. 

**Edit**: Wow, this post really exploded. First of all, it breaks my heart to hear all the stories about rape left in the comments. I really feel for all of you... please, if it happened recently, consider getting a kit. You're not required to report, but, at least in my state, your medical care will be covered. For example, the state is paying for my chlamydia medication.

Secondly, I've been teary from all the heartwarming messages that you've sent me. I was able to be connected to someone who showed me how to get in touch with a local crisis center for therapy, and I've been talking to others that have been in the same emotional place that I'm in now. It makes me feel so much less alone. 

Finally, after the case concludes, I promise to follow up.

Thank you, stranger, for the gold. Never thought I'd make it to the front page with this story.

Am I wrong for wanting to spend time together?,"I brought my boyfriend to my house for the weekend since my parents aren’t home and he brought his video game. We never get alone time since we both still live with our parents, so i figured this would be a nice weekend. 

Well it’s not. He’s up till 3 am talking to his boys on his game, I wake up and he’s talking to the boys on his game. I don’t have a problem if he games, but this was supposed to be our time and it just hurts my feelings that I’m not getting any of his attention. I even called out of work yesterday for him to come. Last night at 2 am i asked if he was going to come to bed and he made a big thing out of it saying i make everything about me. He walks away calling me a “toxic ass bitch” gets further through the house and mumbles “stupid ass cunt” then proceeded to get back on his game. I just layed in bed and cried. He comes in the bed 30 min later and tried to touch me and I’m like did you forget what you just called me? This isn’t the first time he’s called me out of my name, and definitely won’t be the last. I just don’t understand how you can tell someone you love them and treat them like literal scum. I just woke up now and he’s still on the game. I know we need to break up, i Feel like it’s going to happen when i take him home. I just needed to rant a bit cause he makes me feel like I’m the bad guy and i know I’m not the bad guy for wanting to spend quality time.


EDIT: 
I did it!!! 
I know I shouldn’t have, but I took him home. The car ride was silent. He tried to make small talk like nothing was going on, but I just ignored it. Can’t remember how it started, but when i was dropping him off he was bitching me out about something so i just drove off with the door still opened and closed it halfway down the street… but yea i just texted him saying i can’t do this anymore and legit he’s just sending “ :( “ and then he said “but i love you to death and we can just start over “ it’s just pathetic honestly I’m glad I’m out. 

I also wanted to thank everyone of you for taking the time to help me out through this :) I’ve read all the comments at least twice now it’s just hard to respond to all. I appreciate the kind (and some not kind) words i needed to hear.

Sarah Everard and #notallmenbutallwomen," 

If you haven't heard, recently a woman was murdered in the UK, allegedly by an off-duty police officer. (Who was also being investigated for indecent exposure and has now been charged on suspicion of murder and indecent exposure)

This happened after she went missing after walking home from a friends house.

She was walking home.

On Twitter there was an outpouring of personal stories and outrage from women and some men that this is still an issue for women and that the onus is on women to protect themselves from women.

Some of those ""precautions"" being:

* Don't go out at night
* Don't wear revealing clothes
* Don't wear heels
* Wear headphones, but don't have music on
* Keep your keys close as a possible weapon

Clearly those aren't working. Women are punished and blamed for ""enticing"" unwanted male attention and I wasn't surprised at some of stories being shared on social media.

[UN Women UK](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/almost-all-young-women-in-the-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-survey-finds) found that 97% of women aged 18 to 24 in this country had been sexually harassed, while 80% of women of all ages said they had been sexually harassed in public spaces.

Sarah Everard was walking home. She was wearing leggings. It may have been dark, but why should we, as women, fear something so mundane.

We then saw the sad predictability of #notallmen trending. Men who had too much ego to realize no one is attacking them specifically, crying that people are being mean to men. Gaslighting, anger and *shifting of the blame onto women again.* Women know it's not all men, but it's enough men to not be able to know who to trust.

Then a new hashtag cropped up. #notallmenbutallwomen. There was another outpouring of women's stories and men listening to those stories and posting their reflections. Maybe it's just enough to get a conversation moving. We've had communication and understanding but there are still those who don't believe its an issue because they cannot see past their nose.

For me personally, here are a few of my experiences.

1. I was 11 - I'd just started senior school and the older grades would slap the arses of the year seven girls cause it was ""funny"" to them. Me included.
2. I was 15 - I was walking home from the cinema and a man followed me home after catcalling me from his car. I had to call my dad to meet me half way. I was wearing a winter coat and jeans.
3. I was 18 - I was waiting for the last bus home. I was sitting at the bus stop. In my uniform and coat smelling like B.O and BBQ sauce. Another guy was standing at the bus top, got closer to me over time and then whipped out his dick while I was looking at my phone.

I'm so tired.

EDIT: since it seems some trolls are finding this post here's some extra facts for you.

Estimates published by WHO indicate that globally about 1 in 3 (30%) of women worldwide have been subjected to either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.

Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost one third (27%) of women aged 15-49 years who have been in a relationship report that they have been subjected to some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner.

On average, there are 433,648 victims (age 12 or older) of rape and sexual assault each year in the United States.

82% of all juvenile victims are female. 90% of adult rape victims are female. Females ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault.

About 3% of American men—or 1 in 33—have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime.

The CSEW (Crime Survey for England and Wales) estimated that approximately 700,000 people aged 16 to 59 years were victims of a sexual assault in the last year. The majority of these cases will not enter the criminal justice system. Less than one in five victims of rape or assault by penetration reported their experience to the police.

The majority of victims were female, with approximately 560,000 female victims and 140,000 male victims. Women were nearly four times as likely as men to have experienced sexual assault in the last year

EDIT: More statistics more looking at Murder.

The Office of National Statistics found that men were twice as likely to be murdered than women. However women were three times as likely to be killed by someone they know. Someone they trust. The nature and motive of murder differs wildly depending on the victim. (Further edit to clarify - 

Within this report it is worth noting that there were only 698 murders/manslaughters in the UK last year comparative to 153,136 sexual assaults **reported** to the police. 

If we go by the stat that means 460 men did sadly lose their lives last year to violent crime.

Also going by the maths - 122,508 women were sexually assaulted (560,000 is 80% of estimate from the CSEW of reported/non-reported crimes)

**Meaning women are 266x more likely to be sexually assaulted than a man being murdered.**

"""And this is part of my training,"" he said, as he grabbed my ass.","I woke up later than usual this morning, after a late flight home last night. My fiancé was home getting ready for a long day and I went out to take the dog on our morning walk together, like we do every morning. I missed our morning walks while I was away and was happy to be home with my family. We're moving in two weeks and I was taking my time to enjoy the walk, groggily thinking about the neighborhood that I had grown to love over the years, as well as my general excitement about the future. In the upcoming months we're moving back to our hometown, my fiancé is getting his PhD, we're starting new jobs, and getting married. We're on the cusp of our next chapter and I wanted to take a moment to remember the last one.

On the last leg of our walk, I saw who I thought was a neighbor cross the street ahead of us and head down the block to a main strip nearby. Halfway down the next block towards my house, he was surprisingly behind us and gaining. I simply thought the neighbor forgot something and was heading back home. I don't know him well enough to turn around and engage him in conversation and when I glanced back he was on his phone. I heard him say something to the extent of, ""Okay, I'll be over soon.""

There was a party on the sidewalk last night for the opening of a little boutique, so scraps of food were everywhere. The dog was trying to grub and he took this opportunity to try to engage us. I quickly realized as I got a closer look at his face that he was in fact, not the neighbor I thought he was. I brushed off his attempt at conversation, feeling too tired to engage strangers on the street and figuring he'd get the point. He tried to keep pace with me so I made a point of stopping in front of the barbershop on the corner near my apartment. I smiled and waved to the barbers inside. I hoped the dude would get the point that this is my neighborhood and I know all the regulars around here. He didn't.

We kept moving and the dog stopped to grub again, and he stopped to pet her. I asked him not to, explaining that I'm trying to train her to not do this and rewarding the behavior isn't going to help. I gave her a gentle tug to keep moving, and he grabbed her bandana. I told him to let go of her, which he did. It was creepy but I made it to the door of the building, knowing that I could get inside the courtyard quickly and shut it behind me, instantly locking the creep out. I didn't expect what happened next. He said, ""And this is part of my training,"" and grabbed my ass as I turned to the door.

I saw red. I turned around, looked him in the eye, and pointed at him. I opened my mouth not truly knowing what I would say. I yelled, ""Fuck you! Fuck you! I'm going to kill you! Fuck you!"" He ran, I ran, but the dog froze. She was clearly afraid of my anger but soon started to run with me. I continued yelling as he turned the corner by the barbershop. I stopped in front and shouted, ""That guy fucking grabbed my ass!"" and they all ran out behind him. Motherfucker was quick. We lost him.

The owner of the shop apologized several times and I apologized to him for making a scene in front of their customers. He didn't care; he had just told me and the fiancé last week that he was going to miss us when we move because we were his favorite couple to see walking around the neighborhood. He put his hand on my shoulder and apologized again, then said that he never thought he'd see that side of me. I told him I didn't expect him to see it either. His daughter is close to my age and I knew he was probably thinking about her in that moment. One of the other barbers was walking around, pacing, angrily saying it was so fucked up. I probably mumbled some more stuff about being angry and in disbelief that it happened, apologized for disrupting their business, and then headed home. They weren't going to leave me on the street so they waited until I got back to my building before heading back into the shop.

I got home and told my fiancé what happened. He was obviously pissed, but he wrapped me in his arms and told me we needed to call the police. He said he heard screaming outside before I got home but didn't think it could possibly be me. His gut was to go outside and try to find this guy, but I told him he was long gone. I made the call, crying with rage, and then we headed downstairs to meet the police officer. They sent a female cop, which I instantly appreciated. While we spoke, she noted the camera behind me facing the door to the building. I had completely forgotten it was there, but she was right - it was brand new and everything must have been caught on camera. She took the property manager's name and number and said they would reach out to him for the video. The last forcible touching case she had that was caught on video allowed them to put out a warrant for the guy's arrest. She also said that since I knew the direction he was heading towards, her partner was already driving around the neighborhood looking for him.

At this point, I was starting to lose the composure I tried to maintain while talking to her. Tears welled up in my eyes as I explained to her that I was a teacher at an elementary school three blocks away. This was my neighborhood, my community, and I walked everywhere. This was unacceptable. I tried not to turn into a blubbering idiot while I explained that I worked at an all girls school and I fear for my students' safety walking around the neighborhood, given the recent increase in violence our city has been seeing. And now this. It was 10AM. If someone thinks they can get away with this in the middle of a Saturday morning, what are they willing to do under the cover of darkness? She agreed, and empathetically listened. It was what I needed in that moment.

We've contacted the property manager, who is pretty illiterate with technology but he tried to watch the videos anyways. He said the guy who knows how to operate the system will be back tomorrow and that they would make sure to go through it. I'm relieved to know that the cameras weren't fake and hopeful that the incident was caught on tape so that this guy can get picked up.

I often read posts on here. My heart breaks every time I read your accounts of sexual assault. I know my story was a minor one and that things could have been much, much worse. I can't claim to fully understand the pain of those who have experienced much more violent assaults, but please keep sharing them with us and others.

His words - ""And this is part of my training,"" were his attempt at a snide remark. He didn't realize how revealing those words were. We aren't doing enough to train our young boys that this type of behavior is not okay. Keep sharing your stories, keep spreading love and acceptance. We are a formidable force when we work together and I believe that we can empower future generations through the sharing of our experiences and emotions.

TL;DR: A dude grabbed my ass in the middle of the morning while I was walking my dog, saying it was part of ""his training"". I'm livid, and sharing my story.

"I was chased by a guy at night in the park, and I'm very frustrated by the reactions of friends.","Last night after hanging out with friends I (23F) had to walk home alone for about 20 minutes. A part of the walking route goes through a park with no light so it's always a bit scary. But last night I noticed a guy walking after me, he started to move closer to me. When I started walking faster, he walked faster as well. He started to come really close and when he was close enough I heard him sort off moaning to him self and saying ""I'm sorry baby. I'm sorry baby"" over and over. I was so freaked out, it was dark, no one was around, so I started running. He screamed some shit after me saying he wasn't going to hurt me. I ran untill I made it home.

When I was home I told some friends about what happened. I had some friends who were really worried but some of my friends just made some joke about it while others told me I was dumb for walking around there alone at night. I'm just frustrated that some friend didn't take it seriously at all and others laid the fault by me. I'm totally fine now, but just wanted to share my frustrations of not being taken seriously.  


EDIT: 

Hi everyone! I just wanted to do an edit because I just couldn't bring myself to answer to everyone, however I've read every comment and I want to say thank you! Thank you to everyone who shaired their support, you guys littarely brought tears to my eyes for being so nice! To everyone sharing their story about something similar, I'm sorry that happened to you and I hope you're staying safe!  

To answer some questions:   
\- To people saying I should get a gun, I don't live in a country where this is legal so this is not possible haha. However I did like the suggestions of buying pepperspray or getting self defense lessons, I will look into this!  
\- To people saying I should not have walked there at night. I already took the train home, but from the trainstation it's a 20 min walk to my home. We don't have Ubers here and I already took the longer route that goes somewhat around the park and not through it. I get where you are coming from but there were not a lot of other options for me.  
\- Some people told me to go to the police to file a report on this guy. I'm thinking about doing that.

Im happy about the discussion that has been sparked by this story. Reading about all your similar, or worse, stories made me sad but I'm happy people are speaking up about it.

"For the first time yesterday, a man backed off after I told him my age. I'm unsure how to feel and just want a men free place to rant.","Yesterday I was waiting for the train at night, and this man kept smiling at me.  I smiled back to be polite, I didn't want to seem rude or anything, and he headed over and told me his name, and asked where I was going. I was a bit uncomfortable, but in case he was just friendly I didn't want to offend him by assuming he was flirting, y'know? So I told him I was heading towards Brooklyn, and he asked if we could keep in touch. I told him I was sorry, but I was actually thirteen.

And here's the thing . . . he left? He apologized, told me I looked older, smiled, and . . . walked away? I get asked out by older men *all* the time (I look a lot older than 13), and this was the FIRST TIME someone had backed down. Usually they'll assume I'm lying, or just not care and keep flirting, or worst case, tell me I shouldn't dress like an adult because it's leading men on. But he was respectful and walked away. And I wanted to run over and actually thank him, because it felt so nice! I felt valued and respected as a person! And I wanted to just chase after him and tell him how much that meant to me.

And then I realized that leaving a literal middle-schooler alone after learning her age is the BASIS OF HUMAN DECENCY. How is that seen as respectable and laudable? How is walking away after learning you're hitting on a child seen as something you should aspire to do, instead of what's expected? How have I gotten to the point where I want to thank someone for not harassing me?

I'm so tired of this. Not to be cliché, but I fucking hate men right now.

**EDIT:** I've received a lot of angry dm's from men about my ""I fucking hate men right now"" comment. I'm sorry if it offended you, of course I don't hate ALL men, I was just frustrated and ended up typing that out.

I (28F) was at a party where a man (40s?) was relentlessly harassing women. Was I wrong for staring him down and protecting another woman?,"Hey everyone. My boyfriend disagrees with my assessment of a situation that happened yesterday, so I'm here for some clarity.
TL;DR Drunk creepy guy harassed women at a party, I stared him down and protected a woman getting harassed by him, and ended up taking the heat for it from him and my boyfriend.

Last night I was at an event where 50 or so people were camping together. I was with my boyfriend and 4 acquaintances. When we arrived this guy approached our group, Jack Daniel's in hand. He was speaking nonsense, I literally cannot recall what he even said it was such gibberish and he had a very thick accent. I instantly got an awful vibe from him - he started invading my personal space, getting offended when I moved farther away, trying to get a rise out of me and the other women in our group. They mostly just ignored him and even humored him occasionally. I didn't say anything to him except warning him not to touch me or approach me too closely which he repeatedly attempted to do.

He later stopped by our encampment saying nonsense about setting our camper on fire, murdering people, honestly I couldn't understand much else of what he said due to his drunkenness and thick accent. I felt super uncomfortable and just stared at him/ignored him when he attempted to engage, generally by trying to intimidate me (focusing solely on me, commenting on my demeanor, puffing out his chest and trying to make me flinch). Nobody said a word about this, just generally saying he was being creepy. Someone told me he was the best friend of one of the organizers and he was going through a divorce, Yada Yada. Everybody was taking pity on him. 

Whenever I would see him at the party he would deliberately go out of his way to antagonize me, saying things like 'oh, she hates me' and making rude comments. At one point there was a crowd listening to the live music and one girl was dancing (hooping, for those in the flow community). He kept 'corralling' her, harassing her, getting so close her hoop kept hitting him, and attempting to 'dance with her'. This went on for several minutes, and nobody around us was doing anything at all about it. I went up to her and asked, 'is he bothering you?' she replied 'only as much as he's bothering everyone else too'. I turned to him and blocked him from getting close to her again and told him he was too close. He puffed out his chest and started talking gibberish again, and didn't back off, so I said it again, louder, and he finally walked a short distance away. Then he kept approaching me, which felt really aggressive. I finally just walked away.

Every time he saw me that night he would make a big deal about it, arguing with me (I honestly have no idea what he was even saying, he was so wasted and it was a loud event). Saying 'hey, just one thing, hey listen, hey'. My boyfriend eventually started telling him to back off, but by then it was pointless. EDIT: my boyfriend corrected me, he actually did defend me after I stood up for hoop girl. I was wrong about this. 

Today I lamented to my boyfriend how sad it was that nobody spoke up about him and talked to the organizers about how uncomfortable and harassed they felt, even though several people talked about it with me and my group. My boyfriend told me that I should not have engaged. I should have just completely ignored him like everybody else did. I told him how scared I would have felt if it had been me dancing because nobody would have spoken up or helped me. He said there's nothing you can do in that situation, nobody would have removed him (it was a private event at a campground you must pay to access). Basically that it was a waste of time and I made it worse on myself.

Maybe he's right. I honestly don't know. I felt like I helped that girl, and I didn't let him walk all over me like the other women. She didn't talk to me about it later or thank me or anything, which gave me pause. What are your thoughts?

Edit: my boyfriend actually corrected me, he did stand up for me after the guy kept harassing me after I stood up for hoop girl. I totally forgot about that. I thought I remembered things a certain way but my judgment was clouded and I forgot that things happened differently. Please stop blaming my boyfriend for this, he didn't do anything wrong and I've misinterpreted this situation.",TwoXChromosomes,2249,1645463717.0,291,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/sxyshg/i_28f_was_at_a_party_where_a_man_40s_was/
"I scared a guy so badly after he groped me in a public park, and he crapped in his pants.","I was walking out of the AMC Loews theater on Boston Common at about 9pm on a Friday night.  I live in Cambridge, and the other movie-goers I was with were going in the other direction, leaving me on my own. The entrance to the Red Line T stop (subway) is across the street and down the block from the theater, so I was only outside for about two minutes before this happened, still well within view of dozens of people.


A man that looked to be at least fifteen years older than myself who was walking near me in the same direction took an extra step to catch up to me and put his arm around my shoulder and grabbed my breast, and said ""Hey"".


I'm small.  I'm blonde. I wear t-shirts, jeans and old sneakers.  I practice monstrous voices as a hobby.  One of these things came out to my advantage.


I pushed him off me, and in my most threatening bellow yelled, **""HOW DARE YOU TOUCH ME?""**  Please see the Vocaroo link for a low-quality replicated voice clip that I only wish could be as good as my fear-inspired ourburst: [Link to Clip](http://vocaroo.com/i/s0LO2ZylAaYG)


The guy froze, his mouth open and face in total shock.  I knew I caught him by surprise.  It took me a few seconds, between him standing funny and the smell to realize that he crapped in his pants.  


I looked around, and saw a few other people staring, probably because I had just yelled at someone in a park, and made an awkward walk away from the guy.  I was shaken from being grabbed, and got to the Park Street station as fast as I could walk.  


This was not the first time I was groped, and it will likely not be the last.  I can only hope that this one man will have felt some sort of primal fear, and will never touch a person without their permission again.

Also, if anyone cares, I was coming out of seeing Muppets: Most Wanted.  I fucking love the Muppets.

Some stranger tried OPENING THE DOOR TO MY CAR WHILE the engine was on and I (27F) WAS sitting IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,"I think I'm still in shock, with a bit of fear, and adrenaline...

I started door-dashing recently part-time after becoming burnt out from my previous job. So far, I like it! The work can be tiring (work is work) but the flexible schedule, the alone time, and the constant moving has a positive effect on my mental health.

Safety has always been a concern of mine. I take precautions such as sharing my location with a family member, locking my car doors IMMEDIATELY after entering or exiting my car, and avoiding late-night door dashing (8 pm - 12 am). Unfortunately, the area I'm in has the best peak pay at later hours, and  I've door-dashed late the last couple of times (I got bills to pay 😭) with no issues and no feeling unsafe.

Except, for one instant which I chalked up to being a one-off thing. Maybe, I should have stuck to my guns and never dashed late again to avoid what happened recently. 

It was about 9 pm and I stopped at a well-lit gas station for snacks and a bathroom break. When I returned to my car I locked the doors, munched on some snacks for \~5-10 min, and waited for some door dash offers to appear. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed someone walking close to my car and paused for a second or two. I was parked maybe 2 spots away from the gas station's entrance so I figured they were passing by and didn't pay them any more attention. That's when I heard it. ""KA CHINK"". The sound of someone trying to open the locked door to MY car while the engine is running with a seemingly unaware driver.

I looked at him bewilderedly (he looked to be in his 40's). ""I wasn't trying to scare you. I was looking for a ride (???)"", he uttered. This guy may not have known that I noticed him walking into the gas station with someone else. And I look nothing like his ""friend"". Also, if he thought I was an Uber or Lyft, WHY WOULD HE TRY TO OPEN THE PASSENGER DOOR??? (Their policy requires passengers to sit in the back). I gave him an awkward smile, put my car in reverse, and drove away. I feel like my space was violated. What would compel him to open the door to a stranger's car while they're inside?

Thank the Lord nothing worse happened. ""I wasn't trying to scare you"", he says. So WHAT were you trying to do then? Cause the math isn't adding up 😨😬😩

If anyone here has advice for additional safety measures or self-defense tools I can have on hand at any moment's notice, please feel free to share.",TwoXChromosomes,1358,1710321014.0,217,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bdmy8s/some_stranger_tried_opening_the_door_to_my_car/
"Man I went on one date with is mentally unstable, repeatedly harassing me, and is actively about to be employed as a police officer. Do I say something to them? ","This is a bit long but please read it all before commenting so that you get the whole picture. So I went on ONE date a month ago with a man, got such immensely bad vibes putting my entire body in fight or flight mode that I actually faked feeling sick to go home. I have never done this or had that feeling before. This person essentially would not allow me to Uber home, cornering me by his car, and insisted he take me home. At the time I panicked and just said fine because I felt my options were pretty much either refuse and he gets even more angry and possibly violent, or let him take me home and hope he is not going to do anything. I'm aware this was dumb, but at this point I was extremely scared and did not react properly because of that. 


Texted him the next day (after he called me multiple times that night after getting home) that I was not interested in anything further and didn't feel we were compatible, but thanked him for getting me home. He initially seemed to accept it after begging for a second date first, but has sense started harassing me regularly. Texting me at extremely weird times trying to start conversations as if nothing had happened, and like we've known each other for years. He once called me at 6am and after telling him it was extremely odd to call someone at 6am who doesn't want to talk to you he said ""okay I'll only call in the afternoon"" as if the time was the problem here and not the fact that he is contacting me at all. Since that incident I have stopped replying entirely. I haven't blocked since he knows my address and I feel it's even less safe to block and not see a message from him saying he is coming over or something like that. 


Got another message this morning saying it wasn't fair I didn't want to go out with him and I finally lost it. I told home that I've said at least 5 times now to leave me alone yet you don't stop. To which he thanked me for noticing his persistence and then ""Merry Christmas you beautiful menace"" (wtf??). It's clear that he is not even entertaining the idea that I don't want him, and is going to continue no matter what I say. I finally told him if he didn't stop I would be alerting the police station he is currently on the eligibility list for to become an officer next year, because this was not acceptable behavior. He then told me that I needed to leave HIM alone, and he was going to block ME and ""threatening people isn't cool"" and that I needed to seek mental help not him (lol). 


I don't think someone who clearly cannot handle rejection or accept when a woman is not interested should be considered for a role as a police officer in any capacity. He made many concerning statements about his mental health on our date, is currently a security guard now and felt the need to mention, unprovoked, multiple times that he had a gun but not to worry I'm safe because they background check him alot. I want to alert the department he's applying at about his behavior, but the fact that he knows where I live after being forced to be taken home I don't want to then deal with jeopardizing my safety if he retaliates were they to do something with his eligibility. 


What do I do? This man absolutely SHOULD NOT be a police officer. ",TwoXChromosomes,1252,1735063494.0,138,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hlizrd/man_i_went_on_one_date_with_is_mentally_unstable/
Men often DO pick up on predatory behavior without necessarily recognizing it for what it is,"I've been testing the theory that most men know exactly which guys are creeps without fully realizing it. They'll openly admit it, as long as you don't put it in those terms.  

If you ask the guys you know, ""do you know any men that might sexually harass, pressure, or take advantage of a woman?"" it's all *no way! I'd NEVER associate with a guy like that!*    

But they're thinking of the Boogeyman Waiting to Jump Out of the Bushes type, not the acquaintance/friend creep that is responsible for the majority of assaults.    

But if you ask: ""Guys know which guy is killing the vibe, right? The one who has no game with girls, is always a little too pushy and isn't picking up on their disinterest? You know, gets a little too ""enthusiastic"" and chases the girls off? The one everybody tries to keep from saying or doing something stupid?""    
I've asked a few men this, and they've all immediately said yes with no hesitation.  

They sometimes even tell a story of some guy that always ruins nights out by doing some weird shit. &amp;#10;  
A few of the more aware ones admitted that there'd been times they'd noticed a guy's inappropriate behavior on a night out and attempted to run interference in a nonconfrontational way. Usually, it was an acquaintance or friend of a friend that they didn't feel comfortable calling out directly.  

The problem is that most of them are telling these stories in exasperation. Framing it as these men as ""having no game,"" as *cockblocking* the rest of them, as them being an awkward idiot that's a bit too intense, as causing mild inconvenience, but **not** as being a creep who either ignores or doesn't recognize boundaries.   

But *women know.* The guy who is too aggressive, overly familiar, whose idea of flirting is to make demeaning or odd sexual references, who follows you around the bar/party. Who tries to touch you. &amp;#10;  
The guy who is either pushy and demanding or radiates a frightening sort of desperation. Who won't keep things casual, won't give up trying to hit on you. The guy who is pushing you to drink.  &amp;#10;  
The one who repeatedly doesn't pick up on/ignores your discomfort, nervousness, and polite deferrals until you're signaling to your friends for the whole group to leave. &amp;#10;  
**The one you'd be afraid to end up alone with.**  

The moment I explain that the thing they're viewing as ineptitude can be what women are interpreting as *scary,* some of them have an ""oh!"" moment, some of them are defensive.   

But **all** of them did have experiences with friends or acquaintances who they remembered as constantly chasing women off. &amp;#10;  
They're often just failing to recognize that what's ""killing the mood"" is the alarm bells going off for the women he encounters and that it's potentially more than just being awkward or inexperienced. &amp;#10;  
They know who would be *their* last choice to escort an intoxicated female relative home, even if they've never consciously thought about it.  

This **not** to say that being bad at flirting is somehow predatory. Being nervous or a bit awkward isn't the same as making someone feel pressured and unsafe. There's a massive difference between feeling uninterested and mildly annoyed vs feeling cornered and nervous about your safety.  &amp;#10;  
But the men that *are* potentially dangerous often have friends, have social groups, have people who may have picked up on their behaviors. &amp;#10;  
They hear his ""jokes,"" see his anger and entitlement towards women, see him push the line. They just dismiss it as awkwardness, cockiness, or ""locker room talk."" &amp;#10;  
They're not seeing it for what it is or recognizing the seriousness of it.",TwoXChromosomes,2584,1680462294.0,154,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/129uoe5/men_often_do_pick_up_on_predatory_behavior/
DAILY REMINDER - When Men Tell You Who They Are - BELIEVE THEM,"So it's taken me years to do this but girls, ladies, enbys, when a man tells you who he is, BELIEVE THEM. 


If a man says he's the ""ruin your life type"", do a 180 and walk away. 


If a man tells you he is/was a fuck boy and you're not into that, repeat step above. 


If a man tells you he's flakey and that's gonna irk you? Repeat said step.

I think this is the first time I've followed this rule without hesitation or wavering and I'm so proud of myself for it. It's taken me countless stories and comments on here to get it into my thick skull.

Some men have no idea how women actually live and it shows.,"Firstly, let me just say that I 100% understand that men have struggles too- many men don't get help for mental health, and are often not taken seriously when they are victims of abuse, for example. These are important issues that deserve to be taken seriously.

But oh my god, some of the things some of them always claim is ""horrible"" about being a man are just so detached from reality or self-centered. I recently read a thread where men were asked what was the worst about being a man. And I kid you not, here are some of the replies:

* ""It's hard to date as a man"" A lot of women get rejected as well. Not all women are sexy bombshells that have men lined up to sleep with them, a misunderstanding about how women live.
* ""We have to provide for the family"" ??? 99% of women work in my country  and earn their own goddamn money (which they had to fight to able to do) but sure
* ""Loneliness"" as if women never experience loneliness? Edit: I realized that I sound like a shitty person here. Sorry about that. Loneliness is valid in all genders and should not be belittled by anyone. Sorry.
* &amp;#x200B;
* ""Women don't want men with a low status."" Personally, I just want a respectful man who takes care of himself and acts like an adult and has a job. No crazy demands here. Am I supposed to lower my standards to date someone out of charity? Also, I'm pretty sure plenty of men also want women with status.
* &amp;#x200B;

And the worst ones:

* ""Women get scared of us when we walk behind them at night""
* ""Women are scared of us/judge us as if we're all bad""

Poor you. You have it worse than that woman who is literally fearing for her safety, knowing she will never be able to outrun or fight off a man. How are we supposed to know which men are bad and which ones are not? Do these men think that we can just automatically tell which men are gonna hurt us our not, like an inner radar? Of course we are scared, we have no idea who to trust in a world where 50% of the population are stronger than us! I'm gonna look over my shoulder and speed home when walking home alone at night. We don't exist to make men feel comfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

* ""Women can have an abortion even if the man doesn't agree"" Because it's her body, not yours.
* ""(cis) Men can't have children without a (cis) woman"" That's just biology.

What kind of warped view do these men have of women's lives? That we are all happily jumping around in bed with our 1000 friends, we never feel lonely, that we wake up with makeup and our hair done and have a harem of men lined up to please us endlessly?

The problem here is some men have no idea how women actually live and what our lives are like. They think our lives are like a typical romcom or a music video, and that feminism solved all issues. That being a woman is a dance on roses because we escaped the kitchen and are allowed to go to school, work and vote (the bare minimum).  They need to wake up.

(of course I am very grateful for my rights, I am aware I come from a privileged part of the world,  but there is still much work to do)

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should have explained some of my arguments better, but regards to the dating thing: my point was that a lot of men don't realise how much effort women put into dating. Makeup, hair, clothes, shaving every part of the body. My point was a lot of women put a lot of effort into dating and also get positive results from that

&amp;#x200B;

Edit again: After thinking a great deal I have realized that some of the things that men go through, I actually haven't looked enough into. I've been very dismissive and frustrated because of my own struggles, instead of actually listening and understanding the struggles of men. I think I need to do some work on myself.",TwoXChromosomes,1715,1654024203.0,324,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v1xoly/some_men_have_no_idea_how_women_actually_live_and/
My dad told me that women made up #metoo,"I'm visiting home for the holidays, and it's been about five years since I've made it back here (I live across the country and life happens.) 

It's been a great visit so far and I know to avoid politics, but somehow #metoo came up and my dad got visibly angry. He told me that he knows some sexual assault happens, but that the vast majority of women make it up for attention or to ruin men's lives. 

I told him about times I was sexually harassed at work (various examples from various workplaces) and one time that I was groped on a bus. I told him about the various times I was followed by men when leaving transit, walking to bars/ restaurants/ etc. This was an incredibly awkward and emotional conversation to have with him. 

He very angrily responded that MAYBE I've had these experiences, but most women are lying or they would have said something earlier, and that by calling various things rape 'hardcore rapes' won't be taken as seriously. He told me about how hard it is to be a man in today's society. 

I'm shocked and don't know how to respond. I don't think I'll be able to change his mind, but it's horrifying to me that he honestly feels that way.

I remember being 13 and motioned to by a car of older men with my friend when we were walking at night.... just two kids being kids. I remember being 14, and those same men leered at me, catcalled me, motioned towards me again, and then did a u-turn to follow me and I ran home crying. I remember being dresscoded by a man at this very school.


The same men that followed me still make me peek over my shoulder even now. I'm 18 now. I didn't wanna leave the house when I was 14 all summer, it took me so much courage to walk to the store in a skirt.


Wanna know who reinforced the idea that my body is the problem?

You did.

And it is so insane to me how a curvaceous, grown woman could inflict the same incident that she probably experienced growing up.

Not only did you dresscode me, but you even remarked that I should ""get a better fitting skirt."" Completely unsolicited. How quaint.


Wanna know a fun little fact?


I don't have clean pants today for school. I was going to wear a skirt instead, but I decided to spray perfume on my 6 day old pants to wear again because the thought of you calling me over made my stomach churn and I'd rather keep my breakfast down.

"My new ""bf"" is creeping me out","My mom is making me start hanging out with this guy because she thinks it'll make me stop liking girls. She says I don't have to do anything with him until I'm 18. Which would be a relief if my 18th birthday weren't in 2 weeks. I met him a few weeks back at a family party. Things got off to a bad start when he walked in on me in the bathroom. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that it was an accident. He just kinda made me uncomfortable the whole night. I can't point to an exact reason but I guess it was just a sense or something. 

I didn't hear from him for awhile but then he randomly showed up at my cheer practice last Thursday. I never told him I was in cheer so I have no idea how he found out. Well my mom probably told him. I really didn't like him being there. Cheer uniforms are pretty immodest and he's the last person I want seeing me dressed like that. Things got even weirder on Friday.

Me and the other girls from cheer went to a party Friday night. My mom would never let me go so I lied and said that I was hanging out at my friends house. Well the party had alcohol and I drank some just to fit in ya know. Well the alcohol was mixed with juice and it tasted really good. I didn't even taste the alcohol so I assumed there must not be much in it. I obviously over did it because I don't remember anything past like 10pm. I remember being at the party and then waking up in my bed. Later on Saturday my mom confronted me about the party and said she knew everything because my ""BF"" had brought me home.

Besides the embarrassment and punishment my mom handed down, I was freaked out that he had done that. My friend confirmed he took me home too. I don't even know how we knew I was there. My mom didn't know about the party and I obviously didn't tell my ""bf"". It's all just super creepy and I get sick thinking of myself unconscious in a car alone with him. I noticed some UTI like symptoms starting yesterday so now I'm scared that maybe he did something to me while I was asleep or too drunk to care. Ugh thanks for reading this overly long rant.

Edit: Some people are saying I'm fake because I use the word Pastor when I'm Catholic. I did some research and pastor is mostly only used in America where I live so that might be why some people aren't used to hearing it.",TwoXChromosomes,1414,1663596754.0,319,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xid7he/my_new_bf_is_creeping_me_out/
The old creep who grabbed my neck while volunteering at my local animal shelter has been dismissed.,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/s/ozwv39PhQ3

After sending my statement to the volunteer coordinator about the old creep who grabbed my neck and “pretended” to strangle me, he was dismissed by management. I was fearful that it would get swept under the rug because I live in a very conservative state (where many women are conditioned to tolerate sexism and inappropriate male behavior) but I’m pleased and relieved that there are still people with integrity and no tolerance for sexist creeps who grab women and think they can get away with it.

I’m proud of myself for reporting because I could have given in to fear, let it go and just never returned like many before me probably did. I could have kept listening to the friend who convinced herself that he was “just quirky, awkward, and autistic.” I have many friends with ASD and none of them have ever grabbed my neck and followed me to make sure I didn’t tell anyone.

After he was dismissed, one of the volunteers found out (the one who the creep referred to as a bitch) and thanked me and said it was like a huge weight had been lifted from her shoulders because she had reported him too. She had witnessed other volunteers avoid coming in when he was there. A friend of a friend volunteered at the same shelter  in 2014 and he had a reputation of being a creep back then too.

To anyone who has been, or currently is, or could potentially be in a similar situation: don’t let anyone try to downplay the situation, or guilt you or blame you for how you react to a predator. The type of criticism that victims receive creates fear of judgment and causes them to avoid coming forward. I’m sure he would have been dismissed sooner if women weren’t fearful of being blamed and judged.

Predators are sneaky. They can be charismatic and helpful, they can flatter you and tell you personal things to build trust and rapport. There are a million ways for them to get you to lower your guard. It takes only a moment for them to go from poking fun to getting you alone with their hands around your throat.

But I hope this outcome encourages others to report if they experience anything like this. And document everything. I had almost a dozen examples of sexist or inappropriate comments and bizarre conduct from him in my report, several of which my friend could corroborate. And after 15+ years, he can no longer harass the hardworking women at my local animal shelter.

Trust yourself and your intuition, especially when it comes to weirdos. Stay safe.

Edit: I was on the fence about filing a police report but after finding out he has been suspended and allowed to return in the past, I went ahead and filed it and he is being charged with a class c misdemeanor. I hope he can never work for the public around women again.",TwoXChromosomes,1795,1755392194.0,38,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1msdaxi/the_old_creep_who_grabbed_my_neck_while/
Apparently my work has a customer who is a serial sexual abuser,"I am a sales associate at a retail store. One night I was walking the store and some old man ran up behind me, laid his hand on the small of my back right above my butt, got close, and said ""hey, how are you, beautiful?"" I said ""fine"", and ran off and lost him. He came back 10 minutes later and started hitting on me again. I got rid of him and hid so he couldn't find me again, he eventually went home. I got so upset that I felt physically ill, like I was violated.

I get creepy old men all the time. They call me names and flirt with me all the time. But that was the first time one actually touched me. I told my female co-workers and most of them knew this guy.

One said he's always pestering her, trying to give her very inappropriate hugs. Another woman says whenever she see him, she hides because last time he offered to pay her for sex and said he was looking for a sexy woman to take with him on vacation. Nobody does anything about it because ""oh, he's just a lonely old man.""

Another coworker had two men following her, hitting on her and trying to get her phone number. After she repeatedly shut them down, they kept following her. Eventually a manager told them to leave her alone. They waited in the parking lot for hours for her and followed her to her car in a dark abandoned parking lot, she had to run.

Anyone who says sexually harassment isn't a big deal isn't on the same planet I'm on. We need to start holding men accountable for this shit because I feel as if people just don't care and brush it under the rug as ""oh, it's just a compliment"" or ""oh, they are just lonely"", fuck that. And if women as a collective don't do anything, they will do the same to others.",TwoXChromosomes,2949,1535730048.0,303,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9buo7u/apparently_my_work_has_a_customer_who_is_a_serial/
I was raped on Thursday and need to talk about the aftermath.,"I was by raped by strangers on Thursday night, my post history talks about that.

I told my husband Saturday night.  He was very supportive, but told me that we absolutely had to go to the police.  So on Sunday morning, we went in to the police station to... give a statement?  Open a claim?  Just tell them I guess.  I had never seen my assailants before.  I don't think I could recognize them if I saw them again.  I know how important it is to tell the police when something like this happens, but, I really didn't want to have to talk about it and relive it with a stranger.

We went in, and since the station is closed on Sundays, had to use the little hand held phone to tell them why we were there.  I naively was under the impression that I could say, ""I was sexually assaulted and need to talk to a police officer.""  I was wrong.  I had to tell the ambiguous stranger on the dinky telephone in the lobby my whole story.  Then he told me to wait while he called someone in to talk to me.  My husband and son were with me and we waited about 20 minutes for an officer to come. 

He took me into a tiny interview room, set up a recorder and a pen and pencil for himself, and asked me to tell him what happened.  He spent most of the time asking me what I feel were irrelevant details-- I gave him the address where my assault took place, and he asked me no less than three times what texture the wall I was pushed up against while I was raped felt like.  He asked me why I didn't have any scratches or abrasions on my face.  It felt like he didn't believe me at all.  He asked me over and over and over where exactly it happened and to tell him exactly word for word all the disgusting things my assailants were yelling at me before they attacked me.  I felt humiliated.  Then, he asked my husband to talk to him alone.

My husband said the officer asked him things like how long we'd been married, were we happy, why was I on a walk alone, etc.  I know these questions are important and he needed to ask them.  But I felt like I was put through the wringer and then dumped onto the lobby floor where my support was immediately removed.  I wasn't able to sit and cry and hold my husband before he was whisked away to verify my story. 

When we were done he said he needed to collect my clothing, which obviously is what he needed to do.  We asked him to please park down the street because we have family visiting right now and I really don't want to have to explain to my sister in law and nieces and mother and father in law why the police are in our driveway.  He didn't.  He parked at the foot of our driveway, where my father in law immediately saw and came to ask what was up.  My husband thankfully was able to make something up and I hid in my bedroom for the rest of the day.

On Monday I went to Planned Parenthood for STI testing and to get resources for counseling.  I have nothing but good things to say about PP, and I will absolutely always support them 100%.  But the visit and the exam were horrific to me, no fault of theirs.

My husband was unable to stay with me because he had to watch our toddler son, who absolutely did not need to be there.  I was there alone, and since I came in as a walk in, I had to wait... a pretty long time.

I have PTSD from my son's very traumatic birth, and my last pap smear and IUD insertion had to be done under sedation/anesthesia because I had panic attacks any time someone came near my vagina in a medical setting.  I knew this was going to be horrific going in.  This is why I wanted Planned Parenthood rather than the hospital, since I knew that PP would take my feelings into consideration and they have training on how to deal with sexual assault, which I honestly am not willing to trust my local hospital to have.

I was given an exam and pre-emptively treated for gonorrea/chlamydia/trichonamisis via pills and an injection, as well as given the ELLA emergency contraceptive.  I was also treated for a yeast infection and examined for damage to my vagina and cervix, and to make sure my IUD had not been dislodged.  The doctor was unable to tell that because of the swelling and inflammation from my attack and the yeast infection.  I am to return to the clinic in 30 days to retest for STIs, get the first of many HIV pricks, and another exam to make sure my IUD is in place.

Today, Tuesday, my husband and I had a concert planned.  We'd bought the tickets months ago and I was so angry that some horrible fucking scum of the earth pieces of shit were going to make me derail my life because they were awful people, so, we decided that we were still going to go.  We had a good time and for awhile I was able to stop thinking about what happened to me.

We got home, and the cat got out.  My husband asked me to leave the side door cracked so he could get in.  I can't.  And now I'm thinking about all this again and I just don't know how I am going to deal with this.  I am so angry that I'm afraid.  I'm so angry that I had to go through a police interrogation, a vaginal exam, a huge dose of hormones (I got the copper IUD because I am suicidal on hormonal birth control), a giant dose of amazingly strong anti-biotics, and, now, the fear of HIV for the next year.  I can't have sex with my husband.  I physically cringed and pushed away my mother in law when she tried to hug me.  I have no patience with my son because I'm just SO ANGRY.

And now I'm worried about the stupid adorable cat who I don't want to get eaten by coyotes.

This was good to get out.  I know it's long, but thank you for reading.  

Edit: Thank you all so much for the support.  It has been really helpful and I really, really appreciate it.  I can't reply to every comment, but again, just thank you so much.

And for the few people that decided to send me hateful PMs, I'm so sorry that your life is so unfulfilling that you feel the need to do that.  I hope you look back in a few years and feel ashamed.

Also, I understand why the officer who took my report asked me so many questions, and I understand that he needed me to repeat myself.  Body language and tone are incredibly important and can change the meaning of things intensely.  I got an officer that was unable to even attempt to be kind or sympathetic, which could have changed our encounter completely.  I don't have any problems with police.  I have had many positive, and a few negative encounters with them over the years, and I understand they are just doing their best, but, at this particular juncture, this officers best was not good enough or helpful to the situation.  I also understand that he needed to talk to my husband.  I think that having someone sit with me while my husband was taken away to talk would have been very helpful, but, I was left all alone after a very intensely humiliating experience and it just made the experience even worse.

But again, I understand and I don't regret going to the police.  I just wish it would have been an easier, more compassionate experience. ",TwoXChromosomes,2604,1469613371.0,430,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4utupn/i_was_raped_on_thursday_and_need_to_talk_about/
"Misdiagnosed, belittled and ignored. Now I'm suffering the consequences","When I hit puberty, everything hurt. My bone were in crippling pain, I couldn't walk from the leg pain and my body changed so rapidly my everything was swollen. The doctor said it was normal growth pains and just gave me painkillers. I suffered for over a week before the fluid bubbles behind my knee finally drained enough for me to walk.

I had my first period at 13 and the pain was so intense I was vomiting, unable to eat, drink or sleep. They just kept getting worse every month and the bleeding was so heavy that I became iron deficient. The doctor said it was a hormonal imbalance and put me on the contraceptive pill (microginonn 30) to ""regulate"" my periods. I developed night terrors, an eating disorder, crazy mood swings and eventually at 18 years old I developed my first breat lump. Doctors biopsied, it wasn't cancer but needed to be removed. The surgery disfigured my breast and left a large scar. They changed my contraceptive pill (cerazette) to avoid more breast lumps.

I'm 20 and my periods have stopped but so too has all libido and natural ""lubrication"" that occurs during intercourse with my long term boyfriend. Doctor says it's my only option and I should use synthetic lubricant to help. A weak later I'm rushed into hospital with a deep vaginal tear from intercourse. They knock me out with high dose morphine and determine I need stitches. I'm discharged but a week later I'm readmitted with a UTI. They give me antibiotics and discharge me. Two days later I'm rushed to intensive care, I have an infection in my bladder, kidneys and liver. I'm in crippling pain and stay in hospital for two weeks. When I'm discharged they recommend stopping the contraceptive pill to reduce a repeat of this kind of infection.

I'm 21 and I have been suffering with panic attacks and violent night terrors. My doctor says I have a hormonal imbalance and puts me on the ""mini pill"" to regulate my menstral cycle. I suffer constant overstimulation, anxiety and panic attacks at work. I am left on long term sick. My doctor says I'm ""emotional unstable"" and depressed. He warns me that "" if I continue like this, things will spiral and get worse. No one will want to know me, no one will love me and I wont be able to get a job. I needs to snap out of it"". He prescribed antidepressants (cypralex) and refers me to a psychologist. The phycologist puts me in CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) . I'm diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, given Coping mechanisms and left to handle it alone. Nothing improves so I decide to stop all medication and connect with a councillor. My mood , relationship, eating habits, periods and sleep drastically improve.

I'm 23 and I've been free from synthetic hormone contraception for over a year. I developed a gradual pain each month that feels like period pain but 100000x worse. I see a specialist in February and they tell me that I have a ""chocolate cyst"" in my left ovary and it will need surgery. They schedule the surgery for August of the same year. In that 6 Months the pain rapidly worsens. I got stiff and eventually can no longer stand up straight as somethitis pulling me into a fetal position. Whilst waiting for the surgery I'm giving ibuprofen to ""manage the pain"". When the surgery happens they find the cyst has.grom from a pea size to the size of an orange, wrapped around my fallopian tube and adhered to my bowel. The surgery take 6 hours, it's endometriosis and in removing everything they are forced to take half of my left ovary. They inform me thaty fertility will be extremely limited and that I must have a hormonal birth control IUD to prevent the endometriosis returning. I'm devastated.

I'm 28, my mind is constantly racing, I'm over analytical, struggling with rejection and hyper fixating on many topics of interest. I speak to my doctor and request an ADHD and autism assessment. I'm placed on a waiting list. 
My fiance a lnd I want to try for a baby, we have the IUD removed. I have blood work to test my iodine levels and they're worrying. I see a thyroid specialist who does an ultrasound and discovers I have Hashimotos disease. I'm given thyroxin meds and told I need to take them forever, but nothing more. two weeks later I'm pregnant. . 
The first 7 months of pregnancy is hell, I have extreme morning sickness and cannot hold down food. I'm in and out of hospital for checks and IV fluids. They discover a new cyst growing on my left ovary and blocking my cervix. They're concerned I cannot give birth safely but will ""wait and see"".
My daughter is born early at 37 weeks, the labour is 14 hours long. I have so much damage that ""you'll need cosmetic surgery to fix this"".

5 years go by and my mental state has worsened due to being a first time mum and covid preventing me from seeing my family. I start to notice ADHD and autism traits even more. My night terrors worsen, I'm given antipsychotics (quetapin) to help me sleep. I've been on the waiting list for an ADHD assessment and autism assessment for almost a decade. Eventually I decline enough to be sent to an mental clinic. The lead doctor believes ADHD and autism is a tiktok trend and I'm just depressed. After 6 weeks in the clinic, I'm sent home with a PTSD diagnosis and modern antidepressants. The psychologist from the clinic determines that I am neuro divergent but cannot precisely narrow it down. 

Another year goes by and a male friend from the clinic contacts me to tell me he was told he might have autism whilst in the clinic and his doctor referred him to a colleague who just diagnosed him with autism. I ask for this doctor's number. A month later I'm assessed and diagnosed as autistic. The same level and severity as my brother who was diagnosed as a child and has never worked a day in his life due to being told he is unfit to work by rh social support team. At this point in I'm my late 30's 

I see a female psychiatrist who explains that based on my symptoms she believes I'm audhd and prescribed me ADHD meds (Elvanse). My crippling anxiety and chronic overthinking, instantly vanish. I feel so much better. I ween off of my ""modern antidepressants"" and I continue to improve. I have a lot more clarity and begin to look forward to things.

4 months go by and my life has vastly improved. Yet my heart rate is continuing to be dangerously high. Never dropping below 90 and constantly in 130-150 range most of the day. Also, my joints hurt every morning and whenever I stand from crouching or sitting on the floor, I have a sharp pain in my head that radiates down the side of my face and jaw. The doctor does blood work and a heart monitor rest for 24hrs. The blood work is fine but they confirm the heart rate is high but ""they aren't too concerned"" and so nothing further happens. 2 months later and my joint pain has worsened and my weight loss is drastic. I push the doctor for more investigation into the cause of the heart rate, head pain and joint pain. They run more blood work and again it's normal. The doctor believes that it could be my bones weakened from the prolonged use of thyroid medication and Quintapin. I'm now waiting on an orthopedic specialist appointment.


All through my life I've been treated like a hormonal little girl and doctors either dismiss me of take the easy way out with generalised hormonal medication. Now, as I approach 40, the reality is I have multiple genetic conditions that have been ignored and misdiagnosed. Consequently I'm now facing damage and pain long term, all because doctors assumed everything was to do with my menstral cycle or hormones. Only after I argued and pushed did any investigations take place which finally identified the causes and not the symptoms.

How to deal with catcalling,"This happened a couple of years ago, but it was so remarkably effective I thought I’d share. I have used this method several times since and it always has the desired effect.I was walking along minding my own business when some guy hanging outside a CVS said something to the effect of “Hey honey, why don’t you come over here and give me a kiss?” The sidewalk was rather wide, so he was several feet away from me. I stepped towards him and started screaming as loud as I possibly could. After several seconds, he called me a ”Crazy bitch.” I continued to scream. The street wasn’t super busy, but there were other people around who were now looking in my direction wondering what was happening. A couple more seconds went by, and the guy started to walk away. So I followed him, still screaming (I did have to stop for a couple of seconds to inhale). When he got to the street corner, he turned around and shouted “Get away from me, you crazy bitch!” And took off running.We all know that the purpose of catcalling is to make women feel uncomfortable, so why not turn things around?

"""What kind of attitude is that?!""","It's currently 1:25 am where I live. I started my period early and realized I have no tampons. So, I grab my pepper spray and start toward the nearest plaid pantry, about ten minute walk from my place. 

As I walk, some dude pulls into the parking lot and drives slowly beside me, trying to get my attention (""hey, baby."" ""What you doing cutie"" ""Wanna party?"") I ignore him and continue walking, pepper spray at the ready. He pulls forward and parks. Gets out of his car. I cross the street. He gets back in his car and pulls into the street, but can't get near me as I was facing onward traffic. He stops in the middle of the fucking street and *shouts* at me from his car. So, I tell him to fuck off. He gets mad and shouts ""Fucking bitch. What kind of attitude is that?!"" And finally drives off. 


Um. That's the attitude of a freaked out person that you are trying to approach in the middle of the night repeated after they clearly show they don't want to talk to you. In what world is that appropriate behavior? When has that ever worked for you? Do you just get off on scared women and were angry I wasn't scared of you? 


Well, fuck off and learn how to interact with people.


Edit: Many people seem to believe if I had politely told him no, the situation wouldn't have happened. No, that is not how it works. I am not threatening my safety to be ""polite"" to a man who is stalking me.

Many people also have stated he probably thought I was a hooker. Well, he didn't. Most hookers don't actively avoid potential money or dress the way I did.


I do not live in the Ghetto. This is not a race issue. Not that it matters, but this guy was a white dude in a nicer, newer minivan. Dude was most likely solid middle class. Once again, this is not a race or a financial issue, it's an entitlement and respect issue.


Also, I was not being serious when asking ""does that ever work for you?"" It doesn't, and they don't care. It's a power issue. They're getting what they want when women are frightened and uncomfortable. I was venting about a common issue on a women's site.  

I reacted correctly, speaking as someone who experiences harassment on a regular basis.

Didn't expect this to blow up!

And stop giving me suggestions on how to handle harassment. I've experienced street harassment since I was 12 years old. No, it does not happen every day, but it does happen.

I had a Medical Abortion. Thankyou to all the women who helped guide me," Weeks ago, I came to reddit to find advice and reliable first hand experience about how to go about the difficult topic of abortion. I found some very good information dating back years on the steps to take and what having an abortion was going to be like. This is partly for my own benefit to process events, but more to guide anyone else who is going through the same things that I did and is struggling to come to the decisions I have made. 
 This is going to be a long one, so I'll try to format if you want to skip to the important parts

 
Background: 
  I'm self employed in my mid twenties. I've had a LDR for the past three years with a guy from another country (yay for reddit) and hadn't had sex in atleast 5 years. It was a bit of a sudden visit from him for a two month stay. I hadn't been on any form of birth control in years. My family on both sides hasn't had a very fertile history, and I had had a miscarriage as a teenager that convinced me I wasnt likely to get pregnant. In hindsight, I was a moron.  I've always been very aware of my cycle through my emotions, and the boyfriend was set to arrive a few days before my period.  
 He arrived and my time of the month came early, ruining my first sexual interaction in 5 years. Just my luck. So for the first five days of his visit, I was curled in a ball having an abnormally painful period. He was great about it. The next weekend was when we had my first enjoyable sexual experiences, and then my last truely enjoyable to date at the end of the weekend. 

  The pregnancy: 
 It didn't make sense until my ultrasound. The dates and emotions all lined up perfectly in my mind the moment the lady confirmed that weekend was the date of conception. Monday and Tuesday was hell for me. I have always been in touch with my hormones and generally a happy person though always stressed. I've had my down times, but I felt like killing myself. For those two days there was nothing to the world. I have never felt that before, and hope to never again. It got better for a few days, until I got the news that my business was shut down. I was the only supplier in my area left to the only distributor within hundreds of miles of a specialty product. My world for the past 5 years had been building that business, and I never even thought that they would cut me. It wrecked me completely. 
 The next few weeks I just assumed the depression and my hormones were taking a huge toll on my body. My breasts were really sensitive. Any time I got aroused I was cramping in agony. Sex was just painful no matter how shallow or gentle he was. I could barely sleep. I had no sex drive and just wanted to be left alone. The Bf was amazing through all of it though.
  I didn't suspect pregnancy at all until at 3 weeks I woke up after two hours of sleep. My insides were all being squeezed. It felt like I had something that wanted to come out of all 4 holes and I couldn't figure out if I should aim towards or away from the toilet first. I was shaking and light headed and had sweat pouring out of me for nearly an hour. I guess that's what my morning sickness feels like. 

 I was panicking. My life has already had enough problems. I'm broke and broken. I've been drinking and smoking heavily. The father is in this country temporarily. I have people scouting me out to move for a new job. A child, let alone being a single mother isn't in the plans for my high strung self. This explains the pain I've been going through. If it's this bad this soon in, how much pain and discomfort would I be having further along? I knew what needed to happen. He did too.    
 After quickly looking at the price of my options, out of desperation I took a drug that is known to induce a period, that has induced me before. I wont name it, because it didn't work and the side effects of puking, diarrhea, cramps, and panic attack wasnt worth it. I've had bad judgement till now, and rather than trying it again to see if it might work...I looked at my options again.  At this point, he was leaving in a week. I was terribly sensitive to smell and honestly couldn't be in the same room with him or another person without gagging at the smells or foods that normally wouldn't bother me. I was having heavy cramps nearly on the hour every day. My quality of life was terrible, but I didn't want to go through the abortion while he was still here. I just wanted to enjoy my time with him for as long as I could. 

Planned Parenthood: Before the Appointment 

 I don't have much money to spare with the uncertainty of a career. I don't have medical insurance that's worth what I pay. The advice I found online was to go to your doctor ( which I don't actually have a GP) to get a referral to an OB... which sounded pricey and uncertain or go directly to Planned Parenthood.  The closest clinic is nearly two hours away. I called and said I'd like to book an appointment for an abortion. I asked for a Medical Abortion rather than Surgical. This was so I could drive myself without asking my father. He knew and supported my decision, but I didn't want to bother him.  Also, I've had a miscarriage long ago and I wanted this to be a private moment for me. She told me the pricing on the phone of about seven hundred dollars and they would only take cash or card. She said Protesters are common, just dont interact with them. Security wont let them into the building.  The appointment was less than a week away. I got there in time for my appointment to pay upfront and fill out consent forms, but had to wait atleast another hour until they finally called me back. 

Planned Parenthood: At the Clinic

 ""What is your full name? What is your birthdate?  Alright hunny. We have you scheduled for a medical abortion, is that correct? Okay. I'm going to have you step into the bathroom. Urine goes in the cup, and stick this long cotton swab inside your vagina and swirl it along the sides. I'll be in the next room when you're done.""
 In the next room,  I was asked to take off my pants and get on the table. The ultrasound stick thingy went in me and I saw the baby. I won't lie, I had hormones all telling me how precious it was and the wonder of it growing in me. But I also knew at this time in life, I needed to put myself first and the baby wouldn't be growing up in an ideal environment for everyone involved. More than anything, environment is the reason I could not keep my little one. It was estimated at 7 weeks, one day. With a buffer of two days on either side. We've got the pictures. 20 minutes total. It's time for step two of the process. 

 I was sent with a packet of birth control information and a picture to the education office. A girl came in and asked questions regarding my safety, if I was making this decision on my own, and if it really is the right decision for me. She was supportive of my breakdown and let me know about services offered for this type of situation.  I got my blood taken to determine if I was anemic, and educated on how to take the pills, what to expect, and how to identify and react if something is going very wrong. Any questions at all: Call. I was then given an antibiotic to take that night, Misoprostol, and Ibuprofen.  40 minutes in there. Time for the Doctor. 

 I waited for 20 minutes in her office gagging from the smell of their lunch. I just wanted out of there. She came in and asked me to recite how to take all of the pills. She gave me a prescription to fill for Tylenol Codeine and told me to take Mifeprostone pill in front of her. Out I went with plans to take the Misoprostol the next night. 

The day of the Abortion: Mifeprostone

I had things to do. I wanted to make sure I could be out of action for a solid two days just in case. That morning I pushed myself hard. At 1pm, the Mifeprostone started to work better than intended. It was just supposed to stop growth of the fetus. Instead, I was cramping and squeezing out clots every time I bent over. I was not ready for this to happen yet. I scheduled it for 5pm that night.  I wasn't sure if this was right, but decided not to call like they said to and just to take the Misoprostol as instructed.  I had food earlier in the day since I was warned I may throw up and wouldn't have an appetite.  I set out an old comforter on the bed. A trash can with plastic bags, and got comfortable.  I took the tylenol. I went to play a video game as I placed the Misoprostol in the back of my lower gums and cheek.  

Misoprostol: 
 Twenty minutes past and I hate the feeling of chalk. I swallowed early out of disgust. Then frantically googled to see if I just fucked up by swallowing early, even though the first pill was already causing me to abort. Within ten minutes I felt nauseous and light headed, with the cramps from the Mifepristone causing me pain, but I was prepared that there was more to come
  I laid down in bed. It's now about 6:30 as the process is starting. Most of the internet people say the worst will be from the 2-7 hour mark. An hour went by of moderate pain while I was running out of the room to the bathroom. I wasnt filling the pads squirting out blood, although twice it was running down my leg. My abdomen felt like it was on fire as I had convulsions of blood and large clots being forced out of me, but the entrance kept getting blocked and uncomfortable. So I would go squat on the toilet and hear the clots pour out. A few times I missed the bowl as it rushed out whenever I slightly bent over. I checked as many clots as I could to find anything identifiable. 
 At around 10pm, the pain was uncomfortable but felt like it was slowing. I had the boyfriend on the phone and asked him to just be with me for a while. I was crying constantly from emotional and physical pain. I wanted to take a shower because I felt so disgusting and it just seemed like a good idea to have hot water on me. The shower had the hottest water possible as I was bending over with it on my lower back for a long time. It lessened the cramps. Suddenly the pain hit me hard. And it just kept getting worse, and worse, then completely unbearable and light headed and dizzy. I started to panic that I would pass out, bloody and naked in the shower. It was likely that the person to find me is the one person who I hope never finds out that I did this. I needed to get out of the shower right now.  I stumbled soaking wet out of the shower and fell into bed with only a towel underneath me. That's my last memory before I passed out from the pain. 


 Nearly three hours later I woke up freezing, naked, with a towel covered in blood. I'm fairly sure that I should have called as I know what was covering the towel was more than soaking through four pads in two hours. I didn't. Why? I knew I was me again. I woke up feeling like the fog of hormones had cleared. I didn't feel depressed. From the past 2 months of pain, I had a realization that hormones made me not handle it nearly as well as I could have. For the first time in 7 weeks... I felt like me again.  I have never been so relieved in my life. I was still in pain. I was still bleeding. I looked through the clots and was very disappointed. When I had my miscarriage as a teenager I saw it, although my first was much further along than 7 weeks, (and admittedly less painful than this was) I regret that I didn't get to really see my little one to mourn how I wanted to. I have the picture. But touch was wanted more. 
 
I continued to be in pain for another few hours, but managed to find some food and function, then go to bed. For the next week I couldn't lift anything or bend over without feeling blood squirt out of me. It was still painful for days. It took a week of light bleeding and some mucously, kinda smelly discharge to come out. A day of nothing, and then bright red blood coming out which scared me. I did a quick search and found that it can be something like new cells in the uterus shedding, so I didn't call the clinic, once again. I'm not phone shy, I just didn't want to be a bother.

 The follow up 

 For Planned Parenthood, the abortion services and follow ups or complications that can be treated by the clinic are all included in the upfront price. I had an ultrasound scheduled for two weeks after the initial appointment to check to see of any tissue needs cleared out. I typed the majority of this as I waited in the clinic. I stopped bleeding completely after 11 days. The ultrasound showed clear of all tissue. 


 I have never needed to use PP before, but I'm so thankful that I did everything how I did it. I'm even more thankful to the rest of the women who have posted online, guiding me through their private and painful experience to make me feel informed of what the experience was going to be like, and comforted by those who have done it before me.",TwoXChromosomes,4784,1577988586.0,165,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ej1r8t/i_had_a_medical_abortion_thankyou_to_all_the/
I’ve been stalked by the same creep for 8 years and I have no way to make it stop,"This is going to be one of those non-feel good posts where I vent about being powerless in an absolute shituation. 

I(F29) have been stalked by the same man(M47?) for about 8 years now. All of it is done via email these days. It started when I was about 21 and we worked at the same place. My job was to answer phones at that place and one day he started using his lunch break to sit in a parking lot across the street and call the phone of our business literally every five seconds for the whole hour he was out there. Twice he sent flowers to my job for me, but used my email address to send them. I tried calling flower place and they said they couldn’t tell me the name on the credit card. Several times after work, I would be sitting in traffic to see that he was following me. He lived in the complete opposite direction and would follow me and try to make eye contact before turning off the road and leaving. After a few months of unsuccessful interventions by my employer, I quit. After that, the emails started. At first, they came from his personal email. Then, he started making new emails. All of the emails had the year he was born in them, like his personal email. I think he did that so I would know it was him. I have been getting these emails for years. Sometimes they are angry (but not violent?). Sometimes they aren’t. One time he emailed asking if I would spend the night with him for $1000. I was young, alone, and lived in the city and eventually I just never felt safe in that city so I moved. Far. I made myself un-googleable and got rid of/privatized all of my social media. I moved to texas after graduating from college and became a teacher. 
The emails are still coming. A few months ago he made a linkedin profile for ME using MY work email. I only found out because I got the notification and a separate email from him basically letting me know that he knows where I work and live. I just got another one that says he is visiting my city soon and he can’t wait to see me. 

What can I do with all of this information to help myself? I have the emails saved. I went to the police back when everything first started happening and was told basically there was nothing I could do. The detective I spoke with said that stalking laws are built around domestic abuse laws, and since we were never in a relationship there wasn’t anything I could do unless this guy actually threatened or hurt me. I don’t want either of those things to ever happen and I have lived my life for the last eight years being scared and reminded that it could. Just posted on r/legaladvice and was pretty much told them same thing. I just hate this whole thing. Inaction feels unsafe. Action feels unsafe. I feel unsafe.",TwoXChromosomes,1470,1676914088.0,228,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/117etbz/ive_been_stalked_by_the_same_creep_for_8_years/
"If my ex had gotten his way, I'd be sharing a twin size bed with him, living in his mom's house, working at the local grocery store in a rural little town","Ten years ago this year, I was selected for a residential internship-like program. I had to move across the country for it. The program was a year long and immediately followed my college graduation. As a 21 year old, I was excited for the new adventure.

The day I found out I was accepted, I told my boyfriend at the time, Sean.

""You're not going to do it, right?"" He asked. 

He didn't want me to leave him. And while the thought of being long distance sucked, I wanted the experience. I told him that I would be doing the program and that I would help come up with a plan for our shared apartment. 

Every day between learning about the program and leaving for it, Sean grumbled to me. Why didn't I stay local and look for a job around our college town? Sean had a couple of more semesters left in his grad program so he couldn't move with me. I thought about what it would mean to turn down the program. It would mean missing out on cool travel opportunities and work experience that I wouldn't get if I stayed in College Town, USA. I told Sean that I loved him a lot but I needed to do this. 

I had reasons to believe that Sean would still be living in our apartment when my program ended. He told me there were a few organizations that recruited heavily from his grad program and he felt certain he could get a job with one of them after graduation. I left all of our shared furniture and kitchen stuff in our apartment and packed up my personal items like clothes with me. My program paid for my housing and food and Sean decided that he could pay for our one bedroom by himself. 

The program was challenging and at times not very fun. On video calls with Sean, he reminded me that I should have just stayed with him in our college town.

The year progressed. Sean finished his program but couldn't find a job in town. The lease of our apartment ended and he decided to pack everything up and move back to his mom's house. She lived two hours away in an area so rural that the house didn't even have a provider for internet. 

""Don't worry,"" Sean told me. ""There's room for you here. And I have a Hotspot. It's not great for streaming. But you could do job applications and check emails."" 

It was nice that Sean told me that. My own mother told me that she rented out my childhood bedroom and that there was no room for me at her place. 

Sean got a part time job at a grocery store. He told me that he was looking far and wide for a full time professional job and we could move together wherever that was. 

As my program started to come to an end, I also started my own job search. And it wasn't long before I found a full time professional job in my degree area. The experience I had gained in my internship had paid off! But the job was about 500 miles from where Sean lived with his mom in an unknown town. 

When I told Sean, I thought he would be happy for me. The New Town was unfamiliar to both of us but it looked like it had plenty of opportunities for Sean.

""You're not going to take it, right?"" Sean asked when I told him. 

""Actually,"" I said. ""I am.""

I explained how I didn't want to live at his mom's house. Sean slept in a twin size bed in a room hardly bigger than a closet. I imagined trying to make that work with the two of us.

""Well,"" Sean replied. ""You can take the job. But I'm not moving with you. And I'm not doing long distance."" 

I felt devastated. But I imagined what it would feel like to turn down a job doing what I went to school for only to sit unemployed at my boyfriend's mom's house all day. The house was small. It had one bathroom. I had to walk through my boyfriend's mom's bedroom to access the kitchen. I felt grateful that it was even an option because otherwise, I might have faced homelessness. But if I had any other choice, I would not be moving there.

""Okay,"" I told Sean. ""I'll think about it.""

Later that day, I signed my acceptance paperwork for the job. 

Sean was irate. 

""You didn't even talk to me about this first,"" he hissed. I had. He had given me his ultimatum. I understood perfectly. 

With my offer letter, I was able to sign for a one bedroom apartment at a brand new complex, one with a giant pool in the middle and a gym. It was an entrance to the middle class that felt too good to be true. Sean and I both hadn't grown up without a lot of money. Actually, that was an understatement. Sean had grown up in abject poverty.  

I told Sean that he didn't have to move but if he could help me bring my stuff to my new place, I'd be appreciative. He agreed.

""Woah, this place is very nice,"" Sean commented when he saw it.

He decided to stay and I felt so happy. I felt so alone in this new town and Sean felt like warmth and home, even with the ugly ultimatum he had given me. 

Within a month, Sean found a job in his degree field in New Town. 

And I wish this was the end of the story. That Sean apologized to me for discouraging me from doing the internship program or taking the job. That he told me that my hard work had paid off. 

No. Instead, Sean complained to me and constantly compared New Town to College Town. In College Town, we lived in a bar district and could walk to go get a drink. In New Town, we had to drive to get to a bar. Sean hated that we had to limit ourselves so that we could drive home. On Saturday nights, he reminded me that in College Town, we would be at a house party. 

Sean missed College Town so much that I suggested we both look for jobs there. With some more work experience,  we might be better candidates than when we were fresh from school. I found a job first and told Sean that if he would like to break the lease and move with me, I'd make enough to support both of us while he looked for a job. Sean told me that he didn't want to be my dependent and that he would prefer to stay in our current place in the town he hated rather than be unemployed. 

Of course, I understood this. I was just glad that he didn't insist I give up my job opportunity back in College Town. 

It took Sean another two months to find a job in College Town. I thought his homecoming would be jubilant. But he was sad and bitter. A lot of our college friends had moved from the area in the two years we had lived in New Town. We also didn't want to live near the university because of the noise and higher crime rate. Instead, we opted to live about 15 minutes away from the students and the bar district that served them. 

Our move back to College Town felt very similar as our move to New Town. We didn't know that many people. Our part of town was unfamiliar. We still weren't going to house parties every Saturday night like we were when we were students. And Sean was even more bitter. 

I'm not sure what actions we could have taken to have made Sean happy. But I know that the two of us fought about the move to New Town often. In fact, six years after the move down and four years after the move back up, we had one more final blowout fight about it. And that was the end of the relationship. I remember Sean's ultimatum. And it feels funny to know that he was sort correct. Taking the job was the beginning of the end of our relationship. Even if the break up took years to brew. It was me that ended it. I couldn't live with his constant resentment anymore. 

And I think often about what would have happened if Sean had gotten his way. Would I be a manager at the grocery store in his mom's rural town sharing a twin size bed?

was just raped by the QB at my highschool and I'm not sure what to do. I'm scared to tell even my best friend because I don't know what he'll think or say.,"I'm really sorry this is so long. This just happened and I know I'm rambling but I really really need advice right now.

There was a group of us hanging out on the beach including my best friend (I'm calling him Jay) and some of the football kids and their QB who we're gonna call Drew for this post. I wasn't drinking much but Drew was pretty shitfaced pretty quickly. Long story short: cops show up, everyone books it in opposite directions, Drew and I end up walking down the street together alone becaue everyone is off hiding or whatever. We're not close friends but I know his house is a few blocks away and I also know he's not gonna make it home if I don't walk him there. We get to his house and he pitches forward on his front steps so I figure I have to walk him inside. I open the door for him and he shoves me inside and nonconsensual shit happens; I'm not gonna elaborate.

Once he got off of me he just rolled over and passed out and I ran outside and I was hyperventilating then I puked and walked straight to the 24hr convenience store and I didn't even think that entire time I don't know how to describe it I just walked. once I got there I bought plan B and then I didn't know what to do so I called Jay. He picked up and was pretty groggy because he's been home and probably asleep for awhile and I asked him to please pick me up and he told me to send him my location. When his car drove up and he got out he was like ""are you alright?"" and I just started crying like fucking losing it and I don't remember much after that just that I collapsed and he picked me up and then next thing I knew I was on his bed and he was handing me a sweatshirt and asking me if I wanted tea or I wanted to tell him what happened.

I then turned into mega bitch and was like ""no, no I dont"" and he kept being like ""are you sure?"" and I was like ""leave me alone"" like I don't know why I was like that. I looked up at him and he looked really hurt. I said I was really sorry and that the last thing I would ever want to do is hurt him because its true. He's my best friend and I would never want to make him feel bad. Next thing I know he's wrapping me in a hug and I jumped back and slapped him away. I didn't even mean to do that it's so hard to explain and he looked at me in absolute shock and I started to cry again and he gave me another hug and we just sat there. we both fell asleep like that and I just woke up and everything came flooding back to me and I could feel this really tight feeling in my chest and throat and I just felt really uncomfortable. I love writing and sometimes writing things out helps me feel better so I'm kinda just lying here and I'm typing on mobile so I'm sorry if there's any mistakes or if I'm rambling it's just hard to organize my thoughts right now. I've been on reddit and seen people get really great advice for financial and personal struggles and all that so I thought maybe as a girl I could post on this sub and get some advice from literally anyone who is willing to help.

Both his parents and my mom are at a wedding tonight and they're staying over at the destination so I'm just at his house. I feel really lost right now. I've never been a jumpy person and I'm never emotional like I *never* cry and I feel awful about the way that I've been treating Jay and I also just feel overall shitty and I have no idea what to do from here. I want with all my heart to tell Jay about Drew but at the same time I don't want anyone to know. Jay and I have been close since 2nd grade and we're the same person in every way and we share everything with each other. But I'm scared about the way that he and everyone else is going to react about this. my dad passed away when I was in 5th grade and from then up until honestly just a couple years ago, all I got was looks of pity and people treating me like I was fragile when I mentioned my dad. That is the *last* thing I want and I know that's what I'll get if I talk about this.

I feel like this is an ok place to talk because I can just share what I'm actually feeling but then I can log off and no one will know. I've never felt more conflicted about anything in my entire life. I'm also pissed at myself that I didn't do anything more to stop him and that it happened at all in the first place like Jesus Christ I know the statistics I should've known not to put myself in that situation. I'm lost right now and just looking for any kind of advice anyone offers.

~~Edit: about the hospital, I'm not an adult so I don't think that I can go and get tested for anything without having the people tell my mom~~ Ok so I just found out that since I'm 16 or over I can go to the ER and not have them call my mom. If I do ever report it I wouldn't want to make really hard for the police so I'm also taking other people's advice and I put my clothes in a bag and I haven't showered yet either. Whenever Jay wakes up I'll probably just ask him to drop me home so I can drive to the ER.

People react differently if a dark skin man vs a light skin man harasses me,"If a black/Latino man harasses me, everyone believes me and those men are disgusting predators.

If a white/Asian man harasses me, everyone thinks I misunderstood and I should have more empathy for them.

I was at a club where my friend works. I told him one of the white male employees was following me into the bathroom. He told me not to worry about it because that guy does it to all of the women. A Latino man walked up to me to hit on me. He wasn't being creepy or scary. He just walked up to me and this same friend BARKED at him like a dog.

My ex white girl friend would only notice a man is creepy if he was black. If the man was asian/white, she had on her blinders. She made excuses for them. They're little babies and babies can't be rapists.

Other women would ask me additional questions if I warned them about a black man. Absolutely nothing when I warn them about an asian/white man. He's never done anything to them so why should they be worried.

The racism is astounding.

Married man groped me under the table,"I'm so fucking frustrated. I went to this party at a restaurant. Maybe 10-15 people. I was sitting across from a newly married couple. They are expecting a child soon and they way they look at each other is so adorable and loving. She is smart and funny and all around a really amazing woman. He seemed thoughtful and kind.

When I sat down, he did look at me in a way kind of made me feel uncomfortable. I tried to ignore it because they really did seem happy together and I wanted to believe that I was being silly. Then I dropped something on the floor under the table. He was sat right across from me. When he saw the item fall, he grinned and said ""don't worry, I got you"". I said thank you and then I suddenly felt his hand on my leg under the table. I jumped and looked to see him holding the item while trying to run his fingers on my bare leg. I love wearing dresses but I deeply regretted wearing one that day. 

Why did he hand it to me under the table? That was so fucking weird. So I spent the rest of the dinner not making eye contact. At one point his wife when to the restroom and he made comments about her weight. Specifically, how you can't tell she's pregnant because of her size. I felt sick to my stomach. I don't know her well but she is obviously a beautiful and amazing woman and this guy is so gross.

At the end of the night I managed to avoid them when we were hugging goodbye. But when they walked out together, his eyes never left me as they walked away. 

What was going through his mind? What is the expectation? Am I supposed to be swoon over a man who treats his wife like that? 

I feel sick to my stomach over it. I'm so angry at him. I feel like I can't say anything to anyone because it wasn't blatant. It could be attributed to a misunderstanding. I feel like I'd sound like a crazy person if I even said anything. 

I'm just going to be sure to check the guest list for any future events and avoid going if that couple will be there. 

I'm a little worried that he might figure out which phone number is mine in the group text. At least I'll have concrete proof of something weird if he attempts to contact me. 

When people wonder why I don't socialize more, this is why. I struggle to just live my life every damn day because of men. It has gotten worse since I have decided to be alone and just do my own thing. It's as if my disinterest has caused the men around me to go rabbid for my attention.

Story time! I chased a creep with a shovel to get him away from me,"To preface, I had no intention of actually physically harming him. I would have had it been necessary, but my primary concern was getting him the hell away from me. I didn't have my phone and needed to pick my daughter up from her grandparents. 

I came home to grab something and had just pulled into my driveway. My street is not the safest, but it's also not the most dangerous, so while I'm typically on guard to an extent, I've gotten fairly comfortable on my own property. It was dark, I was alone and gathering my keys and then suddenly a man came up to my window. I cracked it and asked wtf he was doing on my property, and he just kept asking my name and if he could have a ride. I obviously told him no and to get off my property. 

I'm not sure what came over me; I think my fight response kicked into high gear, which is strange because I typically try to keep a safe distance. I flung open my car door and started acting aggressivel,  and got him to back up enough for me to get to my front door. I again told him to leave, and he kept trying to beckon me over to give him a lighter, but like, fuck that. 

I threw a lighter at him, told him he needed to be gone by the time I came back out, and if I saw him again I wouldn't be so nice. I grabbed what I came home for, and when I reached my front door, I could hear him outside yelling something. All I caught was ""lighter"" and ""bitch"". I was pissed. 

I have a very large and heavy shovel in my enclosed front porch. I grabbed it, walked out, and told him this was his last chance. He saw the shovel and fucking *smirked* as if to say ""you won't"". I was scared because I didn't expect him to call my bluff like that, and then I heard my dad's voice in my head. He told me that if i ever got in a dangerous situation and I knew I'd lose the fight, to act absolutely insane and it may save me.

I hiked the shovel over my shoulder like you would a baseball bat and started running at him full speed, screaming at the top of my lungs that ""you better start running"" ""I'm gonna f*ck you up"" and many other expletives. 

He ran, yelling, ""OH SHIT OH SHIT"" the entire time, and I've never felt better. I'm tired of men trying to intimidate me. I'm tired of them thinking they have that power over me. Not anymore; my shovel is now rated E for everyone.

Still shaking. Texted with Uber ADT safety agent. Should I report this driver?,"*Edit/update:* Hi everybody - thank you for your responses. I have a small update. I had some trouble navigating the app to report, but good news is, the ADT Safety agent's documentation did it for me. Uber support sent me a message referencing my contacting the ADT safety agent, apologizing, refunding the trip, and saying they would ""take appropriate steps to address this incident with your driver."" Highly recommend using that ADT safety feature, it was very helpful for me and just fyi if you ever use it, it looks like it automatically creates a report. I think that's a nice touch, bc if/when you're frazzled afterwards, it makes it easier for you.



I appreciate a lot of these comments. Most are very helpful and kind. That said, I would also appreciate if you could refrain from certain types of comments. Some of these are making me feel pretty bad. Yes, part of the reason why I felt stupid was that maybe I was overreacting, but the other reason why was that I felt silly for not managing to get out earlier and silly for thinking it was an overreaction. And while I'm sure people mean well, some of these comments are making me feel worse about that. Please excuse me if I'm misreading things, but some of them read like I'm an idiot for ever hesitating. That's not very helpful. It was confusing and I was tired and it wasn't totally clear cut in the moment; he's a 4.99 star driver with 5000 rides, it was raining so hard the streets were running like rivers, and there weren't many opportunities to pull over. I got out when I did, and it's reported now, and that's what matters.



Thank you all, and good night.

Hi everybody. This just happened and I'm not really sure what to do next.



I was in an Uber leaving the city. We were about to enter the tunnel to leave the city and he says he's really sorry but something's wrong with his tire, the pressure, and he thinks it's unsafe and doesn't want to risk going on the highway without getting it fixed. I asked him what that meant, like does that mean he has to cancel the ride, and he said no he just has to fix it first and it should be pretty quick. It's also dark and pouring rain (like, biblical rain) and crazy traffic outside. I say ok bc I don't really know what else to do. I do feel a little on edge bc it doesn't feel right, but I'm not sure what to do. So I start frantically looking through the safety features in the app. But I also feel stupid, like maybe my instincts are wrong and it's totally fine and I should just calm down.




But then it takes really long, like we go far enough that we're now closer to the other, uptown tunnel. We pass a gas station and I ask him why he can't just go there to add air to his tires and he says he needs more than that and we need to go to a shop. This feels like a massive red flag to me. I ask him where we're going then, specifically? And he just says some shop and we're really close and it shouldn't take long. I'm starting to get a little freaked out bc while he seemed like a normal guy, it just feels shady. I asked him to pull over and let me out, bc I see a pharmacy. He says the shop and the tunnel are both so close it doesn't make sense for me to get out now bc it'd be a waste of my time and it'd be impossible for me to get another car in this traffic in this rain near the tunnel and it'll just be harder for me, and he apologizes again. Car drives past the pharmacy.



Earlier, I'd opened the safety button in the Uber app and I started texting with an ADT Safety agent. She tells me it's weird and not normal and I should try to get out of the car. She said if a driver has an issue with their car that they need fixed, they're supposed to end the trip and then go to get it fixed. Knowing this is the final red flag that freaks me out. She tells me again to try and get out. I see a hotel the next block and I tell him to please drop me off. We argue a bit, and I feel kind of bad bc it was tense. But I was really freaked out at this point. He does pull over and I get out. He drives away and I feel so weird and dramatic for it, but I'm shaking and crying and don't even know why.



The ADT safety agent was super nice, told me she was glad I was out of the car. She said it's really weird and she's never heard of a driver doing that before, and that I should report him, and she sent me a link.



Should I report him? I was seriously freaked out and felt unsafe. And he didn't follow protocol. But what if it's just a misunderstanding? If anything, he probably thinks I was upset bc of wasted time--no! I was upset bc I felt unsafe and it just got shadier and shadier and weirder and weirder. If it's just a misunderstanding and it's an important source of income for him or something, I'd feel pretty guilty causing trouble. But at the same time, he should've done what the ADT safety agent said was protocol and ended the trip to get his car fixed and dropped me off somewhere away from the tunnel entrance mouth so I could safely get another ride. I feel conflicted and am still pretty shaken, so please be kind.",TwoXChromosomes,1110,1722733307.0,149,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ejiyqy/still_shaking_texted_with_uber_adt_safety_agent/
I've had two abortions. I want to inform you of what it is like.,"First of all, I know I am going to receive comments that are hateful toward me posting this information. However, my intention is inform ladies that possibly are in the same situation I was in. Before anyone tells me I was irresponsible, you are wrong. The first time I got pregnant, we were using condoms and we are assuming it tore at some point and we did not realize it...because I was unpleasantly informed I was pregnant. I was on birth control the second time I got pregnant (took the pill same time every single day), and still somehow managed to get pregnant. I realize maybe I've had lots of bad luck in this department or I am a freak of nature, but it can happen to anyone. So, don't be too judgmental. I was once in your shoes.  Karma bit me, hard.


And for the religious folk out there telling me God is telling me something by allowing sperm to travel up and make a baby: I don't know. The thing is, I'm more worried about my current circumstances and personal choice. Let God be mad at me but save yourselves the time and let your God do the judging himself.

Anyway here are the experiences:


**Abortion 1:** When I found out pregnant, I was really scared and most of all confused. I found out at about five weeks. It took me two weeks of confusion, crying, research, and even hate to come to the decision that I would proceed with the abortion. I'm not really going t go into detail as to why I chose it, but it was the best thing I could have done at the time.  I was unfit to be a mother (still am) and my boyfriend struggling making ends meet. 

I went online and read about the abortion pill. I thought it would be easy. Many women posted their experiences and many of those stated the abortion pill was more comfortable. They went on to say that the cramps were only similar to period cramps. That they somehow felt stronger enduring what they did and that the procedure was more private.  Cool. Decision made.

I get to the abortion clinic to be greeted by pro-life protesters telling me how they could help me and my partner. It affected me badly. I went inside and was surrounded by all sorts of different women. I was uneasy and confused. Right before I was set up to get the pill, I said I had changed my mind. I walked out to cry (while protesters were shouting at us) and a mother of a girl said some things that made me feel better about the situation. She told me to talk to my mother and father.  I went home and did exactly that. 

Next week I was back, did the whole wait for three hours thing, and finally saw the doctor. I was given a pill there and one to take home, along with antibiotics. I went home. I felt very nauseous and ended up puking at a Taco Bell.  This pill stopped the pregnancy hormone and essentially ""killed"" the ""baby.""

The second pill was to be taken 24 hours later along with Vicodin. I took the Vicodin first, had a heat pad in hand, and took my second pill.  I felt the cramps come on. They were intense but not too bad. I started to fall asleep and used the heat pad. Not too bad, I thought.

Thirty minutes later, I started to feel the most intense cramps I have ever experienced (I have had two kidney stones, so I am highly tolerant of pain) but this was so much. I got on all fours, vomited several times, and screamed. I started having contractions and my mother had to come over to try to help. I was covered in sweat. This lasted about 1.5 hours until my contractions reached 10-15 seconds apart...I started to bleed heavily and well...the pain subsided.

I bled for five weeks  non-stop. There was also a very unpleasant odor associated with the discharge. Almost a rotting smell. It was horrible.


**Abortion 2:** Found out about five weeks in, again. I was in disbelief and to be frank, numb. I honestly had no connection with this pregnancy like I did with the first. I felt no confusion. I felt no remorse. I felt nothing.  At that point, it became obvious to me I am probably never going to be fit for motherhood. I would be a selfish and bad mother. My lack of emotion made clear to both my partner and I to go for abortion number two.

I opted for the 'surgical' procedure this time. Showed up at the place and had the whole routine thing of counseling, the ultrasound, blood work, and whatnot. Finally get to the room and they had me remove my pants, lie back, and well, have my IV administered. It was 'twilight' sedation, so no general anesthesia. I was very afraid of this but the nurse told me to take a few breaths and a few seconds later...I was out.

I woke up sitting in the recovery area. I don't remember much. It was a real blur. I don't know who carried me. I don't know if I walked there. I then remember being walked to the car. I got home, showered, and passed out for six hours.

Very mild cramps and bleeding afterward. 



Well, I hope this helps at least one person. I'm just leaving this right here for you to decide what is best for you. I honestly hope no one comments about how I helped or whatever. Just do what you need to do and don't let others bring you down. Only you know how you feel. 

Even if I eventually regret what I did, life is about learning from mistakes. I don't feel as if I have made a mistake at any point. I had sex, used protection, and decided what was best for me. I have always and will continue to view good mothers as people I admire. My mother was and is an excellent role model and strong woman.  Even though she did not agree with my choices she loved and will continue to love me. I would have had some huge shoes to fill and well, unfortunately I am not cut out for it.  Good luck to you.

**EDIT**: 

Well, I did not expect the response that I got from this. While some of you have to make yourselves feel better about your lives by messaging me and calling me a whore, slut, or murderer--I just hope the children you accidentally/intentionally have/will have are more intelligent than you are.  For the record, I have only had one partner for five years. I suppose being happy in a relationship and having an active sex life is a bad thing. I do hope  for happiness and fulfillment in your lives. I hope you become more compassionate, thoughtful, and caring individuals. While words do not have much of an impact on me--I hope you realize that maybe one day your words can hurt someone. If you feel good about yourself doing that, I suggest you seek mental help or counseling...for your own sake.

Furthermore, I would also like to encourage for people to see if there are alternatives  to Planned Parenthood. I think Planned Parenthood is great. However, I chose a different clinic because they offered the sedation at the same price and it was much smaller--therefore less people and protestors.  So, please look up alternative clinics and do not be afraid to ask specific questions.

A lot of you seem to be in favor of adoption. I did go into detail as to why that was not the option for me.  So, yes. I have heard of ""adoption"" despite some of you thinking this was some strange word in the English language.  

However, I really just wanted to say that thank you to those that did constructively add to the discussion. I have received a lot of kind comments and heartfelt messages and I wish I could respond to them all. I thank you, men and women, for having also shared your experiences. I hope the best for you. If you are struggling: do not be afraid to reach out. Vent on the internet, go to a counselor, talk to a parent, read other people's stories so you know you aren't alone. 

I hope you all have a wonderful night.

--------------------------------------------

I grew up in almost every area you could find a Marine Corps or Navy base, Honolulu, Philadelphia, San Diego you name it; I've been there for at least a month. When my father was finally deployed to Afghanistan my mother and I moved back to her home town of Hueytown, AL to live with my grandparents. My mom, being a college drop out, worked most nights as a server while my grandmother entertained me. Life was different but for me it was all I knew. My dad eventually returned and retired so I thought my life would be normal but nearly 11 years later I find myself living in a world of constant fear and embarrassment far from the normalcy that most children cherished.

We'll call my mom Joan for anonymity.

Joan had a nasty habit of alcoholism, she drank till she was buzzed nearly every night. When my paternal grandfather would watch me my mother would stay out till 3 or 4 in the morning while he awaited her arrival so he could go home. Joan would arrive smelling like her nights festivities and after changing she would simply tell my grandfather,""You can leave now.""

This behavior never changed, especially after the divorce. Joan would often leave me at home with no food or way to get any when I was only 10, not answering her phone or messaging me for days on end. She would even throw extravagant parties which she told me I was not allowed to attend. I would be forced upstairs and not allowed to come down for any reason except to clean her mess or let the dog outside.
As I got older, my mothers antics became more severe. She would tell me I was worthless, that I would never accomplish anything, no one would ever want to marry me and that I would end up on the street. I often ignored the comments, parents sometimes say things they couldn't possibly mean, right? 
The problem with verbal volatility towards anyone is that they develop a fight or flight reaction if you do it enough, similar to being bullied. You either fight for yourself or run, and I chose wrong.
I began fighting back, telling her she never even finished college so who was she to tell me I was a failure? She failed classes in middle school and I was an all A student. The comments turned to screaming, the screaming became frantic and frantic emotions lead to frantic actions. I showed up to school covered in bruises, being a sporty child everyone just assumed it was just a rough soccer game or I fell in dance. My dad ignored them, he told me she was my mother and the comments were just ""who she was.""
I remember when she pushed me down the stairs, she stood above me, *laughing*. Warm tears rolled down my face, it was just who she was.

When I was 12 my dad took me to see a psychologist, we'll call her Anne. Anne was a specialist in child psychology, dealing with children of divorced parents. I saw Anne every 2 weeks for several years, but it wasn't until our 5th session that Anne asked me a question that changed my life forever.
Tears welled in my eyes in horror, even now I can't type the words without feeling them run down my face. Anne asked me if I had ever heard of child abuse or knew what it was.
At that moment I realized, everyone knew *except me*.

I was a victim of abuse and the only one who didn't know it.

Ever since I left her when I was 13 I've had dance teachers,  old friends, ex-friends of my mother and even my own dad tell me they saw how she treated me. But why didn't I? I was so concerned with keeping my life as normal as possible that I ignored every comment, every hit and every lonely night. More importantly, why did everyone ignore it too?
Why did my maternal grandparents gloss over my concerns for her behavior, why did my dad ignore them as well? Why did my own school counselor call Child Services because she thought I was suicidal but never decided to investigate my horrible relationships with female teachers? Or my fear of being touched?

I still don't know... and it haunts me.

Now, nearly 20 years old, my friends call me a survivor of childhood abuse, but I'm not sure if you can call this surviving. Any time a female authority figure yells at me, I have to get up and leave immediately. I burst into tears, which is extremely uncharacteristic of me, I shake and struggle to breathe. I hear the echoes of Joan, telling me to shut up, to stop crying for attention. Sometimes I hear them in my dreams and wake up to my roommate or my boyfriend giving me my medicine to calm me down.
Sometimes I smell her perfume, hear her favorite song or see someone with her poorly permed hair. My heart stops, for a second I'm back in my room, my mother pounding on my door and screaming to let her in, I'm just as scared and useless until a friend asks me what's wrong.

I shake my head, smile and tell a joke.
Because that's all I can do.

Sometimes I hop on Facebook and unblock Joan, see what she's doing. Usually the same thing, going to football games, partying, vacationing with money she doesn't have.
Things my father and I can't afford to do.
I wonder if she regrets anything that happened, I wonder if she even knows what she did.
I'll never know, more importantly I don't want to. But what I do know is this entire ordeal set off a passion in me that no other sport, subject or speech ever has.

Choosing a major in college was easy, I knew I wanted to help people like myself, if at least to help them with the after math. Psychology was my top scoring job on any personality test I took in school but I had already decided it was my calling. I decided I would bring awareness, before I left my High School, I worked to help women and children of domestic abuse, I set up several peer counseling groups as well as a club for people who wanted to help. I educated teachers in my school on the signs of child abuse and how to help children without breaking any laws or stepping on any toes. I left knowing I made that school a bit safer for people like me then when I came.
I hope that I can continue this into a long and healthy career as a Psychologist specializing in PTSD, depression and anxiety disorders while raising my own children in the best possible environment, giving them everything I never had; a real mother who only cares for them, a woman who exerts authority in her tone, not her insults and a parent who uplifts her children rather than dragging them down.

I hope to show people the one of the many faces behind childhood abuse, to make feel them a bit less alone.
Most importantly I hope to be a role model to other girls, and even other women, of the strength behind the suffering and the bright future past the dark present.

Guy sprinted after me in the dark to “just ask a question”,"I was walking home at 5:30, but because of the season it’s already pitch black when I leave work. Close to my apartment, a guy on a bike I’ve seen the past few days asked how I was. So I politely responded, “Good. You?” And kept walking. Then he yelled, “You’re beautiful!”

I picked up my speed, turned the corner and a minute later heard footsteps behind me. I took this opportunity to cross the road because there weren’t any cars. Imagine my surprise when I see the same guy, without his bike (no idea where the hell he ditched it) FULL ON SPRINTING TOWARDS ME DOWN THE SIDEWALK! He was about fifty feet from me so I stopped under a street light, held my hands up and said, “Stop running at me, you’re freaking me out.” 

He said, “I just wanted to ask you a question.”

I responded, “I don’t care, leave me alone, I’m going home.” 

Of course then he did the whole, “Damn, stupid bitch.” 

Thankfully he didn’t follow me. I feel lucky that I found a place to work so close to me, but god do I hate walking in the dark. And for the record, I was wearing mom jeans, a long sleeve shirt, and I was covered in sweat and snot because I’m a preschool teacher. Men will harass you no matter what.

ETA: for the next few days (at least) my mom will be driving me home.

My Parent's Church Tried To Publicly Shame Me For Having An Abortion,"I was 30 years old, teaching, not making a lot of money, paying rent for a TINY home. Had to leave my job when covid started, my school was going to open full-time in September 2020 and with a sick father, I was nervous to take that risk. I found some private tutoring jobs and was just barely surviving the pandemic financially.

December I lost my appetite and figured I wasn't handling my stress well. I deal with depression and anxiety and there were some other things I was going through since September. I wasn't sleeping, I wasn't eating, and it felt like I had a stomach ulcer. Not having insurance, I tried everything to handle my stress and health at home. This lasted until January when I started feeling nauseous and throwing up.

**I hate to admit it but I had NO IDEA I was pregnant.** I was faithfully taking birth control and my SO is a nurse... so we're very educated in that area (haha). I've dealt with ulcers in the past and figured that's what it was. Pregnancy was NOT on my radar at all.

January 20th I checked myself into the ER. I was starting to miss work I desperately needed because I was throwing up - and with COVID still being a new thing families were uncomfortable with me in their house. And I was scared, I didn't know what was going on and everything I was doing wasn't helping and things were getting worse.

A few hours later in the hospital after blood tests and a rehydrating iv the nurses told me **I was 5-6 weeks pregnant.** (I'm in NJ, thankfully not in TEXAS... but that's another issue. Women deserve the choice over their bodies.. .not government or men.) **5-6 weeks and I thought I had an ulcer.**

I WAS FLOORED. shocked. stunned. speechless. I called my SO and my first words were, ""I can't have a baby now, I can't go through with this pregnancy."" They supported my decision.

I panicked and told my parents, and looking back I wish I had never told them. I was going through shock of finding out why I had been so sick these past months, and an abortion was something I never thought I'd have to do. I am pro choice, but I never lived in a way where I was throwing caution to the wind. It was shocking news. I told my parents I was pregnant and I was choosing not to follow through with the pregnancy.

They said that wasn't an option and went to their church (I stopped going to this church 3 years ago) and told the Elders. **6 men, all 40 yrs and above, with wives, and children.** I was locked in fear. I knew what I needed to do, but pressure from my parents, some friends and family, and now the church had me feeling stuck in cement that just kept pouring down on me.

One of the Elders (who has 2 daughters of his own) came to talk to me. Said that there were other options like adoption. I said that I understood that but had no finances, was not in a good state of health mentally or physically to be pregnant, and I did not want to carry to full term, I didn't want to be pregnant, I didn't want a baby, I didn't want adoption and a child growing up wondering why their mom didn't want them. I'm a teacher, I see these stories, hear them from my students, experience them everyday.

They told me to read my bible and remember that even though this is a ""desperately sad"", ""hopeless"" situation, and that ""sometimes god's discipline hurts"", that god works with our sin to show his greatness. I've never felt so unheard in my life. That feeling is crippling. I battled with these pressures, to the point of almost killing myself. I called the clinic crying and told them I needed to come in.

**\*I went. It saved my life. The nurses and staff were amazing and the first care I had felt in weeks. I felt cared for. I felt heard. They were gentle. They let me talk and** ***they listened.*** **They didn't try to pressure me out of it or say what they thought was the best decision for me. I woke up from the procedure and for the first time I felt like I could breathe. I left the clinic, opened the doors and felt sunshine for the first time in weeks. I just cried in my SO arms... but this time it wasn't sadness, or anxiety, or frustration, or anger. It was joy to still be alive. It was a breath of new life, relief. I can't express these feelings strong enough. I woke up and the hundreds of pounds of cement on my chest, heart, and mind were gone and there was the warm sun waiting for me. I will never forget that day.\***

My parents knew about the appointment. (Financial reasons and a few others, I was in the process of moving in) They called the church. In the waiting room at the clinic I received texts from some of them saying that it wasn't to late to change my mind. A few days after the appointment, an elder came to the house, while my parents had friends over for a get-together in the backyard, and told them that they (The Elders) were going to enact church discipline on me by telling the congregation what I had done.

ALSO - because of covid, the church was meeting outside on the side lawn of their property. Every Sunday they set up speakers and a small stage to hold their service, in a small neighborhood. The church sits in the middle of a neighborhood block - 2 sides of that block has apartment buildings directly across the street. the other sides have neighboring houses. ***This means that when they'd be announcing MY PERSONAL and MEDICAL business, they'd be doing it out in public over a microphone and set of stage speakers, IN THE MIDDLE OF A NEIGHBORHOOD.***

Thankfully enough, my parents felt this wasn't the best course of action and asked the Elders to not follow through with this plan, that it was not the way to go, that it would cause more harm, and this was no way to ""bring me back to Jesus"".  **The Elder said he understood and that nothing would be said about the situation, YET DIDN'T RELAY THAT MESSAGE TO THE OTHER ELDERS, which he said was a ""mistake"" on his part.**

At the service that weekend, THAT MY PARENTS DIDN'T ATTEND, they didn't give names but announced that the church was dealing with a difficult situation and needed prayer and support. Some people at the church who knew about the situation texted my parents what happened. My parents felt betrayed that any info was given - which is ironic because *I had asked them multiple times to stop telling people my business and that it was my story to tell, but they didn't understand that. They still don't after all of this sh\*t.*

I stand behind my decision 100%. It was not easy to make, but ALL women should have a choice over their bodies and their lives. It is not up to parents, a husband, a SO, a pastor, elder, or the government. I'm hurt by my parents and some friends and family who don't understand my decision... but it's my decision and I will clap for myself if I have to.

It makes me sad and not trusting of the church - how was that the way to care for someone? These men with their own families and children thinking that airing my hard decision would bring me to church or to Jesus. It hurts my heart that this is what the church did. It hurts my heart that this is what some states in our country are doing.

I will never forget the feeling of shock at finding out I was pregnant.

I will never forget the feeling of betrayal that instead of listening to me, my parents went to the church instead.

I will never forget the feeling of being silenced in what I wanted for my life. Being silenced when I was screaming that I was suffocating. Silenced to the point where I thought of taking my own life.

But...

I will never forget the breath I took after waking up. I will never forget feeling the sunshine as I walked out of the clinic. I'll never forget falling into my SO arms that day and crying with joy that I was alive again. I will never forget the pride I have for choosing myself... not my parents, not the church.

Daygaming: How NOT to approach women,"Daygaming is a ""dating strategy"" in which a man approaches a woman outside of a social setting, often aiming to catch her alone, and force into conversation, with the goal of getting her number.

Right off the bat. This is *not* a dating strategy, it is harassment, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Following a woman to an empty store aisle, to her car, or to a street corner, and making romantic/sexual advances on her is harassment.

Reasons why daygaming is awful:

1. There's a reason why non-social settings aren't social, because in those places, people have shit to do and places to be. Nobody needs their day interrupted someone trying to get in their pants. People go to social settings to be social, and non-social setting to not be social. Why would you ever break that??
2. Following *any* woman *anywhere* for *any* reason without her consent is stalking. Stalking is a crime, and if she notices, she will be not be in the mood to talk to you, that's for fucking sure. Women have been stalked and kidnapped in broad daylight before, and they cannot know your intentions. It's a terrible way to kick off a conversation, and, again, illegal.
3. I cannot think of a single woman who would enjoy being approached by a random guy while alone! Women do not enjoy feeling trapped, whether you're physically cornering them, refusing to cease conversation, or not respecting personal space. Again, there are women who have been kidnapped off the streets, and almost every woman has met a weirdo that definitely would have added to that statistic if given the chance.

A good motto for men dating is this: if you wouldn't want a guy twice your size doing it to you in prison, don't do it to a woman in the street. Women don't know your intentions, or who you are, or what you've done, but most are aware that you could physically overpower them if you wanted, and it's better to be safe than sorry.

Dont buy into any ""alpha"" male's advice! They don't know what they're talking about, and they probably just want your money. 

Women, please, is you know of any man in your life that does this, let them know that it's not okay! The name sounds innocent but it's nothing short of harrasment.

**Edit so people will stop commenting the same shit:** yes, you can talk to someone outside of a social setting. No, asking someone out during the day isn't the same as daygaming.

If you're both naturally in a non-social setting, you talk to her without following her around the store or to her car, and you're open to rejection, then you're not dayming.

""Hello, I just saw you here and thought you looked nice. Would you want to grab a coffee with me sometime?""

""No thank you, I'm not interested. Have a good day.""

""Okay, have a good day.""

That's just interaction. It's quick, lets both people go on with their day, and there's no stalking or harassment involved. As opposed to daygaming, when you go to a non-social place specifically to find someone's number, you follow that person around, follow them until they're alone or cornered, and then you try to get their number until you either get it or they escape. ""Would you want to get a coffee with me sometime,"" isn't the same as

""Lemme get your number""

""No"" 

"" Lemme get your number""

""No""

And let me restate number 2. Clearly some of yall have never been followed bc yall don't know what it means. Just happening to walk in the same direction as someone, or coincidentally ending up in same aisles as someone in a store is not following, and that's not what I mean. Following someone means regardless of where you go, even if you start taking a really weird path, they'll be there, some x distance behind, usually just standing there trying to act like they don't notice you, sometimes staring at you. If you're in a building and you go to the bathroom, they'll wait around for you to come out. Sometimes they'll be x distance in front, too, some PUAs reccomend always being in the line of sight of someone so you can justify your creepy behavior with some eye contact or something. Catching up with someone because they dropped something isn't following, approaching them right after you decide you want to ask them out isn't following.

**Edit 2 cause I forgot to include this in the 1st one:** When I said that following a woman anywhere for any reason is stalking, your laws may vary! Turns out, a lot of state laws vary, and I assume other countries' laws vary too. Lotta states say that stalking has to be a repeated to be considered stalking, so I'm wrong about that stalking thing depending where you live. Is it still rude and creepy? Yes, but not stalking, it turns out. Thank u/RazekDPP for pointing that out to me, bc I was just going by the DOJ definition.",TwoXChromosomes,1453,1622071842.0,300,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/nlugo5/daygaming_how_not_to_approach_women/
That was NOT sweet or romantic,"Can we talk about inappropriate behaviour for a second? This isn’t a ‘not all men’ post. I KNOW not all men do this, I want to know why the men that do, do it. 

I work with a guy who has a wicked crush on me and claims he’s in love with me. I’ve turned him down repeatedly. He’s pushy and doesn’t take a hint, but he’s actually a really good coworker (not sure if that’s because he wants to impress me or he’s actually good idk) so I just turn him down and move on. However, last night after my shift, it’s dark, late and I’m alone in my car leaving work. This car starts following me through town. It met me leaving work so he was waiting for me. He followed me until I left town (I live a town over) and then messaged me and was like ‘I was following you, hahaha’.

...... in WHAT world is that romantic or sweet or harmless? It’s creepy as fuck and as a woman who’s had unfortunate circumstances I was weirded out and super uncomfortable. I know this guy is clueless and doesn’t have a back bone but HOW do you reach that point that doing something like seems okay??? I don’t get it. Can someone please explain how?

Men Trauma-Dumping Doesn't Mean They Care About You.,"This is a reoccurring lesson for me and my girl-friends. Remembering this has saved me from diving in, hopeful and starry-eyed, for a man who actually didn't feel anything for me at all. 

As women, we don't all open up easily. There's the face of pleasantries and light-heartedness that we keep up. We're agreeable and kind to avoid scaring-off new people by being too bare too soon. This is because we aren't automatically granted respect for just existing, it has to be worked-for. I don't have a trust that anyone will care or listen to how I truly feel besides my long-term friends. Women have to constantly prove ourselves 'worthy' to men and other women.

But men only worry about earning respect from other men. They don't feel they have to fight for yours. They don't even notice when they earn it (we do). Men do not have to actually like you to feel comfortable confiding trauma in you. They will do it regardless. They are taught to see us as caretakers. For a lot of women, the emotional intimacy door is wide-open. They may not like you at all, but they’ll use you in place of their male friends for your heart. Because, blatantly, they don't have to worry about embarrassing themselves in front of someone they don't respect.
It’s NOT about you. In that moment, any feelings they have are their own grief, fear, sadness, self-doubt, whatever. NOT love for you, NOT care for you. Remember this. As bleak as it is. Men will not care for you because you are there for them. They will care for you when you abandon them (...and that's a topic for another day).

My friends and I have seen time and time again, heartbreak, because we felt so close to a man. They confided in us, they were honest and heartfelt with us, they bore their soul and begged us to be there for them when they needed someone. And we always were. And we took that to mean we were special. DON'T fall for it, don't run to your girls gushing about the breakthrough you had last night with the man you've only been seeing for 3 months. As fast as things started for them is how fast they can change. Love yourself.

I know, personally, delulu-land is a short walk. Making the trip is often subconscious. But knowing this helps. Being able to say ""I knew it!"" instead of ""But I thought!"" is empowering. And you're always stronger next time &lt;3",TwoXChromosomes,1579,1711936567.0,100,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bsrmkv/men_traumadumping_doesnt_mean_they_care_about_you/
Can we talk about how the Utah Police failed Gabby Petito?,"For those who aren't up to speed, Gabby Petito went on a road trip with her fiance Brian to Utah. During the road trip they argued and a third party observed it and called 911 because they were worried. Police responded and the officer said the two were just ""arguing"", clearly in love and that Gabby seemed to be having ""mental health break"" because she was crying uncontrollably.

Later, a second officer pulled over Brian who was speeding and Brian fails to pull over and eventually swerves and hits a curb.  After the van pulled over, Gabby was crying uncontrollably. The officer suspected that ~~Gabby~~ **Brian** was battered given the discrepancy in her and Brian's story and the scratches on ~~her arms~~ **his face**. The officer split them up over night but didn't file any charges.

**She stayed in the van bc the vehicle is registered to her. In the police cam at time mark 3:38, she talks about how he locked her out of the** [van.](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=218)

**Brian** [explains](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=319) **that she was trying to get her phone and the keys away from him, but he admits to taking the keys from her and telling her ""let's just calm down"" but doesn't explain why she was getting her phone or why he was preventing this. Was she trying to call someone or record what he was doing? If they were both holding the phone and he suddenly let go it could have swung up and hit his face.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Brian admits to speeding and cops glibly** [**ask if Gabby w**](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=364)**as to blame for him speeding as well.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Gabby says he grabbed her** [**face.**](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=540)

&amp;#x200B;

**Cops talk saying the witness saw** [Brian lock her out of the van](https://youtu.be/fCGsW41aQEw?t=1258) **and Gabby tried to climb in through the driver door over Brian to get into the van after Brian hung her things on the back door of the van.**

&amp;#x200B;

Then Gabby went missing in Wyoming. Brian returned to Florida without her driving her van. After her parents filed a missing person report, Brian refused to cooperate with police and got a lawyer.

&amp;#x200B;

As a utah native, I am intimately aware of the DEEP seated misogyny in Utah and how that sexism impacts women, gaslights and neglects them.

I am reminded of Lauren McCluskey was violently murdered by her ex-boyfriend Melvin Rowland at the University of Utah on Oct. 22, 2018. She and her family had expressed concern about Melvin. Lauren reported Melvin was stalking and extorting her with naked photos but police didn't handle the case correctly. The Utah police not only FAILED her but also shared naked photos of her with their coworkers after her death. WHAT THE HOLY HELL. THEY SHARED HER NAKED PHOTOS THAT THEY KEPT STASHED ON THEIR FUCKING PHONE.

&amp;#x200B;

Something needs to be done. UTAH police needs to be defunded, restructured and re-educated. HOW MANY WOMEN NEED TO DIE BEFORE THEY CHANGE?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: Please note no one is saying Gabby didn't lash out violently. She also had hit him several times as well after he threatened to leave her stranded alone in Moab without any resources (her phone and other items were in the van). When he was telling her to walk away it was so he could leave without her. Keep in mind, the van is** **HERS,** **not his. Yet he drove it all the way back to Florida??? Why did he fly home and then fly back to drive the van back?**

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT2: updated with corrected information based on police body cam**

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 3: Here is a screen shot of the police report saying Gabby struck Brian AFTER she thought he was going to abandon her in Moab. 

Per the police report:

&gt;Brian said Gabrielle, thinking he was going to leave her in Moab without a ride went to slap him. As Gabrielle started to swing, Brian pushed her away to avoid the slap. As a result Gabrielle off balance, but still caught Brian’s face with some fingers causing some minor scratches

I surprised my BF with my hyper awareness during our night walk,"So yesterday we went to the movies and because Avatar 2 is so freaking long, we ended up finishing the movie after midnight.

The theater is close to our home, like 20 min walk and because I was with my BF (tall guy ex-rugby player) I felt safe. 

While we were walking, there was a girl in front of us who was taking the same route as us. I noticed how the girl was nervous (always looking ""behind us"", walking faster, etc) so I guided my boyfriend to take a different route. 

My BF was confused and I said: ""that girl with the brown jacket was nervous because of us, let's take this route instead"".

My BF blinked confused and followed up with a: ""wait, there was a girl with a brown jacket in front of us??""

I laughed and kept going our way, then when we needed to cross the street, I noticed a car parked on the other side with the door wide open and a man with a cellphone talking on the driver seat.

I NOPED instantly and guided my boyfriend to take an alternative route and he was once again confused. When I explained the guy in the car thing, he looked back and saw him. 

""Well damn, I didn't even notice,"" he told me impressed, ""are you always this aware on the street?""

""Well I have to"" 

""Why?""

""Because I'm a woman and you never know who's watching you at night"". 

I could tell my boyfriend got worried and told me he was sorry I have to experience this kind of nervousness all the time. I thanked him and then tried to light up the mood saying:

""Don't worry, with you by my side I don't have random guys following me so thank you !""

I think I scared him even more. I know this story is random but it's really telling how out experiences at night differ so much.

Sharing a power move,"To be clear, this is something I witnessed, and will be emulating in the future. Maybe you all will appreciate this.

The other night I was commuting home pretty late in the evening. When I got off the train it was basically me and just a couple other people, and as I walked home I was maybe a half a block behind another lone woman, maybe mid-twenties, on the other side of the street, nobody else around at all. 

I saw she was approaching a group of maybe 5 or 6 loud, boisterous teenagers coming the other way, taking up the entire sidewalk. 
Now this is a big city, so you never know what you're going to encounter with unsupervised teens out late at night. This woman was either going to have to step into the street to avoid the oncoming group or squeeze up against a fence. 

She did neither. As they approached near, she stopped and planted both feet, head up, and waited. 

The teens parted around her like she was a streetlamp and continued on their way, and then so did she. 

I wanted to applaud! It was the most baller move I think I've ever seen. She just silently stood her ground instead of giving up her space. It was powerful. 

I hope this inspires someone else as it did me.

"I went to a soup kitchen because I needed help. A man stared at me the entire time, followed me out, and spit at me. I don’t feel safe going back.","This was only my second time ever visiting a local meal assistance center. It's Masbia of Brooklyn which is such an incredible, amazing concept, and executed so well. I went in because I’m going through a really hard time financially and physically right now as I appeal my full disability denial. I couldn't work anymore after my total hysterectomy, anastrozole, and heart problems. I just needed a hot meal. Just an hour of peace and dignity.

But instead, I noticed a man sitting nearby who stared at me nonstop the entire time I was eating. No blinking, no looking away. Just watching. I tried to ignore it, tried to tell myself I was imagining things, tried to keep my head down and finish my food.

But as soon as I left, I heard someone behind me. It was him. He had followed me out. And he started spitting at me from behind. It was loud and deliberate. He didn’t say anything. Just this constant aggressive spitting sound, getting closer.

I kept walking as fast as I could without running, heart pounding, trying to figure out if I should turn or confront or scream. But I didn’t. I was able to shake him by going to the train station and blending into the evening rush crowd there. I was jumpy and shaky the rest of the way back home.

What terrifies me the most isn’t just what happened — it’s that I now feel like I can’t go back. That one of the very few places I could go for help is no longer safe because a man decided to make it unsafe.

And even worse, I’m scared to tell anyone who runs it. I don’t want to be labeled as a problem. I don’t want to risk being banned or blacklisted or seen as dramatic. I’m just a woman trying to survive right now. And apparently, even that's too much to ask.

Why is it that men can access these same resources — and still make women feel unsafe while doing so? Why are we expected to tolerate this just to eat?

I just needed a meal. That’s all.

A man’s reaction to my walking home at night,"Yesterday, I was walking home at around 1 am. It’s a twenty minute walk and although nothing has ever happened to me during said walk, I’ve unfortunately experienced a fair share of SA to warrant being fairly paranoid and careful. 

For most part, I was completely alone. That is, until I noticed a man behind me at around the half distance mark. I looked back at him a few times to assess the situation and sped up as a precaution - and you know what he did? 

He crossed the street to the other side. He saw how uncomfortable I was and reacted to it. It wasn’t his responsibility to accommodate my fear - but he did so anyway. It’s a small gesture but it meant SO much to me, it meant that I didn’t have to be on high alert for the rest of my journey home and worry about being attacked/followed. 

I know he was probably uncomfortable when he noticed my reaction to him. I mean, he was probably just trying to get home, too. That’s why I’m all the more grateful for how he handled the situation. That is all.",TwoXChromosomes,2223,1663419523.0,123,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xglulz/a_mans_reaction_to_my_walking_home_at_night/
I think someone was trying to kidnap me the other day,"I went to my favorite park to walk for exercise. I've always felt safe there. It's big and open, it has a petting zoo and a playground, and there are always other people there also walking for exercise, walking their dogs, playing with their kids, ect. It's just always had a good vibe until Monday (1/22).   


The area where I walk has the play ground, the petting zoo, and a pavilion with picnic tables, each with their own small parking lots. I was walking in the area between the pavilion and the petting zoo and I noticed a car drive by me going really slow and I could clearly see the man inside staring at me as he drove past. We passed each other and when he got to a spot where the road splits, he turned around and pulled into the entrance to the parking lot by the pavilion and just sat there with his car facing me. He wasn't even in a parking spot, he was literally sitting in the middle of the entrance. I immediately felt like something was up. I veered off to a path that goes closer to the pavilion so I would be further from the street.     


I stood there pretending to look at my phone, but was discreetly watching him for a few minutes and he kept sitting there. After about five minutes of this, I thought, okay, I need to get back to my car because this doesn't feel right. I pulled my pepper spray out of my purse and had it at the ready as I turned back toward my car and after I got a little ways ahead, he pulled out of the parking lot and drove ahead of me, again going really slow, and pulled into the parking lot by the petting zoo with his car straddling three parking spaces so that he was facing the parking lot by the playground where I was parked. I started walking as fast as I could without running at this point because the sidewalk was a bit icy.   


I got back to my car and got in and locked the doors sat there for at least ten minutes, watching him. (In hindsight, I should have just left right then, I know, but now that I was locked in and safer than I was out in the open, I wanted to see what this creep was going to do.)   


He kept sitting there watching me, too, until finally he pulled out and drove past me. I thought he was leaving, but when he got to the far entrance of the parking lot, he pulled in and parked right next to me. Bear in mind that there was only one other car in this lot and there were at least a dozen empty spaces. I cranked my car immediately and I saw him roll down his window and it looked like he was yelling something. I didn't want to stick around and find out what he was saying after he had followed me twice. I threw it in reverse and sped away. As I was pulling around behind his car, he opened his door and started to get out, but quickly got back in his car and started chasing me. I was driving as fast as I safely could on the winding road that led out of the park. I knew not to go straight home and let him see where I lived, but we haven't lived in this city for very long and I didn't know where the police station was (I was trying too hard not to have an accident with this creep chasing me to look up the address on my GPS while I was driving), so when I got to the intersection at the entrance, I turned the opposite direction I would normally take to go home, and he kept following me. I weaved around a couple of cars in front of me to get some distance between us and made a right turn onto a side street and just kept making random turns until I lost him. Then I made my way back home.  


I was absolutely shaking. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. After my boyfriend got home from work and I had had a chance to calm down a bit, we called the police and filed a report. I had had the foresight to snap not one, but two pictures of his license plate, front and back, while he was parked and watching me the first time and after he had moved when I was on my way back to my car.   


I didn't sleep well that night and I didn't leave the apartment the next day. I'm feeling a bit better now, but I can't stop thinking, What was his plan? What was he going to do? Was he out specifically looking for someone to grab, or was he driving through the park and saw me and that's when he decided to start acting creepy? I'm also so upset because that's my favorite park and I love walking there and now I don't feel comfortable going back, at least for a while, because what if he drives through again while I'm there and recognizes me (I'm easy to spot because I have pink hair) and starts acting even more aggressive? I just needed a place to share this and vent because I knew all of you would understand.

This is how you compliment people in public.,"I know, within the feminist community, there is a lot of debate about where's the line to be crossed when it comes to being ""complimented"" by strangers in public or work settings. 


I know a lot feminists that think that no place or time is appropriate to be complimented by a stranger, while I understand this is an opinion and I respect that... I have to disagree. 


While I was grocering shopping this old man between 50-60's walked up to me and said: 


""Excuse me, miss... Sorry to interrupting you, just wanted to say that you look lovely today and I hope you have a wonderful day.""


This caught me pretty off guard and I probably looked very confused. 


He then said: 


""I really hope I didn't disturbed you out or something, it's just that over the years I've learned that we all need to hear at least something nice everyday and I hope this isn't the last nice thing you hear today..."" 


I said: 


""Oh no, thank you so much... Have a great day yourself!""


He nodded and left. 


Now, see... This is how you approach people and tell them something nice! I didn't feel abused nor objectified and he also had a great point, everyone should hear at least one good thing per day because honestly coming from a place where you struggle with self-love, this little old man just made my whole day. 


This is how you do it! You shouldn't shout on the street, you shouldn't whistle nor honk your car... You shouldn't follow someone and intimidate them... You shouldn't say stuff like: ""hey nice butt!"" ""hey nice rack!"" ""hey sexy!"" ""hey have sex with me!"" or something along those lines that are very inappropriate and awkward as fuck. 


Okay, this rant-ish post is over, thank you for reading.




**EDIT:** Woah, front page... Nice. 


**EDIT2:** Not going to answer everyone but I understand that the number one thing people are asking is:

- Would you have reacted the same way if it was a guy your age? **YES**.

- Would you have reacted the same way if it was a ""shaddy looking guy""? **YES**. 

As long as the person was just being polite, then yes. It still would have made my day. 

And no, you don't need to say ""two long phrases"" to be considered polite... A simple, ""Hello, you look nice today!"" is polite as well. 

I hope that clears everything up. 

**EDIT3:** For everyone claiming that what the man said to me was harassment, you're the ones who are fucked up for trivializing something serious as harassment.

**EDIT4:** Some of you guys, jfc, really need to work on your social skills... We are humans, social creatures. 
If you don't want to talk or don't want people coming up to you on the street with just the intention of making conversation with you, then that's fine... When did I say it wasn't? Do you also need some reading comprehension classes? Don't lash on me, I'm just sharing a random act of kindness that happened to me, the fact that most of the people giving me shit for this are women... It's pretty heartbreaking.

UPDATE: Guy sprinted after me in the dark to “just ask a question”,"Hopefully this is the last interaction I ever have with this man. Check post history for context. 

TLDR:

I walk to work. When I get off it’s super dark out. One day coming home, random guy tries to talk to me and I ignore him. He ends up running down the street after me to “just ask a question”. 

So, the UPDATE: 

I’ve gotten my mom to drive me home after work since the incident with Creepy Guy. I’ve been carrying my big umbrella with me in the morning to use as a potential weapon until I can go buy pepper spray. 

Friday morning I’m walking to work when I pass a trailer. Two people are standing on the porch talking, which isn’t unusual. There’s usually random people at this particular house, women and men. I live in the South, so hearing a random “how ya doing?” isn’t uncommon. 

The man on the porch says just that. I barely glanced over, so I had no idea that it was actually Creepy Guy. I said “Good.” and nothing else. 

The woman says something like “stop it, be quiet.” And that’s when I looked up and realized who it was. 

Creepy Guy then says, “I hope you have a good day at work!” Which just set me off. I was already thinking of saying something when he added, “Do you have a boyfriend?” 

I turned around, pointed right at him, and yelled, “I told you last time to leave me alone! You’re making me extremely uncomfortable. Do not ever speak to me again.” 

The woman next to him nodded at me and said, “Good for you.” 

As I kept walking I thought about all the things I wish I had said. How I’m too scared to walk at night now because he was the straw that broke the camels back. How I plan on using my money to buy pepper spray instead of the phone charger I’ve been needing, all because he doesn’t know how to read the fucking room. 

Overall, I recognize my luck that he didn’t turn particularly aggressive or violent either time. And I’m glad that woman was there. I have no idea how they know each other, maybe he lives in the trailer park and they’re neighbors. They didn’t look or act related, but either way I hope that moment slapped some sense into him.",TwoXChromosomes,1738,1705208755.0,90,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/196801w/update_guy_sprinted_after_me_in_the_dark_to_just/
Really strange encounter at the gym,"I (24F) don’t usually feel inclined to post but for some reason this had me pretty rattled and I felt compelled to share it. I was at the gym finishing up my workout when an elderly woman approached me. She didn’t speak English super well but she was talking about needing help setting up her laptop because her kids live far away and the airline lost her old one when she last traveled overseas. I initially felt bad and asked if she had it with her so I could take a look and she said no but that she lived 5 mins away and that I could come over after the gym. I declined but said if she brought her laptop to the gym the next day someone could probably help her. She continued to insist that I help her and that her house would be the best way because she had an office, and asked what time I could go over/when I’m usually at the gym so she could meet me and have me go over. She said a few times “she lived alone so I didn’t need to worry” and “knew someone young like me would be able to help”. I continued to politely decline and she finally walked away but not before asking my age and telling me I was pretty. I ride a motorcycle so my helmet was on the floor next to me while we spoke - she pointed this out as well. I left just a few minutes later and was walking to my bike I noticed a large white van parked near my motorcycle and immediately felt super uneasy. I waited for more people to be around before approaching my bike to leave because at this point it was dark I was thoroughly freaked out. As I was starting up my bike the vans cabin lights turned on as if a door was opened and in a panic I left as fast as I could, neglecting to put on gloves and turn on music like I normally would. I went to the store before I went home, checking to make sure I wasn’t being followed by anyone. I’ve never really had anything like this happen to me but I know there’s a lot of weird schemes behind human trafficking and my gut was screaming at me that something about the entire thing was very off. While it could have all been nothing but a sweet old lady and a weird coincidence with the van I just wanted to post this in a place where others would understand how scary even seemingly innocent exchanges can feel when you know there are people out there with full intention of doing harm. On the off chance this was some form of malicious setup, I remind everyone to please be careful out there, and pay attention even when your first instinct is to be kind to strangers.",TwoXChromosomes,1024,1710993268.0,133,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bjxj1q/really_strange_encounter_at_the_gym/
Always look over your shoulder when you enter your home.,"I want to share a story about something that happened to me because it can happen to any one of us. A few years ago, I got home from work and walked my dog before we settled in for the night. I live in the city, and I’m in a well-lit college apartment, where there are usually many people around at any time of the day. Most of the time, I’ve felt safe here.

Despite that, I am vigilant when it’s dark out. I’ve seen too many serial killer documentaries to be oblivious outside. It wasn’t super late, maybe 8 p.m. When Ohana (my dog) finished her business, we walked back to my apartment. I never left the apartment complex area. When I got close to my door, I saw a man on a bike across the street. He looked like your typical college guy, so I didn’t pay him much attention. He biked off and I walked to my door.

Ohana is a shiba inu, an incredibly smart, loyal, and stubborn breed. They’re small-ish dogs, weighing 20-25 lbs. Ohana sits at about 20lbs. I think this guy saw Ohana and thought she posed no threat. I went to unlock my apartment and Ohana went berserk, snarling, howling, legit trying to yank off of her leash. She is not an aggressive dog and I have never seen her act like this towards a human before or since this incident. She pulled on her leash so hard that it spun me around, a complete 180. The man was standing a few feet behind me, his hands tucked into his jacket pockets, concealing god knows what. He didn’t give me a “Hi, neighbor I just moved in” or “Sorry! I just wanted to know if I could pet your dog”. No, he runs off. 

I don’t know what that man planned on doing, but there was a 0% chance it was good, and my dog saved me from what was going to be a very very serious assault. So please ladies, look behind you before you enter your homes and if you can afford to care for a dog, get one. Mine probably saved my life.",TwoXChromosomes,2459,1699029739.0,67,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17mzafp/always_look_over_your_shoulder_when_you_enter/
Yesterday I told a cat-caller my salary.........,"This one's a doozy. I know it 100% sounds like a made up story but it actually happened. It was strangely satisfying so I hope you get a kick out of it too.

Context: I just spent a little over two months finding a new job. It was my first time ever switching jobs. There were a lot of ups and downs; it was very time consuming and emotionally draining and it was all I thought about. I had a target salary in mind, $45K over my prior role, which was one of many things I obsessed over for these several weeks. Earlier this month, I got and negotiated an offer for my target salary at a startup I'm really excited about! I'm proud of my hard work in the interviewing process and of my negotiation.

Here's the part that sounds fake but isn't!

Yesterday I was walking to the train station wearing my nice luxury sunglasses I bought to reward myself for the new job. Something about these sunglasses makes men rabid; I've been harassed more aggressively than ever.

This 40-something greasy dude was harassing me out his car window, following me down the street, offering a ride/marijuana/etc., no matter how much I ignored him or said ""no thanks."" Then he pulled up ahead and waited for me to walk by, stuck out his head obnoxiously and asked if I wanted a sugar daddy. I said ""no I'm good"" and kept walking. He was like, ""You sure? I could take care of you.""

That PISSED ME OFF. Some other asshole had used that same line last week in a similar situation. ""I cOuLd TaKe CaRe Of YoU"" as if I'm soooo helpless and dependent, when I'd actually just worked so hard to get a great job. Dude was dressed like shit btw and driving some generic car (I don't know cars), also he was a 45-year-old following and offering to smoke out a random woman, none of which screams high earner.

I judged that he wouldn't be able to follow me onto my train in the worst case scenario. I stopped, turned around, and said, ""Yeah? You think you make more than me?"" He got all flustered and said ""maybe..."" I told him I make 180K and he avoided eye contact and said ""I make about that much."" I laughed and was like, ""anyways I'm good!"" and booked it to the train station.

Absolutely ridiculous interaction but also kinda hilarious. He was being so condescending I had to turn it back on him and call his bluff.  I hope I emasculated him a little and that he has too much shame to use that dumbass line now.

I help a woman avoid a creep using a LPT I learned on this sub,"Friday night I was out with friends at a bar. We were sitting near the entrance when I hear some people yelling and looked around. The bartender and a regular patron were pushing a disgruntled guy out the front door. This guy was clearly impaired, high or drunk, and told the bartender he was going to come back and shoot them in the face. I was pretty stunned and I wanted to make sure this guy left the area so I went outside after him and hung around the few people smoking out front.

The guy talked a some shit as he walked away but appeared to be leaving. Maybe a hundred feet from the bar, he approached a woman who had just crossed the street. She didn't see or hear him causing a scene. He stopped her and started talking to her. I couldn't hear what he was saying but she didn't walk away and responded to him a few times so I'm assuming it was casual conversation.

After thirty seconds or so I felt like I should try to give her a way out so I walked over to them. I didn't know this woman at all. When I got to them I said ""Hey, Emily. Are you coming to the bar?""  She was a little confused as I doubt her name is Emily.
She said she wasn't going to the bar.

I responded with, ""Well why don't you hang out for a minute, all your friends are inside.""

That was all she needed to end her conversation with the creepy guy. She said Ok and walked with me toward the bar. She was going to her car, which happened to be right in front of the bar, so when we got to the entrance I told her how the guy was acting before, she said thank you and got in her car and left. 

Tldr; Drunk guy got thrown out of the bar. He proceeded to talk to a woman outside. I made up a fake name and told her that her friends were waiting for us inside. Creepy guy was successful avoided and everyone when home happy.",TwoXChromosomes,2788,1649102784.0,99,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/twbm0t/i_help_a_woman_avoid_a_creep_using_a_lpt_i/
I’m left scared and uneasy after a message from an old classmate,"Someone who I haven’t seen in over 15 years left me a message a few hours ago. The last time he did this was 5 years ago, and it was to tell me that ‘he was in love with me’ and I was the one who got away or some BS. 

I only ever knew him in middle school, I don’t even remember who I was back then or what sort of chaos was happening in my life at the time. But regardless, he doesn’t know me and I don’t know him. I’m a completely different person than I was even 5 years ago when he messaged me, let alone 15 when we actually saw each other in person. 

I tried to explain even a few years back he is being unrealistic, I am not who he thinks i am etc., but as I’m older now, I tried to convey to him in a different way that he is all in his head, in fantasy land, and that while it’s flattering to be a part of his fantasy world, that is not reality and he does not know me and hasn’t known me for quite a while. I tried to explain that he could hate who I am and vice versa, etc.

He sent me back a video of him just staring off in the distance and saying “I don’t know if you know this or not, but you were meant to be my future wife. I don’t know if you need to come to me, or I need to come to you, but something needs to happen,” and then he just stared off into the distance again for 5 more seconds.

I guess the words themselves aren’t super scary or anything, but the entire tone and vibe of the video sent chills down my spine, and I just feel kinda unsafe now.

I'm not sure if I’m being overdramatic or not, but I feel like I need to make sure I don’t walk alone anymore like after work and stuff? I'm almost too scared to block him too, as he knows where I work and I don't want to piss him off or make him try to see me in person? Ugh idk

EDIT: 

Thank you guys so much for your kind words and validations for the feelings I was and am currently going through. I am reading and rereading the advice you have given me very carefully and am trying to take each and every one into consideration before I make my next move. 

I've always been a 'go with your gut' type of person, and I've genuinely never had this type of scared feeling before. I've decided for sure I’m going to talk to the security at my job, as I am inclined to believe they will take this seriously.

So far I was dead set on not replying and blocking him by the end of the night, but I have read a few things that give me pause. The first being that it will make it easier to get a restraining order in the future if I, in plain english state that I want no further contact from him etc. Another few people have mentioned it might be good to keep him unblocked for evidence or even as a warning if he does escalate things. 
I promise I’m not trying to find a reason or excuse not to block him, as that is probably what will end up happening anyways, but some of those points do seem valid to me as well. 

It breaks my heart to hear others have or are currently going through this as well. I hope you guys stay safe, and thank you again for the different recommendations for defensive tools and The Birdie Alarm.",TwoXChromosomes,1350,1719774100.0,82,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ds8rvb/im_left_scared_and_uneasy_after_a_message_from_an/
Worst sex of my life trying to be a wingman for my friend,"This might be long but I really just have to get this off my chest. 

I’m currently studying abroad in Czech Republic and for the Thanksgiving holiday I decided to meet a college friend who is studying abroad in Italy. We met through the sorority we joined three years ago, and have been friends ever since. She’s a good friend, one of the handful of girls in the sorority that I actually enjoy. However, she’s always been a little selfish. For lack of a better word, she’s a little dumb, so I excuse her selfishness because of that. This time, though, I’m really hurt by it. 

My first night visiting we went to a bar and we starting making out with this pair of brothers. My dude was kinda cute in my opinion, but her’s was the cuter one. I was fine just making out with him, but I didn’t want to sleep with him. 

He walked me back to her apartment, and her and his brother were a little behind us. We kept making out and touching, but I was ready to go to bed. My friend and her man catch up to us at the door of the apartment and I tell her I’m tired. “You don’t wanna go back with him?” She said to me. I felt so awkward because he was standing right in front of me, so I just kept saying I was tired. She obviously wanted to bring her man back up to her apartment, kept ignoring the fact that I wasn’t really feeling like going back to the brother’s apartment, and just said “don’t worry, he’ll wake you up in the morning.”  So I went. 

At this point I’m like fine, I haven’t had sex in a while and he was attractive to me, so I guess I’ll have it. We get back to his apartment, smoke a joint, make out, and he pulls his pants down and it’s literally a micropenis. Maybe like 2-3 inches. I’m immediately turned off, but now I feel stuck. He puts a condom on, trying to tell me what to do and be hot, but I was so turned off. I didn’t feel safe to say no because it was his apartment and he was way too excited. The condom was huge on him, and while I was laying on my back, he had to let me know that it was inside. At one point he slipped out and literally started humping the crease between my thigh and my gut, thinking he was in me. I laid there miserable, and so I said how I was tired, hinting that I didn’t want to keep going. He looked me in the eyes and said “are you lying to me?” I was terrified. No.. no I said. He got up off me aggressively and went pack to finishing the joint. I sat there scared. Let me just act like this is fine I told myself, i genuinely didn’t feel like I could leave. I don’t know why. We had the lamest excuse for sex after that, him forgetting I said I was tired probably on purpose. Again, he was humping my thigh. I didn’t want him inside of me at all so I just sat there and pretending like he was doing the right thing. I practically ran out at 6am when my friend texted and asked when I was coming back. 

Next day, I tell her trying to make light out of it, a funny story, and she laughs of course which I don’t mind because I wanted to laugh about it.   Then, she goes onto tell me that she didn’t even have sex with her man, and then proceeds to make fun of how ugly my man was, telling her other roommates how I wanted to go back with him and how obsessed with him I was. I was embarrassed, and I got mad and snippy because I literally made it obvious that I didn’t want to go back with him. 

I’m ashamed, I’m disappointed that I couldn’t stick up for myself more, and she’s only making me feel worse. It’s been two days since and tomorrow I leave to go back to Prague so I kind of let it go now.  I want to have a good rest of time with her. She hasn’t mentioned it today, so I’m glad.  I just feel like shit about it, and it makes me upset that she spoke about it in the way that she did after and made fun of me. Needless to say, I’m excited to go back to Prague tomorrow and take care of myself, spend some time alone and recoup. Thanks for reading

EDIT: forgot to mention that he did eat me out, and it was good but he did it after finishing the joint in an effort to try to get me in the mood. Still, he ignored me saying I was tired. Head is head though, so I can’t complain. Everything besides that was an absolute nightmare though. 

EDIT 2: spoke with my friend about it. I was as mature as possible, and she responded honestly saying how she genuinely didn’t mean to be mean and she would never wanna make me feel that way. She apologized to me very sincerely. Thank you to everyone who told me to say something, it gave me the courage to say something and I feel better knowing she didn’t do that to me purposely.

I can’t stop thinking about this scenario - how badly did I mess up?,"I’ve lived alone in my apartment with my toddler son for 3 months now. We are always walking around the complex, and have gotten to know many neighbors and the maintenance men a bit. A few weeks back, the fact that my son’s birthday is coming up came up in conversation with one of the maintenance men (who also lives in the complex), I’ll call him Chris. Chris said he was going to get my son a present, but I honestly thought he was joking. I kind of politely laughed it off and moved on.  

Well today we see Chris, and he says his present for my son is in his car. Convo proceeds as follows:  
Chris: “I was going to bring it by the other night, but I wasn’t sure if your husband would get mad or whatever”.   
Me (IDIOT): “Well it’s just the two of us [gesturing to my son] so no worries!”  
I realized immediately after my mistake. My paranoia has me thinking about the fact he has keys to my place and such. I will say, he did bring the gift by a few minutes ago, and it was a fine interaction. This is my first time “living alone” (as the only adult), so not sure if I’m over thinking what was simply a nice gesture.

“I don’t know what to do…”,"“I seriously don’t know what to do…”

I was having a perfect day today. I rushed my makeup and forgot my falsies and setting spray, but I made it to work on time, absolutely killed it, and was let off early because it wasn’t busy and we were over staffed. 

I immediately went home and changed and glammed up my look, remembering my falsies and setting spray, and decided instead of bussing to the mall I would walk because the weather was fair, fair for April in northern Ontario. 

I finished buying groceries and hangers, and went to the bus stop. All of the stores in the mall were closing, so the bus stop was crowded. I stood near a bench and this man right away said “DAMN, I bet we’re going on the same bus?”

I ignored him and he began talking to me fishing for responses “you wouldn’t happen to be going to the [blah blah bar] would you?” and just being a huge creep. He was probably 40 but looked 60 from drugs or alcohol and dressed like he was 20 with missing teeth and and chains. I was carrying coat hangers and groceries, I sure as hell wasn’t trying to find a bar to go to on a nice Sunday.

I looked over in the bus shelter and noticed a lesbian couple, knew they were a couple because they kissed, so I escaped into there with them and ANOTHER CREEP CAME AFTER ME!!!

He cornered me in the shelter and started talking about my dreamcatcher earrings and how I can help him with his nightmares and asked if I believe in that stuff, and then started asking my name and making fun of me when I shyly answered him. I thought of the girls stuck deeper in the bus shelter and blocked the entire entrance with my body and groceries until he went away.

One of the ladies said right away “I was gonna say something if he kept harassing you!”

“I don’t know what to do!” I said in a whiny voice, and they both laughed at me.

“I seriously **don’t know what to do…**” I was about to cry and my old manly voice came out, and they realized right then and there that I’m transgender… and that I *seriously* didn’t know what to do…

“Ohhhh……..” was the only thing out of their mouth after hearing my real voice…

I feel so dirty. I was wearing a long puffy coat that almost touches my knees. I ran away from them. I just wanted to be alone, and I didn’t feel safe. I ran with all my groceries and didn’t even bother taking my shopping cart, and found a quiet bus stop far away from the mall and waited 30 minutes for the next bus. Alone. 

I don’t know what to do. I ignored them and they still harassed me. I walked away and I still got followed. I tried being respectful while clearly showing disinterest, and they still hit on me. I tried finding safety in numbers and felt like I endangered those poor ladies rather than protect myself - and who knows wether or not they were TERFs? 

I ran away, and instead of taking the bus all the way to the terminal and maybe running into one of them again scared me so much, I got off the bus 12 stops early and walked 20 minutes home avoiding downtown while lugging my heavy groceries during sunset. 

It was a perfect day until men ruined it. 

And I don’t know what to do when I’m alone in all of this.

Okay… Thanks for the downvotes I guess… (first 10 minutes lol)

Wow!! You ladies are amazing 🥲 I wish I could read all the comments and reply, but I’m on my break and have to hold my tears back! Thank you all so so much 💖✨

Okay, this isn’t my first rodeo on Reddit. Transphobes find these threads and downvote every comment. I’m reading every comment and if I disagreed with anything I would have said so. So for anyone coming back to check on this, just know I’m reading every single comment and I know we’re all here for nothing but love and support. Thank you all for being my big sisters! I was not expecting so much wisdom and power to be sent my in my direction and I want you all to know you helped.

Lastly, many of the comments are suggesting violence. I’m a devout pacifist, and today was not easy on my spirit. This has potential for a much deeper conversation, but I believe I might have to reconsider my stance on pacifism and it’s hard to think about it without crying…

I’ve made the mistake of chiming into an Ask thread (vent),"The thread is literally asking what’s the worst part about being a woman and I was chiming in on how much it sucks to always be on guard. I said that I envy men because I’d love to talk night walks but I can’t-it isn’t safe

A group of men screamed at me from their truck that I was a dumb bitch for wearing a face mask,"My family  ordered takeout the other night, and the restaurant was only like .3 miles away so I just went to walk and get it by myself because no one else wanted to. I wore a facemask and I was walking down the street by myself minding  my own business, it was really dark. All the sudden I heard a truck pull up behind me and then a man, in a really aggressive voice yelled at me:
 “I TOO LIKE TO WEAR FACEMASKS ALL ALONE” 

I live with my mom who has lupus which is why I’m being so careful- she can’t get covid, it would be bad. 

So I screamed back “My mother is immunocompromised you fucking asshole” but as soon as he heard the word immunocompromised he and all his friends started screaming “fuck you” and kept calling me a dumb bitch until they drove away. 

This happened in Northern Arizona and it really, really shook me up. Being screamed at by a group of men when you’re alone and it’s dark is scary enough, but what I don’t get is how they were so upset that a woman they don’t even know had a face mask on. Like why do they care? It wasn’t effecting them in any way, they just wanted to scare and intimidate me. It was so shitty, and this country is so divided it scares me.",TwoXChromosomes,1835,1591205428.0,191,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/gvyb8a/a_group_of_men_screamed_at_me_from_their_truck/
I finally reported my coworker for innaproptiate actions and comments.,"Update 2: he was let go! It was not for this situation but purely on work performance! I feel like such a weight is off my shoulders 

In my job, I have the opportunity to train new employees. My trainee this go around has done nothing but belittle me and make inappropriate comments and sexually explicit comments towards me. He has made comments about me being his next wife and chaining me up so I could never leave him. He has made jokes about there being no such thing as consent because everyone wants it (it was situationally relevant for the tasks we had that day). He blamed and yelled at me in front of clients for things he did wrong, introduced me as his secretary and told the clients I was only there for eye candy. (proven wrong when I had to step in because he was ROYALLY f-ing up.) 

After observing him today, I realized he doesn't know anything about the job! For whatever reason, that was the last straw for me and I went to my boss. Thankfully, my boss is a 0 tolerance type of guy and ratcheted it to his bosses and hr. My boss assured me it did the right thing and asked if I needed to be picked up (trainee and I carpooled and I wasn't with my car) or needed anything. 

I pride myself on being very open-minded, and I have brushed off several comments from other employees, but I truly believe this person is a walking lawsuit and I fear for the safety of any person, especially any woman, that would have to meet with him. 

As part of this process, I had to spend time transcribing every inappropriate comment, gesture, and feeling, but I DID IT!

I STOOD UP FOR MYSELF! The email has been sent to HR and after tomorrow I will likely never have to see this gross man again. 

On an unrelated note, while I was typing the email to HR, I got a call that my dog is terminal and will not make it very long, this was somewhat expected but hearing it from the vet was really rough. Today SUPER sucked but I stood up for myself and I can snuggle my sick puppy. I have already been approved time off for mental health. Thanks for reading my emotional rollercoaster of a day. Sorry for any grammar or spelling, I'm on mobile and f#*$#$ exhausted. Cheers. 

UPDATE: 

Oh my goodness this took off! Thank you all for the kind words, love, support and hugs you have sent. The Director of HR called me today (I work for a large company, so that was very nice) and the first thing she asked was if I was safe, and how am I emotionally feeling. I did see that individual today, but met him at the site and called out sick the rest of the day. HR and I both decided it would be unsafe for me to return and work with him especially because we work from home offices. His training was transferred to a male employee who also expressed his safety concerns, so they had to call a third person because no one wants to work with this guy. Everything has been officially reported, and it looks like he will not pass the training program (save the company from having to fire him.) I will NEVER have to see him again and I have been approved for ""mental/emotional health"" days. 

Regarding my puppy, she had blood tests today and they showed that her health is not declining as much as previously believed, but she still has about a year left with us. 

Three random wonderful things today (because it's easy to focus on the shitty)
-I was fixing my makeup in the car, and an elderly woman gave me a thumbs up and told me I am beautiful
-While I was talking to the trainee telling him I would be going home sick he got angry. At that minute, a coworker (I have never seen another coworker out in the field) walked out of the building and saw what was going on. The nice coworker insisted he had questions and would walk me to my car (he had no questions, just saw a bad situation and wanted to help).
-The man at chick fil a heard the end of my conversation with HR said, ""That did not sound like a good conversation, are you okay"" I responded yes and he told me, ""I am sorry people can be mean, but you are a wonderful person"" he had no context and no other knowledge. 

For ANYONE reading this going through the same situation, REPORT IT! This has happened to so many people based on comments and it is not acceptable, you are not alone.

To my jellybean I’m sorry I didn’t save you,"It’s been three years today that I lost you at the hands of a man whose name I will curse until my dying day.  He was not your father ,the man that sired you left a week before I knew you existed . for the  5  to 6 months that followed I would feverishly hope he would walk through the door and come back to me like he promised he would and make everything ok .  I did everything in my power to make sure you were healthy  and that you were loved .  I softy read the hobbit to you every night and the fae touched poetry of W.b Yates every morning  . Your nursery was a light grey with rainbows  I wanted your first years to be full of love and whimsy the things I never had at your age.  Your name was going to be winter I loved the snow. I loved you beyond  measure but I failed to protect you .   If you had a chance to draw breath would you of liked the things I had planned?  The animated don bluth films  I would of shown you  , the way  the sunlight filters through the trees on a summer day causing the lawn to look magical and the names of the stars and planets in the  in the vast dark sky . Would you have had your fathers sorrowful grey eyes ? My small nose? You even had books already  I knew you would of loved Clifford.  That day all I asked that man was what he wanted for lunch he snapped and I bled in the tub for eight hours  in a locked bathroom  until you arrived . Perfect  tiny and fragile as glass my son . I buried you in the garden  hot blood  still trickling down my legs  the man wanted you thrown away I needed you give peace . The air was heavy with humidity and wild mint . I didn’t name you winter and   I’m so sorry I couldn’t protect you. I named you after your father and placed a single dandelion on your grave .

"Male friend is ""chill"" and doesn't understand why I am not ""chill""","I have a good friend who I love. His wife is my best friend, I've been close with both of them for like fifteen years at this point.

He's the best, I know he means well....but I'm going to freak out if he makes one more comment about how tolerant he is and how INTOLERANT i am.

The context: I was riding my bike across the street today, and a man mowing his lawn across the street  made a point of stopping his mowing to stare at me for the full five seconds it took me to cross the street. It was so annoying I shouted ""STARING IS FUCKING RUDE"" and gave him the finger. The dudes in this town are absolutely the worst with their staring, it is disgusting and I hate it. I want to just RIDE MY BIKE like a MAN and be ignored by the world entirely.

I was so annoyed that when my friend messaged me ""hey hows it goin"" (v normal for our friendship to have regular check ins) I just told him about it. Totally enraged. He said he would have just ignored the man, and then went on to say ""***well I'm generally more chill than you I think***."" Unfortunately, this isn't the first time he's made a generalizing statement about our personalities based on shitty specific situations.

I snapped.

SIR. OF COURSE YOU WOULD IGNORE THIS DUDE. It would be weird and out of place for a man to stare you down in such a way. MEANWHILE, for me and for a TON Of women, this is a daily occurrence and we are fucking tired. I am sick of it. I am sick of men driving by me slowly when I walk on the sidewalk. Like 5 mph, just to force eye contact. I am sick of men in the cars next to me staring at me at stop lights, to the point where they don't notice the light has changed...because again, they are trying to force eye contact. I am sick of it. I am not being intolerant, I am justifiably FUCKING PISSED.

I'd also be very chill and tolerant if I was left alone all day every day. I'd be chill as fuck. BUT NO. I DO NOT HAVE THAT OPTION. I HAVE NOT BEEN LEFT ALONE IN PUBLIC SINCE I WAS THIRTEEN YEARS OLD.

I have officially raised my friendship standards. I told him he could feel comfy in his tolerance all day long, but he was a fool to ignore the differences in men and women when it comes to ""tolerance"" of publicly harassing behavior. He didn't know how to respond and went silent. GOOD. THINK ABOUT IT AND GET BACK TO ME, BABE.

My girlfriend got assaulted right in front of me,"My (35f) girlfriend (32f) was groped whilst we were waiting for our Uber home last Friday night. It was around 1am and we were waiting at a bus stop in central London. This guy who had half an unlit cigarette hanging out of his mouth came up to us and first of all asked me if I had a lighter. I said no and he moved on to my gf who was standing next to me maybe a metre or two away and he asked her the same question to which she also replied no. I thought that was that. I live in London so I feel like I’m pretty used to the random, mostly innocuous encounters like these, especially late at night, and although we’ve had some unpleasant words thrown at us in the past from men who feel the need to comment about two women being together, these encounters generally do not phase me and I am fortunate that nothing seriously bad has ever happened. 

Anyway, we both had our phones out as we were trying to book an Uber/Bolt to see which one would arrive quickest so we were a bit distracted and obviously not giving this guy much attention. Instead of walking away after my gf replied no to his question about the lighter, he swung his arm out from underneath him and grabbed her crotch. 

In the moment she was stunned and basically just flinched and before she could do much else I threw myself at him and pushed him away shouting “what the fuck, fuck off” type stuff. He tried to grab me by the throat and I could see in his eyes and the way he was trying to position his body that he wanted to punch me but he didn’t. I was holding him by his shirt at the neck and just yanking and pushing him away, shouting at him. I was wearing a crossbody bag so my girlfriend grabbed on to the strap behind me and yanked me back so that I wouldn’t get in a full on physical altercation with this guy. 

He walked away and I turned around and checked on my gf who was just saying things like “stop trying to fight him it’s not worth it”. At this point I’m desperately hoping for our Uber driver to arrive and the guy fucking comes back and of course I go lunging at him again just telling him to fuck off but again my gf holds me back. He’s just shouting shit at us and eventually turns around and walks away.

Thankfully our Uber driver finally arrives and then it all suddenly hit and my gf starts crying. She cried the whole journey home and cried basically all night. I tried to comfort her but she would just physically push me away or tell me to leave her alone which was really tough and I didn’t know what to do or say. Eventually we were lying in bed and I just held her for a long time without saying anything whilst she was sobbing and eventually said “I just need you to tell me that I’m safe and that it’s not my fault” which of course I did and managed to say a few other thoughts about the situation but I just didn’t think I could say anything to fix the way she was feeling…

She asked me if I thought she was overreacting, and of course I said no, but I guess in the moment I didn’t quite realise the gravity of what this guy did. He basically sexually assaulted her. He committed a crime. And so publicly, just in the middle of the street with witnesses around, like it was absolutely nothing. It’s so gross and makes me feel so sick and so sad that this act was clearly so “normal” to this guy that he probably regularly attacks women and gets away with it every time. It’s just so unfair. 

Luckily my gf managed to get over the shock of it and we tried to not let it ruin our weekend. Obviously we are grateful it wasn’t anything worse but it was just a really shitty experience and it sucks feeling so helpless in a situation like that.

I just wanted to get this off my chest really. If anyone has experienced something similar  first of all I am so sorry and if you are comfortable sharing how you helped each other through it I would love to hear it because I wish I could have been more supportive in the moment towards her (instead of just violent and reactive towards him!) and found the right words to say to help her through it.

My Best Friend (F22) was SAd in a Gay Bar. Women Aren’t Safe Anywhere,"So with my friend’s permission, I wanted to anonymously share her story with you all. Because once again, she is left traumatized and enraged as many of us are and have been. 


I want to start by sharing some perhaps relevant details. She is very traditionally attractive, has long blonde hair and blue eyes, about 5’7 and 120lbs, relatively feminine presenting. Gets hit on by men 24/7 even though she’s an openly flaming lesbian in a LTR. And she unfortunately already has a lengthy history of prior sexual assaults. 



So a couple nights ago, she goes out with a few gay (cis male) friends to the only gay night club/bar in her urban, GA city. She gets up and starts dancing with her friends on the dance floor after a couple drinks together. They’re basically dancing in a circle and having a good time. Then eventually this guy shows up out of nowhere, and starts dancing in their circle with them. So it’s chill, and then her friends kind of start dancing together on their own. And this guy holds his hand out to her, and assuming he’s gay, she takes it, and she twirls him around her… like a friendly, gay, twink. But then he interlocks their fingers and starts pulling her into him, trying to place her hand on his shoulder and her other hand on his waist, and she pulls away from him. 



But his grip only got tighter, and he starts literally grinding on her. At that point she said stop, loudly, and pulled away again. But as he’s grinding on her, he reaches down, grabs her ass, and pulls her into him and then grabs her by the chin to look up at him. Then he leans down into her and guides her head, to make her kiss his neck. Then she says stop loudly again, and tries to free herself. She manages to face the other way looking for her friend, when he then grabs her from behind, starts humping her with his raging boner and pushes her back forward to bend her over. Then she catches sight of her friend and yells loudly at him to help her. He came running over and yanked her away from him, back the few steps to where they had started, and the guy ran off. 


She asked when they’d leave and her friend said “in a few” bc he was (drunk) busy making out with his partner. So she walked out of the bar the long way around, and the asshole guy bumps into her to thank her for the dance. She’s like “whatever” and he continues to follow her out of the bar. He goes “My name’s M what’s yours?” And she says “good for you” still walking away. At which point he left her alone, with his tail between his legs. 



Not even 9 months ago she was at a high end club with her girlfriend, walked away from her drink for all of two minutes to dance, came back for a sip, and was roofied. She started puking, passed out, and was taken to a hospital via ambulance when nobody could get her to wake up. Someone weird and sketchy was trying to pick her up from the hospital so she refused care, discharged herself, and went home. 





Even with therapy, a great gf, and a fantastic support network, she cannot live in a moment’s peace, go anywhere, do anything with anyone, without constant anxiety and paranoia that a man, ANY man, could and would try to do something to her. (As I’m sure many of us have felt far too many times.) She can’t go to a GAY male bar with GAY friends, without a man trying something. Because men EVERYWHERE are a THREAT. And NO woman is safe anywhere. End of rant. ",TwoXChromosomes,640,1710123017.0,188,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1bbrz6b/my_best_friend_f22_was_sad_in_a_gay_bar_women/
No idea how to approach my daughter with a confusing sex discussion,"This happened last night, I'm still shaken by it and I'd like some advice from mothers and, perhaps, daughters as well.

I'm a single father and I have two daughters: 19 and 16.  My youngest is enrolled at an all girl's Catholic school in our city.  We aren't a religious family, she attends this school because it has a tennis team, while the local public school does not.  I had never thought about the effect going to an all girl's school might have on her, my eldest went to the same school and (as far as I know) had no issue with it.

I work long hours and I get home late most nights.  Because of this my daughter walks home from school with her male cousin every afternoon.  This isn't because I don't think she can't take care of herself, rather, my sister doesn't think her son can take care of himself (he's 14).

Yesterday, I wasn't feeling well and I decided to take the day off.  I was in my office when my daughter and her cousin came home.  I had headphones on and didn't hear them come in, but around 5 PM I decided to head into the kitchen to prepare dinner.

*I walked in on my daughter and my nephew performing oral sex upon one another.*  I shouted out, they both quickly got dressed, and I called my sister to come pick her son up.  I didn't know what to say to them and I definitely didn't know what to say to my sister, so I told them I had to think about things first and to not worry (for now).

I made dinner and we ate and my daughter filled me in on a few things (she volunteer the information, I did not ask):

* It was her idea, not his.  If anyone should get in trouble it should says it should be her.

* She has been wondering about sex for a while and, while I had given her the birds and the bees talk, she claims she feels left out because she goes to an all girl's school.

* This was, apparently, the first time and they're not interested in each other (""I don't have a crush on him"").  I got the feeling this was simply because he was the most easily-accessible male.

* She said she and her best friend (female) have done similar things with one another and that she doesn't think she is gay.

I don't mind the curiosity, I don't mind the experimentation either.  We're a very pro-LGBTQ family, etc. but **incest** is not something I thought I would have to deal with.

I do not have a wife to discuss this with and I don't want to ask my other daughter for advice.  I'm afraid to approach my sister with this information because she's much, much more conservative than I am.

I want to have a happy, healthy, discussion with my daughter and let her know I love her and will help her get whatever information she wants, but that cousin + cousin stuff is... traditionally not OK.  I don't want to scare her.

Help?

**Update #1:** OK, thank you for all of the wonderful replies.  I got home from work, read all of the replies, and sat down with my daughter.  First, we live in a state where age of consent is 16 and there are allowances for people close in age, so legally she is fine.  The website I visited to check described it as ""age of offender"" and ""age of victim/survivor"" which absolutely broke my heart.  Furthermore, while she instigated, I do not think he resisted because she showed me some texts on her phone where she asks beforehand and he agrees.  The original plan was to try this weekend, but my nephew/sister ended up going out of town instead.

Second, thank you thank you thank you to /u/Lil_Boots1 .  I explained the different types of relationships there are and how people may even shift between them (friend -&gt; romance -&gt; friend or even something less than a friend) and how there are certain boundaries that make certain relationships not possible or detrimental for certain groups of people (relatives, co-workers, etc.).  She reiterated that they were not ""into each other,"" but that she simply wanted to ""see what it was like.""  She has male friends that she routinely hangs out with, but, apparently, they all have girlfriends, are ""gross,"" or have some other factor that made them undesirable (?).

Third, we talked about school and she definitely wants to continue where she is.  My other daughter earned a tennis scholarship and she is actually the poorer player (between the two).  Money isn't exactly tight for us, but it would help me avoid a lot of student loans.  I don't think this is factoring in to her decision, she genuinely seems to like school and tennis for their own sake, not just because it might be a financial boon in a few years.

Fourth, I've decided to continue to let them hang out together.  I think cutting off contact would just be too weird for everyone involved and I do trust both of them still.  I haven't talked to my sister and nephew yet, so this might change if she feels differently, but I think cutting contact, or watching them them like a hawk, would send the wrong message.

Fifth, I've looked up some co-ed groups around town that she can join.  There is a tennis club, but it looks a bit too basic for her.  She also enjoys photography, but there doesn't seem to be anything for high school students (only college kids).  I told her she can do research and I'll let her join club or whatever she wants (within reason).

I'm going to shower and then drive over to my sister's place.  I'll try to update again afterwards, but thank you again for the wonderful suggestions.

**Update #2:** First of all, what is wrong with all the Redditors who are sending me private messages to ""kill [my]self"" or ""have [my] daughter practice on [me] instead""?  Please, take a look at your own lives and think about what would motivate you to say such things.

Second, my sister was quite understanding.  I think there were some misconceptions when I said my nephew couldn't take care of himself.  I meant he would eat nothing put chips/soda if he was left to his own devices.  Nothing more than that.  My daughter had texted my nephew while I was on my way over, so he knew I was coming.  My sister knew something was up, but didn't believe me at first.  I told her privately what had happened and she said ""Seriously?"" quite a few times.  She called my nephew into the room and asked him a few questions, the gist of the story was the same: my daughter had floated the idea with him about a week ago, he had agreed immediately (no coercion) and I caught them during the first and only act.

My sister didn't say much before sending him away again.  We had a small chat, she felt the same way I did: they're young, they're questioning things, etc.  She has apparently caught him looking at pornography a few times.  In a weird way, she seemed relieved it wasn't with ""some stranger.""  She agrees cutting off contact would be a stupid idea and end up making family gatherings needlessly uncomfortable.

Lastly, a few people have asked where ""the mother"" is.  She died of breast cancer almost 10 years ago.  Someone mentioned sex toys being a healthy way to experiment and I like that idea, so I'm going to go the gift card route and let her choose on her own.  I don't want to know any more about that then I have to.

Thank you again.  I never thought any of this would ""end bad"" or ""blow up"" or whatever.  I just wanted to make sure I continued in the best way possible and I think things are OK for now.  I don't know if/how my sister will handle things with her son, but that is her business not mine.

"My Neighbor’s Daughter Died [CW: transphobia, loss of a child, suicide]","CW: Transphobia, loss of a child, suicide

I have lurked here for a long time, I hope this is the right place to share. I hope that by sharing, others like me who are usually silent will be persuaded to be more vocal in their support of trans youth. I have removed identifying details because this story is my experience largely as a bystander to another family’s tragedy.

My neighbor Sue (not her name) moved in across the street about a year ago. Sue moved in first, did some fixing up, then her daughter came to join her a few weeks later.  Sue is a nice middle-aged lady, very practical, handy around the house and yard. We chatted when she first arrived; she mentioned moving so that her daughter could attend the local school, better than in their previous area. I never formally met the daughter but I saw her around the neighborhood. She made a friend in the cul de sac and was forever walking back and forth with the friend, another high school girl. They both dyed their hair bright colors and generally seemed like the kind of offbeat, cool girls I would’ve liked to know in high school. But I’m a 35 year-old mom with brown hair, so not much in common there. I mostly made small talk with Sue about our gardens when my family took our evening walks.

My bedroom window faces the side of Sue’s house and her daughter’s bedroom window. Each night when I went to close my curtains, I could see across to the daughter’s window, blinds usually open and a big pink and blue pride flag visible on the wall opposite the window. She’s trans. 

I admire trans people, especially trans women. It’s not easy anywhere, for sure, but this is a small suburb in a red state, a state that is doing its best to legislate trans folk out of existence. I’m not certain I would have what it takes to live that truth here. And as a teen, forget it. So I think highly of Sue’s daughter, walking the sidewalks in her long pink hair and cute cardi and jeans. I’ve never talked to this child, but we are neighbors and she seems like a cool kid.

Two nights ago, I was putting my youngest to bed when we heard sirens outside. I’m getting texts from my mom friend across the street. Something’s going on. She thinks it’s the sketchy dudes two houses down that maybe sell drugs. I look out my bedroom window. There’s a fire truck, ambulance, several cop cars. The whole cavalry. But the paramedics run into Sue’s house. I can just make out figures moving around in her daughter’s room. Oh, this is a terrible feeling. I text Sue, say I just hope everyone’s okay, we’re here if you need anything. I immediately regret texting her while there’s obviously a crisis ongoing, but I’m also quietly hoping to hear about a faulty security alarm, a prank, even a mild heart attack, please, anything but the only explanation loudly ringing in my head.

Sue replied some time later. Her daughter died. I learn only now, in this text conversation, that her daughter’s name is Taryn. I learn the next day, in a tearful driveway exchange with Sue, that Taryn had been struggling for two years prior. I did everything I possibly could for her, she tells me. Sue was walking to the cul de sac to knock on the door of Taryn’s friend, who I learn is named Cath. To give Cath’s mom the awful news and tell her to look out for her daughter.

Taryn died on the spring equinox, on a beautiful full moon, on the day where the light finally starts to outweigh the darkness. Or at least that’s what is promised.

When I close the curtains now, no pink and blue flag. No light on in the room. No best friends passing by on the sidewalk.  

I got a flag for our house. I’m not someone who is comfortable making big public displays of opinion. I don’t even have any bumper stickers. I had to research and figure out the right flag to get. The one that says hey neighbors, we stand with all the people these colors represent, and it’s a whole bunch of goddamn colors and fuck you if you don’t because it’s my house and my flag and my neighborhood too. If Taryn were still alive she would have seen it. It would have been unmissable on her walks with Cath. I will see it every day and wish it had always been up. It took a terrible thing going down right in my front yard to make me buy a stupid flag, and that’s my problem and it’s not all better because of the flag. I’m so sad for Sue and for Cath and for Taryn and all the people who loved her. I’m so ashamed to have been silent when there was a chance to speak up as a neighbor and an adult and a parent and a woman with many kinds of privilege. I’m so sorry, Taryn.",TwoXChromosomes,2219,1647746329.0,103,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/tic00x/my_neighbors_daughter_died_cw_transphobia_loss_of/
Being a woman is fucking scary sometimes.,"I really just need to write this to vent as i just had a massive panic attack. For reference, i live with a male roommate. 

I feel like i shouldn’t even have to be writing this out right now but here i am. I was laying in bed and i hear my doorbell go off. It was in the evening and i’m not expecting anyone so i assumed it was maybe my landlord, apartment maintenance or something. I look through the peep-hole, and no one was there. 

I thought to myself “Huh, maybe my landlord left a note in the door because he thought we weren’t home?”

I open my door and i see a man, probably 6’3 and in his mid to late 20’s leaning on the side of the house out of view from the peep hole. I’m 21, 5’2 and 130lbs I immediately got chills. He asks “Do you have a charger?” in a really monotone voice. I don’t know this man, he’s not any of my neighbors and i just got really scared. He looked me up and down. I told him i would check and see with a smile. I shut my door and lock it right after that.

I run to my roommates room, and snatch his headset off and tell him what’s going on. My hands are shaking and i feel like i’m going to throw up. I don’t know why i reacted this way, but i did. He gets up and looks through the peep hole, now the man is standing in front of it with a hood on. I’m literally pacing back and forth wondering what to do. Why would he come to a second story apartment to ask for a phone charger? 


I grab a broken one with a cube, hand it to my roommate and tell him to give it to him, but about 5 minutes of contemplating this and he left. 

I don’t know. I’m just really shaken up by this. Not to mention- i’m an online creator so the possibilities that come along with that are fucking scary. I came to a realization that i can’t live alone. I don’t know what i would’ve done if i was.


edit- wow holy shit i didn’t expect this to get so many upvotes :’) i have a very much needed therapy appointment tomorrow so this will be perfect to let out my anxiety surrounding the whole thing. also, i hate reading that so many of you have had similar experiences. i’ve been on edge all night and it’s been hard to sleep. thank you guys for validating my concerns, and if you’ve been through this before then your concerns and fears are valid too. stay safe

I told my SO I was molested as a child. Then she told me she was also molested. Now she's thinking about leaving me. I need perspective please.,"throwaway, sorry. I hope you understand. Wall of text ahead. Proceed at own risk.

I told my girlfriend of 4 years I was molested as a small boy. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I just couldn't keep it in any longer and, I don't know, I just wanted someone besides myself to tell me it was going to be okay.

For the longest, I had suppressed these thoughts/memories. I thought my life would fall apart if I ever let myself think about them. I thought it was my fault. Something I did. It was someone who I thought cared about me. So that scared me. And it was by a man (my uncle) and the very thought of questioning my sexuality terrified me as well.

So I forgot them, at least I thought I did. I knew there was some deep sadness in me and it would creep out sometimes but I honestly couldn't remember why and I never cared to. I just thought I was one of those people who were just prone to bouts of depression. A couple days in the dark all alone, not leaving my bed except to pee, and it would pass. It always did.


So now I'm 22 years old. My life is moving upwards. For the first time in my life, I am confident about my future. A couple months ago I started to have these thoughts; thoughts turned to memories; memories into nightmares. Everything came back to me. After years of pushing it into the farthest parts of my mind, it became all I could think about. I knew I had to talk to someone but what happened to me as a child left me with ridiculous trust issues. Self-esteem issues that I never really understood.


My gf is the kindest person I've ever met. She comes from a stable family (as opposed to the dysfunctional hand of a family I was dealt). She had both parents and they were educated as well. She never could handle stress well but that's where I came in. I always, except on very rare occasions, gave the aura of a calm person. Someone who could be relied upon. And so we worked well together. I thought I could tell her this dark secret because she made me feel safe.


One night, we were at my house and getting ready for sex. I very much enjoy the build up, the foreplay. Sorry for the overshare but it's waaaay too late to worry about that. Anyways, something happened that I'm still not sure of, but I stopped. She asked me what was wrong... and then I told her everything. 

I always imagined I'd get very emotional telling this story to someone. Like in the movies. But other than a couple pregnant pauses on my part, there was nothing. I was never really good at opening up. She on the other hand was crying before I even finished. I held her. After a little while, she looked up at me and told me her story. She was molested. Also by her uncle (fucking uncles amiright??). She was about 7 years old I think. The thought of my girlfriend as a small innocent child being...I don't think I've ever cried harder in my life. We held each other. Everything was gonna be okay.


Or so I thought. A month went by and everything was good. We never really expanded on our confessions but it never came up. We were always so happy around each other. And we were both fairly busy. Her with college/part-time work and me working full time (I start college in January), that we tended to savor our moments together. We didn't want to spend them crying.

Now, I mentioned how she was bad at handling stress earlier. She had recently moved out, so she had to take more hours at work. She was also struggling with a class at school. So I didn't want to tell her how I felt a little distance between us recently. We were seeing even less of each other and I didn't want to add to her stress by asking for a little more personal time.


A couple days ago, we had a conversation on the phone that was kind of intense. At this point, it had been about a week and a half since I'd seen her. I met up with her before she started work and asked her what was wrong. She basically told me that every time she looked at me, she thought of what happened to her. That the last night we spent a night together (about a week before that), she would keep waking and get scared of the man in her bed and have to remind herself it was me. She said it was not okay that she wasn't able to sleep next to me. I tried to tell her it wasn't her fault. That it was okay. I tried to tell her that even after we confessed to each other, we had spent nights together and we would always end up oversleeping. With all of the stress of her life and ""her problems with men"" and school and work, she wondered if it was healthy for her to be in a relationship.


I could barely believe what I was hearing. I had showed her the most vulnerable part of me and I had it blow up in my face. I posted this here because I think I need the perspective of a woman but actually I just need someone to relate to. Thank you so much for listening.


Tl;dr: Me and SO both been diddled. Tears were had. Now everythings fucked up and I regret all of it.


EDIT: I can't believe this many people give a fuck. Even if it is an internet fuck. I'm reading through everything and, with each comment, I'm gaining perspective that I would have never had before. I am truly grateful. ",TwoXChromosomes,1188,1417347059.0,531,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2nu6et/i_told_my_so_i_was_molested_as_a_child_then_she/
My (26F) boyfriend (28F) mock strangled me. Is is just poor humour or is this guy dangerous?,"Whilst I was camping alone with my boyfriend, he had a few hours of low mood from lowering his antidepressant meds. For context, he knows I was preoccupied with my personal safety whilst camping. When he arrived I told him I felt safer now I was with a male. The first night I spent with a female friend only.

 I was scrolling on my phone when he approached me from behind and mock strangled me without  pressure. Then sat down and brought up a Louis CK comedy skit about how the number one threat to women is men, and going on a date with them is 'rolling the dice'. His bought this skit up many times.  So the conversation turned to women being murdered. 

As the convo went on, I said he'd make a good schoolteacher. He said no, because 'I'm a killer' and then immediately panicked at his word slip up, that's not what he meant to say.

He also doesn't want kids as his greatest worry is if the child dies, then the government would investigate if he was at fault.


His personality has been green flags. His not controlling, he takes responsibility for his actions, his humble, cares for animals and is trusting of me. He is childish in his hobbies and is into dark humour. The only pink flag is he playfully restrains me at times when I try to leave bed, one time he threw something at my face (not angrily) and another time he pushed me off the bed for shits and giggles. A friend doing this wouldn't scare me, but because he is a man/partner it makes me worried for potential  abuse.


I don't know if having the heebie-jeebies is warranted? I just think respectable men would not simulate abuse on their partner even as a joke. I'm unsettled to think he did it because part of him got something out of it.

 Could this guy be a monster deep, deep down or is it thoughtless humour?

"""it probably made you feel good, though""","I was talking to my dad about walking my dog around the apartment complex the other night, and some guy whistled at me from his garage. I ignored him. He stepped out a little more, and loudly whistled again. One of those weet-woo whistles. 

I ended up just pulling on the leash, and steering my dog away. He didn't follow me or anything. But it was late/dark, and it made me uncomfortable. 

As I was telling my dad this story, he laughed and said, ""But it probably made you feel good, right?""

No. No, it did not. I have been working 60 hour work weeks. When I get home, I am exhausted. I don't want to talk to people, let alone get whistled at by them. It doesn't make me feel good to feel like I'm being looked over and judged-- approval or not. I just want to walk my dog. 
Not even including the fact that I immediately started worrying that he would keep following me.

I was being followed and called the police.,"Walking home from the grocery store. A man came up to me without a mask and I put my hand up to sat Im not interested and keep walking. He sayings stuff like “give me a chance” and “wow a real escape artist”. He is persistent in following me a few blocks, so I enter the first store I could find. I told the clerk that the man outside was following me and Ive been waiting for him to leave. She recommended that I contact 911. I called the police and they asked me to identify the individual. A hotel manager across the street  saw the police care and came over and said they kicked the man out this morning for a ‘mental health crisis’ and he has been wandering the area ever since. The police asked if he was threatening and I said no but he made me feel unsafe. I told them I didn’t feel comfortable walking outside and they drove me home. Then they drove back to talk to the man.

If ANYONE makes you feel uncomfortable, speak up and get help.

18F Dog Walker Feeling Unsafe Around Male Client—Need Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m an 18-year-old dog walker/sitter and run my own business. I have a male client in his mid/late 60s who I’ve walked for about 4 months, Monday–Friday.

When we first met, he seemed nice, but early on he made a few comments about my body, my boyfriend, and sexual things from his past. He also kissed my cheeks. At the time I didn’t feel like boundaries were crossed professionally.

A month after he became my client, he started making small sexual comments. After a video I accidentally sent showed my face for a split second, he began messaging me every 30 minutes on multiple platforms, calling me sexy, saying he adored my face, suggesting I wanted to kiss him. I asked him to stop and said it was inappropriate and made me uncomfortable. He said he would stop, but apologized only for how I felt, not his actions.

He stopped for about a week, but then in person he said things like “I can’t help it, you’re sexy” and continued for 10 minutes. He’s often supposed to be out of the house, but started being home more, without telling me. Recently, he: •	Commented he was jealous of his dog rubbing on my upper thigh •	Grabbed my hand and stared at me intensely •	Told me he had a dream where I hurt myself and I asked him to kiss it better, and said it was my fault he had the dream

I love his dog and the money is good, but I am genuinely scared every time I walk him. I’m not sure what to do—I don’t want to lose the dog, but I also don’t feel safe.

Am I overreacting? Should I end the client relationship? How would you handle this?


Update: Thank you so much for everyone’s replies, they’ve really helped me see things clearly. I’ll be stopping this client as of now.

For those suggesting I report to the police, what exactly would I say? I know I’d explain the events, but part of me feels like if I just end things, I won’t see him again. The thing that worries me is that he does have my address (from invoices), and I’d also need to avoid my usual walking woods since that’s where he lives. I think if I bumped into him again after ending things, he might try to hurt me to be completely honest",TwoXChromosomes,258,1755793995.0,109,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1mwfylt/18f_dog_walker_feeling_unsafe_around_male/
I am reclaiming pigtails ... from porn.  ,"When I was a kid, I used to wear pigtails/plaits all the time.  However, until recently I couldn't wear them without imagining myself in some kind of ""naughty schoolgirl"" uniform, bent over a desk, being begrudging rodgered by a man twice my age.  I couldn't think of pigtails without thinking of porno.

On the rare occasion I left the house with them in, I always experienced a bizzarre rise in harassment.  Everything from the innocuous 'nice pigtails love' to strangers hitting on me.  When I wore them to work my boss made a crass 'while you're down there' joke.  Wholly depressing.

But I am RECLAIMING THESE BABIES, damnit.  I love pigtails.  They keep my hair out of my face and I think they are cute.  I am not going to let fear of harassment or porno-association deter me from wearing them.  FUCK YOU PORN FOR STEALING MY HAIR STYLE.

Who's with me??! *punches air*

In celebration, [I took a picture.](http://imgur.com/HKAAG)

FO REAL THO - does anyone else find it they get more harassment/attention when they wear piggies?


EDIT : as someone pointed out, I prolly shouldnt be putting 'strangers hitting on me' automatically in the bracket of street harassment. However, sadly, 98% of incidents where strangers have 'hit on me' it's usually in a way that I feel constitute harassment; following me, making rude or aggressive comments, touching me, repeatedly trying to talk to me after I've politely declined their offer and sometimes blocking my way. That stuff. The 2% of incidents where guys have got it right (I.e talked to me like a fellow human being, maybe dropped a compliment or two and politely asked for my number), I've almost felt like applauding them. I've never given my number in that situation because I've never wanted to, but I am usually flattered and don't feel unsafe. So apologies for generalising.

Also, thank you so much for all the compliments (mental!) and sharing of your experiences. Great to hear both the positive and the negative - especially the more serious ones which really highlight the subtle lengths some ladies go to to avoid harassment and negative attention from others. This was my first proper post on TwoX (I usually just hang around in the comments endless regurgitating rape statistics), and you've made me feel super welcome and glad to be surrounded by a community of lovely men and women.

A man intentionally scared me on the way to work,"I was heading to work this morning. It’s 5:30 in the morning, it’s dark, and I’m at the transit center heading for the train. I was rushing trying to catch the next train so I was walking pretty quickly. I crossed the street and there was a man walking on the far sidewalk. As I get to the other side he stops right in front of me, turns to face me and says “why are you walking up on me like that?!” 

Now this guy isn’t much bigger than me. I’m average lady height, so he wasn’t very tall and wasn’t very muscular. But where I live there’s a problem with people and drugs. The kind of drugs that can make people do and say crazy things. So even though he wasn’t physically much bigger than me, he scared the hell out of me. He sounded so aggressive and serious like he really thought I was trying to sneak up on him or something. I’m a little ashamed to say it but I froze. My fight/flight/fawn trauma response kicked in and I just froze and said to him “I’m not!”

He repeated “why are you coming up on me like that?!” And sounded even more aggressive. I managed to squeak out “I’m just heading for the train!”

He stared at me for a second and then BUSTS OUT LAUGHING and says “I’m just kidding. You have a nice day” and continues on his way laughing. And my fawn response continued and I automatically gave a laugh in response and said “you too” and then hustled off to the train. 

He HAD to know why he was doing. I’m a woman, alone, in the dark, and he pulled that shit? He scared me so bad. I thought he was going to turn around and get physical with me. But no. He just wanted to scare me for a laugh. and now I’m on the train and away from him and I’m pissed. 

Oh and also he made me miss the train I was trying to catch by like 2 seconds. It locked as I tried to open the doors and left. So screw that guy

Huge shout out to those who look out for vulnerable strangers,"I work in a nightclub as a doorman. I was approached last night by 2 women who were concerned for a 3rd woman who seemed to be on her own. They said she was very drunk and there was a man taking advantage of the situation - kept touching her.

I asked to him leave and I assisted the woman. Two things quickly became apparent. She was on her own and she was totally out of it. There was no way I was going to leave her alone to wander off into the night so I walked with her out of the club to the street volunteers down the road (they have a safe shelter and help ensure people get home safely.) 

As I was walking her over the road, I began to believe that there was a possibility of her having had her drink spiked. 

There are always police around the shelter so I spoke to them about my concerns and was able to point out the man walking away. They immediately followed and one way or another, he is now known to them and our door staff.

Thank you to those 2 women who came to speak to me and to the wonderful volunteers who are out every weekend in all weather.

I really just lost my trust in men,"We were making a bar crawl with a group of roughly 15 people yesterday and in one of the bars three british men came in. 
We were on our way to the local river to sit there and enjoy the rest of the evening and one of our guys asked the three brits to come with us to the river 3 seconds after they came in. He probably did not think about how randomly inviting three strange men could affect the women in the group so I will let that pass. One of the brits went directly for me and immediatley came way to close. I was okay with talking with him because I like to practice my english but his jokes about having sex with me and kissing me after like 5 minutes of talking clearly overstepped a line. I then went to walk with some of my friends so he would leave me alone. 
On our way to the river his 2 other colleagues stayed behind so he was the only one of the three who stayed with us. After I got rid of him he talked with another woman of our group. Shortly after she came to us and told us that he made her uncomfortable as well and that she needs us as a safe space right now. He made sexual comments to her too and lay his arm around her shoulder etc. After that he went to the next woman. I was watching them to check if she is okay. Because I was not sure I went to her and said in our native language, which he does not understand, that if she feels uncomfortable she can tell me and I get rid of him. She immediately said that she indeed feels uncomfortable and I promised that I would be right back to send him away. 

Here comes the part that really made me lose my trust in men. 

I knew that he would not take me seriously if I told him to go alone, because he is a sexist who views women as walking fuckholes. Thats why I thought; Hey lets bring a penis because sexists like him respect penises. We are all at university in an european country so I expect the men there to be in average „the wokest“ of our society. So I asked one of my male friends, who I thought would join me immediately if I say that there is a man who makes us women uncomfortable. Instead he did not react at all. All men around us, who heard me saying whats going on did not react. The only person standing up to come with me was my female friend and I know how much she is afraid of confrontations, not to mention with strange men. Only as I said „Okay then I will go alone“ and making my way to the guy, three of the men stood up and followed me. The one I initially asked still sat there, not reacting at all.

I confronted the sexist guy, he of course denied it all and told me I was imagining things. When he drew the racist cart, and said we are sending him away because he is black and that he knew our country was racist I did see no need to talk to him any further because every word after that would be exactly what he wanted to achieve. He wanted that we feel the need to demonstrate that we are in fact not racist at all and put him self in the victim role. 
Three of the men kept talking with him for 5 minutes, helping him to find his way home and I imagine comforting him. It did not look like they were defending us women there but more like they sympathized with him. 

The one I initially asked did still not say anything about the situation and would not for the rest of the night.
When the men of our group finally came back one of them said „I did not see it happen so I have no opinion.“ We told him that when three women felt uncomfortable he does not need to see it happen to believe them. 

So that night I discovered that I can not trust the men around me, who I thought were woke and educated about sexism and sexual abuse, to be there for me or any other women when another men is a threat us. Even when we ask for help.

TLDR: A strange men was hitting inappropriately at the women in our group and made them feel uncomfortable. When I asked my male friends, who I think of as woke, to help me send him away no one reacted in the way I would wish for.",TwoXChromosomes,962,1655373586.0,200,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vdielm/i_really_just_lost_my_trust_in_men/
"Men created an unsafe world and then gaslight us by saying we are ""overly paranoid"" when we take caution.","Obligatory ""not all men"" ""the world isn't safe for men either"" blah blah.

I'm not sure if this post breaks rule 1 but I've seen similar posts and I'm just so fed up. I saw a tiktok video of two girls who were being followed by another car late at night. Somewhere along the comments I replied to someone and said that I'm often called crazy by men because I check the back seats of my car before getting in, and that men don't understand that women live in a different world than they do. And boy did this piss guys off.

I got a lot of replies saying that the men in my life are correct, that I am paranoid, that bad things like this never happen, crime rates are higher for men but we dont see them acting crazy (if this happens to you too, why dont you take precaution? why are you guys so mad about safety?), the whole 9 yards. I even had one say he would follow me around ""for fun' if he knew me. As if that doesn't prove my point, right? It's all a joke to them. They love to harass us, stalk us, kidnap us, kill us, and then laugh in our face when we get scared and chose to put our safety first, even if it is in seemingly ridiculous ways. I had another one say he doesn't want to hear shit from me about life being hard as a woman because apparently, we have it a lot easier than men. Okay.

If being paranoid means I'm going to get home alive, so be it. The world isn't a safe place. For anyone. Acting like it is makes you a fool. I will continue to lock every door and window of my car and house, I won't go out alone at night, I won't put bumper stickers or decoration on my car that gives away I'm a girl, I won't give out my personal information or make conversation with strangers, and I'll carry pepper spray. I'm not going to be lied to and told that trafficking and everything else that happens to us is a myth and I have no right to fear people. Women didn't start this.

Edit: thanks for all the comments. It feels so validating knowing that so many of us feel this way and that the men arguing with me truly are just clueless.

Why do men follow women? ,"I was followed for the first time today. (20F)

Out with my family around 10ish in the night, me and my sister stood back to take some pictures. We were in the city centre, so it was pretty crowded. A lot going on. 

This guy makes eye contact with me, he looked very young, was maybe 23-27. He was behind me and my sister. But kept stopping everytime we stopped, and carried on walking when we were.

And then my sister ran up to my dad, mum, brother and was panicking saying this guy is following us. He stopped and moved to the side and watched us the whole time, making eye contact with me specifically. He then started texting. Then my dad made eye contact with him, stared him down and he stopped following us. I assume he thought me and my sister were alone because we were far behind from my family.

Why tf do men do this? Was he trying to rape us, rob us? What has your experience been? 

I'm still pretty spooked out. Just from the possibilities of what could have happened if we were genuinely alone. Stabbed, robbed, raped, trafficked, I don't know what his intentions were. I could have had my life change drastically based on circumstance.

We were on the way to the car park. If we were alone, he could of just knocked both of us the fuck out and then could have killed us or something. 

Wonder how they pick their victims. Me and my sister are both petite. Maybe we don't look physically intimidating due to this? He was kind of small himself. Maybe like 5'7? And we're a lot smaller than that. What can I do about that?

It makes me sad. Thank god for my dad. Am I only ever safe if I have a man with me?

Thank you to the men and boys who recognize the dangerous positions women can find themselves in and help us without question.,"I was reminded of this by the other post today about a young woman having to assess her risks in asking an adult male stranger for help or being beaten up by a group that was following her. When she saw kids in the car she made a judgement call that this guy could help her and she was right. Thanks to a man who saw a sketchy situation and waited for the young woman to come to him rather than approach her and scare her off. 

I was coming home from a friend's house really late on Friday night. I took a cab of course for safety since it was past 3 am. The driver was nice, family guy with pics of his kids and wife in his car. We chatted on the 10 minute drive. 

When we got to my building there were 2 sketchy looking guys standing right by the entrance to the path that goes to our front door. They were standing on either side of the opening, looking like they were just chatting but I felt off about it. 

As I grabbed my bags from the trunk these two guys never took their eyes off me but kept acting like they were talking to eachother. I leaned over to the driver and whispered ""can you watch an wait until I get inside the building to leave?"" And he said "" already planning to, do you want me to walk you to the door?"" And he did! The sketchy dudes cleared off as soon as they saw he wasn't leaving me alone.

Does anyone else ever get annoyed about how clueless men really are about how scary it is to be a woman?,"As a woman no matter where we are, the mall, work, the grocery store, a party, OUR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD, we are constantly scared of being assaulted or kidnapped. The other day the second I got in my car I locked the doors and my boyfriend said something along the lines of “you’re being paranoid” and it made me realize how little he understands. You cannot truly understand how scary it is to be a woman just minding her own damn business walking down the street unless you are one. It makes me feel so bitter that men don’t have to experience that constant fear, so much so that they can’t even begin to comprehend why I might lock my doors when i get into my car, or only wear one headphone while i’m walking in broad daylight, or not want to go to the grocery store alone.

I'm really tired of seeing men compare the fear of being mugged/robbed to the experience of living life as a woman ,"I know this isn't breaking news, but I've recently seen an uptick in the ""men are afraid to walk alone at night, too!!"" argument and it just highlights how much men do not understand. 

Yes. We know men are afraid of being injured or killed while being robbed, or ending up on the wrong side of a drunk at a bar. Nobody has ever claimed *only* women are afraid to walk alone at night, or that the fear of sustaining physical injury due to malignant actors is solely women's domain. 

It's so much more complex and nuanced than that. 

First, it *is* about what we are afraid of, that's true. But women don't shove their keys in between their knuckles or ask to be walked out to their car after work bc we're afraid Mr. Robber McRobberson is going to punch us in the face and take our purse, or even kill us and take our purse. 
We are afraid they will hurt us in ways not one single person should ever be hurt. We are afraid they will strip us of our agency and our dignity and our humanity along with our autonomy. We are afraid they will kidnap us, and sexually torture us before they finally kill us. It is a fear that hangs out in the back of our minds, and permeates the rules we follow: get an escort to your car, don't walk at night with ear buds in, don't put decals on your car that indicate you're a woman. 

And yes, those are extreme cases, and ofc not every woman walks around terrified that Ted Bundy 2.0 will target them all of the time. But the very experience of being a woman adds a layer to it, bc we aren't just afraid of those things. 

While this may seem frivilous to some, we are ""afraid"" beyond that, in ways many men do not experience--the man at the bus stop who sees yoir discomfort and badgers you to go out with him, the man in the elevator who looks at you lile you're a piece of meat and he's a starving carnivore, the man at the gym who demands you take your earbuds out so he can inform you of all the ways in which you're working out wrong. We're afraid of being harassed, of being objectified, of our agency and autonomy being disrespected.

It is this constant and persistent objectification, this tendency by many men to ignore all signs of a woman's discomfort, this pervasive sense of being ""prey"" that truly wears us down. 

So, yes. Men are afraid to walk alone at night, too. We get it. 

But y'all are afraid of losing your wallet and your pride. We're afraid of losing our humanity. ",TwoXChromosomes,779,1724600454.0,95,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1f0z98y/im_really_tired_of_seeing_men_compare_the_fear_of/

"Just go screamed at by a normal seeming dude, still feel shaken up","There was a recent thread about how different women’s experiences are. I’m one of those that is usually left alone, I’ve been told by friends that I’m extremely unapproachable to strangers, like there’s a force field around me. I don't know why I'm writing this out, but I just need reassurance I suppose that this is fine, I'll be fine.

Well, I just went to get cash at an ATM. Just moved, super tired, new city. The ATM is stupidly positioned, it’s in a quiet side street, there’s a huge temporary (construction?) structure positioned behind it, so you’ve basically got the approach to the ATM, and then you’re blocked in from three sides.

A guy was sitting in this approach section. I eyed him as I walked to the ATM and weighed whether I should use it or not. He looked normal enough, late 20s or early 30s, wearing headphones, sitting there chilling while it’s raining. So I thought he’s having lunch or just waiting out the rain.

He speaks to me while I’m at the fricking ATM. “How’s your day, good? Despite the weather?” and so on. I don’t really engage, just say fine, look back at the ATM. He keeps talking “yeah, thank you, I’m having a nice day too, and whatever you’re thinking right now, same to you”.

So here’s my mistake, as I walk away I tell him “that’s really the wrong place to talk to people” and wish him a nice day. Then walk away. He takes off his headphones, all “what, what?”, and then started the abuse “what’s your damage, stupid bitch, what’s your problem” and “bitch, bitch” and “fuck you, go fuck yourself” at the top of his voice. Luckily he remained seated, I just walked over to the nearest store, entered, and when the bus arrived left the store and quickly got in, making sure he’s nowhere close by.

That’s it. First super crappy experience. I feel shaken up and honestly threatened, even though I know it’s not reasonable. He doesn’t know where I live and I’ll likely avoid that part of the city for a while. I’m in Switzerland, never had any issues, walked home in the middle of the night. This was new, I know it’s all about him, nothing to do with me, but what gets me is that he looked absolutely norma, until he started talking, and he likely reacted to me not being all smiley at him. I feel I did nothing wrong, yet now I will be the one avoiding that area and hoping to never encounter him again.

Edit: Shoutout to the user who sent me this private message. You're a hypocrite.

""Maybe mind your own business, when it's absolutely clear he meant no harm and was just making nice small talk to a stranger. You're not an authority figure to him. You're not his mom. You can't tell him what to do. Pick your battles better. It I was just trying to be nice to someone and they seemingly told me not to talk to them. I would think that to be highly rude and offensive. Just say hi back and leave. You ain't some moral authority up on her high horse. Be a person.""

Edit2: Thanks everyone for your comments and kindness. After sleeping it over I'm fine now. I know the event had nothing to do with me but I just needed to work it out of my system.

A couple notes regarding people's questions:

- the guy was sitting about 3-4m away from the ATM (not 10m, I was still in a state when I wrote that)  
- he started to talk to me once I had my hand in my backpack, so was ""locked in"" in a sense  
- I didn't write down everything he said because I didn't parse it, I was concentrated on the transaction and on keeping myself safe  
- I'm in a country where smalltalk is not a thing, people who do it will be considered suspicious or unhinged  
- I don't think he was homeless or mentally ill, but I am not in a capacity to judge honestly  
- he was treated with the same politeness and in the same manner I show everyone else. I didn't curse him out, make faces at him, enhance body language or anything. I just politely told him an ATM might not be the best area to chat up people. That's it. This is the first negative response I received to my behavior, I will not modify it because of him.   
- even if he were homeless, it's a temporary state, not a personality trait. It wouldn't change my treatment of of a person for this, all humans are equal until proven distrustful. 

Finally, why am I still justifying myself? Instinct to blame myself, I suppose, and overwhelm at the amount of engagement this post received. This topic is closed for me now, though.

This post just got blocked on unpopular opinions for being too “political”,"Online dating is a fantastic invention and we shouldn’t go back - not because women have “all the choice and can flock to Chad” but because you can avoid (more of) the assholes and stay safe(r)

The reason: it allows you to screen people out. I’m in my thirties, I know I don’t need my SOs to be six feet tall or conventionally attractive (I’ve never dated anyone tall?) But I DO need people who are kind and patient and who are going to respect that I’m bi, that I have a pretty high powered career, and that I have no plans to give up either. 

You’re a short or middling height person of any gender identity and any gender expression with any body type, with maybe a job but definitely a sense of humor and some patience? Sold. Artists, gamers, programmers, creatives, people working “just a job”? All great. 

You write nothing in your profile, have “traditional family values”, are looking for a unicorn, expect to be the breadwinner, are politically apathetic, are opposed to abortion rights, or feel it’s your God given right to have my attention? Great for me to learn that early, we can just be two ships passing in the night and no one’s time is wasted. 

In my twenties, I thought I had to be polite and give at least some time to people (generally cis men) who approached me. Online? Nope, I’m not replying to your d*** pic or aggressive sexual solicitation, I can just block you and move on with my day, and you’re not following me stating that you’re a nice guy if only I gave you a chance. 

I also have a picture of you before we meet up and can text it to a friend for safety. 

With women? We’re not doing the awkward are you romantically interested in women dance, ha, it’s great. 

Caveat: I acknowledge online harassment can still be a drag, would recommend Bumble to all women whether trans or cis. Yeah, online dating can be exhausting and demoralizing, but for me? Not as exhausting as agreeing to go on a date and then finding out my date is kind of racist and wants five kids.",TwoXChromosomes,1003,1664748300.0,146,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/xu1a8t/this_post_just_got_blocked_on_unpopular_opinions/
My ex is re-imagining my abortion online with half-truths and lies. It feels like he is taking that event from me. I have a chance to bring this up at an event in my state. Should I even bother?,"I don't even know if this is the right place. My ex and I no longer speak. It has been two years. Two long and peaceful years since the tragic 3 months we found ourselves together. I am growing as a person, learning, refocusing on me.

My abortion was a deep mixture of emotions. I am firmly pro-choice and the thought of abortion doesn't make me uncomfortable. 

My ex is an avid male redditor and pretty out spoken on most social media. 

I avoid looking. He is basically doesn't exist to me anymore and I like it that way. 

My abortion was hard for me. It was hard on my body. Although, I would have eventually made the choice to have an abortion on my own, he forced me to make a decision fairly quickly ( I knew early on as I had some unusual medical symptoms very early). It was either do this or his life is over for him. Which I understood.

I agreed without getting a chance to really think about it or talk it over or take my time to reach my own decision. I was butt-hurt about it. Mostly at myself for allowing that to happen. It made me feel like a child. 

We live in a smaller, big town so everyone sort of knows everyone. I stumbled upon a few posts he made as he is vehemently pro choice (but really he is just pro abortion when he wants it) about his run in with an abortion clinic on the exact date of my abortion date. How there were lines and lines of picketers, how he helped his traumatized girlfriend fend off the anger of one who had the nerve to get in her face, how he bravely held my hand while I set through people telling me not to do it. How I had to view pictures of the ultrasound, etc. How I almost caved but he encouraged me to stand by my convictions. 

Well, he never mentioned my name but unless he went to two abortions that day (not even time) then he was using my experience as a platform to inflate his own ego. 

It angers me because zero of that was true. There were zero picketers when we went. The nurse that I asked said they usually only get them on special days when a local church or someone else decides to get everyone together to picket. Even then she said they aren't allowed on the property. They stand on the street, they can't come through the big fence. So you pull through and the gates closes and they can't see you and you can't see them. And they have never personally had any problems with protesters getting in anyone's face. She said most are keep it clean and civil. There are a few that are over the top but most would never approach the women.Maybe she was just saying that to make me feel better but my two follow ups where I went alone went over without any picketing. 

He never held my hand or gave me support. He was purely focused on me just getting it done. He brought a book in the waiting room, sat in a corner and never said anything really. Not to me or to anyone. I never had to watch any videos and the nurses and aids at the clinic were nothing but supportive of my decision/ needs.They held my hand, they asked me what I really wanted, told me what I needed to know. It was true that they were required to do an ultrasound but just to see how far along I was. I was asked if I wanted to look at the screen or not. I declined and she smiled and turned it away from me. She didn't ask me if I wanted to know how far along I was. They let me dictate what I wanted to know. 

It was tough and I cried. They said it was pretty normal. 

All of it was done in one day. I had to come back the next day just for a simple blood test to see if my hormone level was dropping. Then 4 weeks later for a check up. That was it. It was oddly simple for me, although I know for other women it is much harder depending on the area and how far along you are.   

The procedure was done and over and he drove me home. He didn't stay for the hours he claimed to make sure I was alright. He didn't stand up for anything he claimed. He high-jacked my experience.     

I feel angry, not enough to break my non contact with him but angry that he took an experience that was mine and made himself the hero. 

It took something away from me. Every time I see someone share what he claims is his experience with abortion in the ""backwards"" south, I get angry. It wasn't his experience. Sure, he has an experience tied to it. I am not taking away that he shouldn't have emotions tied to it. 

 It was mine too though and he is perverting it for his own ego. 

It is gross. 

I've been asked to speak at a event for women in the south and their experiences with things such as abortion, domestic violence, etc. 

I am not sure if this is even worth bringing up since he will likely be at the same event (given his sudden activism with abortion, he will have a booth there. He retells that story a lot of that particular day that just happens to be the exact same day as my abortion as the tipping point of what got him into activism). I don't want to take the focus away from the issues but I also think it would good to bring up to the women and men there that each experience is unique and it is your own and that having someone take that away from you can be a problem. Misinformation can cause a lot of problems.

Loss of Innocence,"My daughter is 16. Short, skinny, good looking. Today she was at a gas station to grab something to eat and a man in his 50's or 60's tried to grab her outside, then followed her inside repeating ""I just want to say hi and get to know you"" as he tried to get ahold of her. Her friend inside the gas station (a boy) had to physically shove the guy away from her. The guy then went outside and climbed in the truck with 2 other guys. Her ""friend"" told her she'd be fine and to just go to her truck, and said no when she asked him to walk her out. Dipshit.

She called me, scared and crying. She really thought she was going to be kidnapped. She was terrified. I've never heard that fear in her voice. But I recognized it from experience. I have been assaulted more times than I'd like, and had countless other creepy encounters. The best part about reaching my late 30's and putting on a little weight is that it doesn't happen as often. After an encounter with an 80 year old man ( I was six months pregnant and had my 2 year old by my side)- I vowed to never be alone with another man that wasn't my husband or father. And the incidents stopped for the most part, at least the physical ones.

I've warned her for years. Trying to tell her enough to be aware and wary, but age appropriate and trying not to terrify her of men for life. It's such a hard balance. And in a way I'm grateful, because she had the ""I'm 16 and invincible"" attitude- but now she doesn't. I know it  could have been so much worse and I am so grateful she wasn't harmed- but what the fuck??? She told me she was just wearing jeans a tshirt, so why did he mess with her? That's what the world tells her- it's our own fault, we must have been asking for it. Now she knows. And now she's scared.

IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS!!! I told her the next 10/15 years are going to be the worst. This probably won't be the last time it happens to her. And it breaks my fucking heart so fucking much. I hate this. I hate being a woman sometimes. I hate that I can't protect her or stop it from happening. I hate that they do this to us.

For the record, I know it's not all men. I have been happily married almost 18 years. But even my husband doesn't understand. Unless you've been there and experienced it, you don't understand the pure terror and feeling of helplessness. I hope this is the only time she has an experience like this. I would give anything for it to be. But it's probably not. And that's the most fucked up part.

Update: I called the Sheriff's Dept to find out what we should do after she called me. The Sheriff was there at the school within minutes and interviewed her. They got footage from the gas station. They didn't have him on camera physically assaulting her so they don't think they'll be able to arrest him for anything, but they did trespass him from the store for a year and the sheriff said he would talk to the man and make sure it didn't happen again. I'm thankful they took her seriously, and they were quick to act. That's something at least.

Unlearning: A Message to My Daughter,"I need to remember what I’ve learned, so that I know what I need to unlearn. For her.

\-

When I was four years old, I remember answering the door without a shirt on. My grandma was watching me and my brothers at home. I guess she invited some guy over. Afterwards, I remember being scolded for letting a man see my bare chest. 

I learned that something is wrong with my body. That it needs to be covered and that I’m bad if it isn’t.

\-

I remember this same grandma sarcastically replying to my young pleadings for candy and toys with: “How do you plan to pay for them? With your good looks?” 

I learned that being pretty can get me what I want.

\-

I remember being told by smiling strangers that my big brown eyes were sure to cause trouble for my dad. I remember being told that I’d need to “fight off” boys. 

I learned that boys are dangerous, but that to be wanted by them is a good thing.

\-

I remember my mom refusing to leave the house before “putting on her face.” I remember thinking that was a funny thing to say—that she didn’t have a face without makeup.

I remember when I started shaving my legs. I asked my mom how often she shaved hers. She said every day. 

I learned that it’s important to *always* look your best, and that you’re not really you unless you’re the best-looking version of you.

\-

I remember hearing and sharing countless “your mama’s so fat” jokes in elementary school. I remember hearing my stepdad tell cruder versions to his friends. 

I learned that being fat is such a bad thing that it can bring shame to your family. 

\-

When I was ten years old, I remember wearing my mom’s high school cheerleading uniform for Halloween. It was perfect, her school colors were orange and black. I remember outgrowing it within two years and feeling embarrassed and resentful toward anyone smaller than me, including my own mother. 

I remember this sentiment being shared amongst my friends, with a popular attitude of “She’s perfect. I hate her.”

I learned that to acknowledge another girl’s beauty somehow detracts from my own. 

\-

I remember spending a hot, summer weekend at my dad’s house when I was eleven years old. My little brother and sister were playing outside in the sprinkler and I’d put on my two-piece bathing suit to join them. I remember my stepmom looking at the hair on my lower back in disgust and telling me that she’d wax it if she were me. I later remember the fixation I developed, crying as I wrote about it in my diary and vowing to save my babysitting dollars to get laser hair removal.

I learned that girls aren’t supposed to have any body hair and that getting rid of it is a top priority.

\-

I remember my mom asking for “just a small bite” of the numerous birthday cakes, bowls of ice cream, and after dinner desserts we had throughout my childhood. But I never remember her having her own helping. Some of her go-to ‘treats’ were rice cakes and a few tootsie rolls. She was incredibly disciplined with her diet. 

I remember wanting to emulate her discipline. When I felt desperate, I remember wanting to starve myself. I didn’t want an eating disorder *per se,* but I wanted to know that I had enough power to stop eating–just to shed those few extra pounds. I remember being hungry and finally giving in. I remember feeling shame that I was too weak to control my body.

One time I asked my mom what she thought heaven was like. I remember a huge smile crossing her face as she described a place full of food. She said that in heaven you can eat whatever you want without gaining any weight.

I learned that food is a temptation like other vices—meant to be overcome through willpower and discipline. A failure to be fit is a failure of character.

\-

When I was in middle school, I remember hearing about ‘model weight.’ This was the supposed weight limit if you wanted to be a professional model. I didn’t want to be a model, but I wanted to look like one. I remember forever trying to stay under 110 lbs. and never achieving my goal. I remember lying about my weight for years.

I learned that I’d rather pretend to be the ideal weight than to be honest.

\-

I remember being thirteen and trying on a new bikini I’d bought from a Victoria Secret magazine. I remember bursting into tears because I thought it made me look fat. My mom saw how upset I was and tried to help. She offered advice: always burn more calories than you eat. I remember creating a notebook to track everything I consumed. I remember cutting out photos from fashion magazines of thin women and making a collage on the cover for motivation. I remember showing it to my mom and her smiling in approval.

I learned that dieting is the answer to a thinner, happier life.

\-

I remember staying the night at my grandma’s apartment. I must have been around twelve years old. I remember her watching some true crime show about violent rape. She told me to pay attention, because it wasn’t a matter of *if* I’d be raped one day, but *when*. 

I learned to be terrified of men. I learned to protect myself by doing my best to always appease them. 

\-

I remember being asked several times by boys in high school if I still had my virginity, or “v-card” as we called it. When I said yes, there was always a smile or nod of approval. I also remember being pressured by some of those same boys to have sex.

I learned that there’s almost nothing as valuable as staying a virgin if you’re a girl, and almost nothing worse if you’re a guy. 

\-

I remember being sexually harassed at school. In sixth grade, it got so bad that I began skipping recess and tried to report the boy to the teacher. I was told I should be flattered and to just ignore him. 

During my junior year, I stopped going to my first period early to avoid the boy who sat on my desk each morning awaiting my arrival. I actively hid from him in the halls and was constantly on the lookout to avoid him during lunch and after school. I don’t remember ever telling him to leave me alone. I think I was afraid it’d make things worse –at least he was friendly when he harassed me. 

I remember being sexually harassed at work. I remember hiding in storage closets and walk-in freezers when certain customers arrived. I remember my colleagues covering for me and saying I wasn’t there. 

I remember one of my coworkers offering me his entire paycheck if I’d give him a lap dance. 

I learned it is normal behavior to be harassed as a female—and that it is something I should tolerate, or even welcome, because it means I’m attractive. 

\-

I remember being seventeen and working my evening shift at a waterfront restaurant as a hostess. It was a slow evening, and an older couple came in. I sat them near the window. The wife immediately left to use the restroom. I proceeded to ask her husband if he’d like water and bread. As I turned around to fetch them, I remember him slapping my ass. I remember feeling flushed with embarrassment and trying to convince myself that he must have meant to pat me on the small of my back. I kept walking. A middle-aged server grabbed my arm as she passed me and sternly whispered into my ear, “Never let a man touch you like that again.” I remember muttering “okay” while my embarrassment flared into a burning shame.

I learned that I *let* this happen to me and that it was my fault if men touched me in inappropriate ways. I learned that it is my responsibility, not theirs, to stop this type of behavior.

\-

In college, I remember trying to be “one of the guys” by telling sexist jokes and degrading other women. I remember talking trash about sorority girls and saying things like, “I’m glad I’m a girl so that I never have to date one.” I remember feeling proud when the guys I was around laughed. 

I learned that putting other women down is rewarded.

\-

I remember countless diets. Veganism, keto, fasting, juicing, and so on. I remember trying to exercise more—joining gyms, kickboxing clubs, and yoga studios. I remember feeling elated when I’d lose a couple of pounds. And I remember falling out of my routine repeatedly as life happened; as I moved, travelled, started graduate school, and got pregnant. I remember feeling like a failure. 

I remember telling my mom that I was going to start trying for a baby and her advising me that July was a good time to get pregnant because I could wear a bikini before showing, then have the baby, and then lose the weight before it was summer again. 

I remember telling our family that we were expecting and immediately hearing about weight—how much my mother-in-law had gained with each pregnancy and how I’d likely never lose it all. I remember my father-in-law jokingly asking me if I could fit back into my jeans when my baby girl was only a few weeks old.

I learned that we measure health based on how our bodies look.

\-

I remember last week when I looked at my body with despair just two months post-partum. Then I remember that my body created, birthed, and is sustaining a healthy little human. I remember that I have a child and that whether I intend it or not, she’ll learn from me. She’ll watch, she’ll listen, and she’ll learn.

I’ve learned that it’s time to unlearn so much. It’s time to unlearn that harassment is normal and okay and start calling it out. It’s time to unlearn that other women are competition and start actively supporting them. It’s time to unlearn that we’re responsible for the actions of boys and men; it’s time to unlearn fear by expecting better and holding them accountable. It’s time to unlearn that worth is linked to looks; that health and happiness are likened to body size and beauty.

Ladies we need one another more than ever.,"Edit: I see the men who peruse this subreddit are offended and downvoting. I posted this comment first in a different subreddit discussing how a woman on her first date was drugged, gangraped and left for dead behind a dumpster in an area shed never been to and surprise surprise its not being downvoted. **The men in this sub need to fuck right off. Women absolutely need to discuss how the fuck this shit type of violence against us happens.**

Men dont sit there huddled in groups openly admitting the violent atrocities they fantasize about comitting against women.

They start with tiny comments that dehumanize women. That progresses into long running jokes about womens sexuality and bodies.

They test the waters this way. The men who respond well to this they then bond together over their general disdain for women, sharing stories of ex wives and girlfriends, sisters and mothers, aunts and coworkers, women who rejected them. All the stories share 1 common factor which is that the men are painted as fair and just and right, the women are painted as whores and clowns and villans, useless fecks.

The underlying theme is always women have what men want and cant have and its not fair or right that women have bodily autonomy and then choose to avoid these men somehow.

They share media, porn, and fantasies eventually about getting even, taking what they want from women.

The group narrows to eventually only be men whom all agree broadly that something can and should be done to get what they believe they deserve from women while also degrading and shaming, punishing women for their choices.

Thats when the planning can make an entrance. The fantadtical talk suddenly becomes an idea shared and plans start entering the tweaking phase.

The small group collaborates and then its a hunt to find the right victim to execute their machinations.

Its never just from the get go men proudly sharing a handshake openly planning to violate another human being violently.

It takes time to fester and brew and the men who would never engage in this must be weeded out. Sometimes this process takes years. Sometimes its a matter of months. It depends on how fast they can weed out the men who wouldnt be interested from those who would and all it takes is one loud mouthed leader to escalate things.

The truth is MANY men whom we as women think we are safe around would absolutely never admit to the fact that they would LOVE to sexually violate and or torture women if they knew for a fact that 1 nobody they respect would find out and 2 there would be absolutely zero consequences if anyone they respected did find out.

Women need to listen to theirs guts and anticipate that men can and will harm them. No amount of trust can protect us.

If theyre that guy, then youre at risk.

Tells women can pay attention to will be generalized misogyny in the form of jokes or comments or the absence of protest to others making egregious jokes and comments about women.

Men who arent interested in violating women dont feel comfortable when other men make statements that inherently lead down the path Ive described. These men have been men long enough to see what other men want to do to us. Theres weeding out sessions everywhere they turn. Even unconciously men know wtf men really mean and wtf men are capable of.

Everyone and I mean it...EVERYONE knows at least 2 dudes who would gladly rape a bitch and dump her behind a garbage bin, whether we know it or not. These men are far from uncommon. These men are everywhere. Presenting as good guys.

Err on the side of caution ladies, theyre everywhere. The more misogyny is normalized, the more women are marginalized, the less autonomy we have the more emboldened these men are. Its not a coincidence, its these men wanting to hop out of their dark closets and be free to use and abuse us as they see fit.

We are a commodity they seek to consume, not people. Dont forget it, dont let your gaurd down. Consider dating in groups rather than alone. Like double dating or group meet date for trivia night ect.

Alone we are easy to peck off. We need eachother more than ever.",TwoXChromosomes,638,1718898395.0,79,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1dkevtv/ladies_we_need_one_another_more_than_ever/
Should I be worried about this guy or am I just overthinking? He's making me super uncomfortable.,"EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your responses, I'm going to go with my gut on this and tell my supervisor next week when I see her. She's always made it clear that I can go to her if I'm having any concerns and I think she'll be able to help me deal with this situation (I'm pretty new at this place and the working world in general, this is my first real job actually, so I'm not very experienced in how all of this works and how to make reports and such). Will update this afterwards, I think. 

One of the security guards at my place of work is currently making me feel the exact opposite of secure.

At first he seemed fine, greeting me in the mornings when I arrived at work and saying goodbye as I left in the evening. Sometimes he'd make a little small talk, about the weather, or the weekend, but other than that I didn't talk much with him.

One day, when I was leaving, he was waiting outside for me, and gestured for me to come over to him... he then proceeded to give me his number. I didn't know how to deal with this situation at all, I was too nervous to say no, I didn't want to be rude. I took his number, but did not contact him. Once I got home I realized that the spot he had been waiting for me was... unusual. Security guards don't tend to be positioned in that spot - they stand by the entrances to the building. This guy was nowhere near an entrance. He was on a corner, where the building meets the street, around the back of the building. I thought this was... weird. But put it down to me overthinking things as I tend to do. 

I was worried about going to work in the morning for the following days, knowing he was likely to be there at the entrance... and he was eventually gonna ask why I hadn't called. I tried my best to avoid him. Luckily on the times I did run into him, he didn't bring it up. Maybe he got the message that I wasn't interested, I thought??? 

Now....this week, I did not see him at all. Up until now I had been seeing him at work almost every day. I figured he must be on a vacation or sick or something, and was honestly kinda relieved that he wasn't there.

Until today. I left work today, and as I was walking up the (very quiet!!) street on the side of the building, I heard someone calling my name. I turned around and he's parked on the side of the fucking road and he gestures for me to come over to him. Absolutely not, there is no way I'm going to approach a stranger's vehicle. I yelled over to him, ""Sorry but I'm in a hurry, need to catch my bus!"" and quickly walked away. As far as I could tell, he wasn't in his uniform (the bright jackets the guards usually wear). And hadn't been working that day. What on earth was he doing there?? Was he a seriously there waiting for me?? I was actually really scared at this point and got paranoid that he would follow me... (he didn't, thank god..)

But... wtf.... Was he trying something? Or was he just completely oblivious how creepy that was?????? I don't know what to think.

I don't know if I'm overthinking this, if I'm making a big deal out of nothing. But I don't feel so safe. This guy is freaking me out. I'm scared that he'll do this again or worse. Or maybe he's just a genuinely nice guy but completely oblivious??? I don't know.

I guess I'm looking for some perspective, some other opinions. Is his behaviour creepy, should I be worried?? Or am I being dramatic?? Am I being an asshole here???? What do I do? I'm freaking out.

“Women who wear that kind of top are asking for men to look”,"I live on the other side of the country from my parents so I don’t see them often.  They are in town visiting and we all went to the pool. I am wearing a low-cut swimsuit (lower than usual for me), but nothing too crazy. I was sitting with my dad by the pool. A man walked by and took a long look at me and kind of gestures to his own chest area and said “boy, I’d like to get inside there!” (Inside my top, I guess?) I felt embarrassed. After the man passed and a few more awkward moments of silence later, I said “well that was awkward” just to say something I guess. 

My dad replied, “well, you are looking for attention like that. Women who wear that kind of swimsuit top are asking men to look.” I fell silent. I didn’t know what to say. I went to the bathroom and started crying. Now I’m so embarrassed to be wearing this and I don’t think I can handle being around my dad the rest of the week. I expected…better from him, I guess? I just was having a good day and now feel so shitty because of these two men.

Edit: ooookay, my dad must have said something to my mom. She just asked me if there was a way to take a safety pin and close my top more securely. She said “it looks like you’re trying too hard with how it is.” I don’t think I can stand to be around either of them another second. I feel so awkward, humiliated, slutty….and angry at them.

Edit: thank you everyone for the kind words! Some interesting discussions came up. A lot of people said it’s fine to look but not comment. I agree, but this man was leering, and that is never okay IMO. Some of you said I should not let other people affect me or bring me down. I am human. I am also in therapy to get better at this exact thing, so I’m working on it! (This situation is just a glimpse into my upbringing, so I have a lot to unlearn)

I talked to my brother on the phone last night who is a big supporter. I told him I am putting down strict guidelines my parents have to follow if they want to keep seeing me. If they don’t follow those, I will cut off contact. I am scared to do this but also kind of excited? Thank you for all the help in the comments.

I'm afraid to be home and I'm afraid to be out in public.,"Edit: thank you for all of your kind, compassionate, and supportive responses. Except one of you and the person who sent a ""reddit cares.""

I've been married to a wonderful man for almost 9 years. He's a lefty, feminist, voted for Kamala, and while he *was* prone to some willfull incompetence (which he's really improved on because he actually gave a shit when I brought it up), he's a wonderful man, partner, and dog-dad. He got fixed (vasectomy) so we could avoid pregnancy after a IUD failure. I feel the most at peace and safe with him.

He's in the military (I know, I know... I never expected to meet a man who I could love who was a career military man but he's moved farther and farther left along with me over the years) and just became an officer, before the election happened. He just moved to his next duty station in another state and I'm staying here in the house until spring, which is historically the best time of year to sell where I live (PNW).

I'm alone in a big house in a rural area. It's a blue state but a red area. I have three dogs. If you have dogs, you're familiar with the ""barking at nothing"" they tend to do. But you can typically tell the difference between ""barking at nothing"" and barking at something actually happening. 

The other night, when I was not expecting, there was a loud thunk at my door. It's November in the PMW so it was DARK outside. All of the dogs started barking ferociously and I was terrified. Especially when I looked out my front door and saw someone standing at it. I almost had a true proper panic attack until I realized it was Amazon making a delivery. Everything was fine.

Today, I had to go to the grocery store(s) and people on the roads were extra impatient and two people honked at me for not endangering myself to pull into traffic for their convenience. I was afraid they'd have guns or something, so I changed my route to avoid holding either up anymore. 

After this fucking election, I'm terrified. 

Seeing everything online - what men are saying to women, the texts Black people are receiving, other people of color being targeted even harder than usual immediately, knowing what I do about Project 25...

I voted for her. My husband voted for her. All the close friends I keep voted for her. I encouraged everyone who would listen to me to vote (I don't keep company with anyone who would vote for the orange man).

What else could I/we have done?

I'm terrified to be home alone. I'm terrified to be out in public alone. I'm terrified for the next few years. I'm terrified for the next few decades as a result of the next few years. I could go on and on and on about everything I'm terrified of.

And for chaos' sake, I'm a cis white woman who does not outwardly look disabled. I cannot imagine how terrified women of color and disabled women feel in the face of all of this.

To the stranger who cared about my safety: thank you.,"A couple of nights ago I was on my way home from a babysitting job. By the time I finished up it had been dark for a few hours, but I was in such a ""safe"" neighborhood that I wasn't worried. I was walking alone back to my car (parked barely a block away) when I noticed that another car had stopped up the block from me and was idling in the middle of the street. The driver did not move until I had reached my car and gotten inside, at which point they immediately drove past me and went on their way. I saw the driver (a middle-aged woman) and realized that she had been using her headlights to illuminate the street so that I wouldn't have to walk alone in the dark. 

Even though it was a relatively small gesture in the grand scheme of things, I was incredibly touched by what this stranger did for me. I know that there is an incredibly low chance that I will ever be able to thank her personally, so I wanted to reach out and share with all of you. To everyone who takes the time to look out for the well-being of strangers, thank you.",TwoXChromosomes,1929,1501219414.0,156,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6q1qun/to_the_stranger_who_cared_about_my_safety_thank/
"In a dark and deeply emotional state, I called the after abortion hotline: Exhale. All counselors were busy. I waited and called again. And called again. And called again. Until the receiptionist told me they couldn't help me.","I took misoprostol three weeks ago, effectively terminating my very early pregnancy. I had never been pregnant before and this whole experience has shook me to my core. 

I want to have children one day but I'm young, two years into my career and in a new city without family or friends. I told my partner as soon as I found out and he was very supportive, accompanying me on my first trip to Planned Parenthood to weight our options. But there was only one choice for him and it was termination. In all honesty, it's what I wanted too.

But as soon as I took the misoprostol, he disappeared. Ghosted me. That hurt beyond words. A few friends knew about my recent decision and have offered guidance. But no one understood the pain and grief I'm going through. Somehow, this bundle of cells has changed me forever. 

So last night, I found myself alone in my apartment and very depressed. A thought of suicide even crossed my mind. Scared to be alone with my own thoughts, I remembered Exhale and thought it might be a good time to give them a call. 

So I did. The receiptionist told me all counselors were engaged and to call back in 30 mins. Annoyed but understanding, I hung up and played on my phone for a while to distract me. I called back again. Same receiptionist, same reply. A little defeated, I decided I'd call back if I couldn't fall asleep. But my thoughts were running rampid. I called once more and received the same reply from the receiptionist. At this point, I was sobbing and just asked ""Please, I'm in emotional distress. I need someone to talk to. Can't I just wait on hold?"" 

With which the receiptionist replied ""Ma'am, there's nothing we can do to help you. You'll just have to call back at a different time or a different day."" 

I was shell shocked. I have wonder about this receiptionist's training, considering how emotional and raw women are calling in. 

It's difficult for people suffering with grief to ask for help. It's even more difficult when the people who are supposed to help us say they can't. 

UPDATE: Thank you all for the support. I was able to schedule an emergency appointment with my therapist today. I haven't stopped reaching out for help. I think with everything happening in the world today, it's important to not stop asking. 

UPDATE 2: I appreciate all the overwhelming support I have received! I am trying to respond to each message because you all have been so important to me. I never thought strangers would make me feel so loved. Bless you all.

I guess I saved someone’s life today?,"That feels absurd to say, but I guess in a very real and literal sense that’s what happened. I don’t know who else to tell, but this group of gals and pals are the most supportive community I know on this site, so here we are. 

We were having a big potluck lunch at work and I’ve only been there a month or two, so besides my immediate coworkers I don’t know most people. I walked into the empty break room to toss my plate. One of my coworkers was in there alone, but there’s maybe 60 of us in our department and I didn’t recognize her, so at first I didn’t plan to engage. We happened to make eye contact, and… shit. Her eyes were the size of dinner plates and she looked so panicked and was clearly trying to cough but just… couldn’t. 

Asked her if she was choking and she nodded, so I gave her the Heimlich. She coughed a bunch of food onto the floor, I came back to the front of her and asked if that was all of it and she shook her head, so I did the Heimlich again until the rest of it came up. 

She’s fine. I’m fine. But I feel so incredibly rattled even hours later, so I can’t imagine how she’s feeling. We walked back out into the hall where everyone else was and our big boss was giving a speech so we had to just stand there in silence with the rest of the employees. I kept looking at her to make sure she was okay, and every time I looked at her she was looking back at me too. After the speech and a round of jeopardy I was going to go back to my desk but the deputy director called me over and said that the woman had told her what happened. The deputy started talking about how I was a “hero” and took a few pictures of her and I together. 

Everyone is talking about how proud of myself I should be— one coworker even said she was “jealous” because she’d been a lifeguard but never got to use any of her first aid training. I feel sick. Like what if I hadn’t gone to toss my plate, what if i’d kept my head down and avoided eye contact like I usually do. What if i’d frozen. And I didn’t—luckily— but oh my god. I could’ve been the last person this woman saw today as she died an agonizing and terrifying death. A total stranger alone with her in the break room as 60 people she actually knew laughed and partied 20 feet away.  

It feels a lot less like “I saved someone’s life” and a lot more like “I almost watched a mother of four die today”. 

Choking isn’t like the movies. It’s silent and it’s fast. Don’t go get water, don’t walk away from people. Wave your arms, cause a scene, get attention immediately. Thank Christ I took that Red Cross babysitter’s class when I was 13 or I don’t know what I would’ve done today. 

Her and her husband went and bought me a bouquet of flowers that she brought me at my desk later in the afternoon— and as I look at them I just can’t stop thinking that I’m so grateful I’m not having to order lillies and chrysanthemums for her family.

EDIT: Thank you all for your words and support. My therapist left her practice back in August and I’m in a weird in-between where there wasn’t much point in finding someone new knowing that my insurance was about to change when I got this job and I wouldn’t be eligible for help from the someone at the same practice, so it’s been a few months without someone. But Nov 1 my insurance kicks in and it’s a priority to find someone new. 

Thank you for validating that my feelings about it are rational. I didn’t sleep as well as I could have last night, but waking up to these comments really helped. I sort of needed to just dump all of my thoughts into text, and if even one person took the time to refresh their knowledge of first aid or considered signing up for classes then I’m so glad I did.",TwoXChromosomes,1423,1697767459.0,67,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17c0300/i_guess_i_saved_someones_life_today/
Every man in the UK should watch Undercover Sexual Harassment,"Channel 4 aired a documentary last night where a reporter goes undercover to show the sexual harassment so many women go through every day. I just want to warn that some may be triggered, so you might want to google it before watching.

The reporter, Ellie Flynn, looks at sexual harassment from multiple angles. She spoke to teenagers, so many speaking of being sexually harassed at the age of 10. That wearing a school uniform actually made them more of a target even though that makes it even more obvious they are underaged.

She went onto dating apps and got harassed by men sending dick pics and videos after hardly talking to them and then confronted them. In what world do women want random dick pics from strangers? When is this ever a good idea? Do any of you ever want an unsolicited dick pic? The sense of entitlement some of these men have over women just because they claim to be “horny” is so gross. 

She was even followed by men randomly on the street who thought she was drunk so they could take advantage of her. 

This should be required viewing for so many men, to help them better understand what women go through. I’d recommend giving it a watch and maybe even encouraging your male friends to watch if you’re in the UK.",TwoXChromosomes,1158,1670954517.0,106,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/zl29c9/every_man_in_the_uk_should_watch_undercover/
I don't like celebrating my birthday but I still think my partner should not have done what he did yesterday,"Long story short I'm a Thanksgiving baby raised in a family where NPD runs rampant my birthday was always on Thanksgiving as to not inconvenience anyone and just combined into the family gathering every year no fail I didn't know my birthdays actual date until 7th grade where I was bullied and laughed at when a school counselor asked my birthday and became angry and concerned that I said it's always on Thanksgiving no matter how much they responded it wasn't possible. There were a few years presents were forgotten and those years my birthday was on Black Friday where 8 year old me was draged out to the Jersey City outlet mall to get my own gifts that had never been wrapped and in 2014 when my extended family cut off my immediate family because my mom attempted to break the cycle I never heard from them again and began having my birthday on the actual day but still ice cream cake forgotten in the garage to melt parties where I was told I was making the whole thing about me it left a taste in my mouth of having a birthday in the sense of recognizing and celebrating it was not worth it. 

In 2017 I met my partner right before going to college and I decided I would no longer have a birthday. I tell people who need to know and everyone else I just say oh I don't celebrate or share and most people move on. I have been with my partner since then and they always get me gifts and cards but never have done anything which is fine and just how I like it, but this year was different and I want to know if I'm in the wrong.

I am currently recovering with an unruptured brain aneurysm essentially swollen blood vessels in my brain impacting my vargus nerve which as made me incredibly sick since mid September. Also in thai time my workload has increased tenfold with some large name clients running their ads across the US on a national TV network and they have 0 sense or urgency or organization which has led to at least 10 hours of over time every week but closer to 50 the last four weeks handling the start of a new finical year. I moved into a building where my neighbors frequently smoke substances that trigger my allergies and I've been to the hospital twice for reactions since moving in. On top of that my mother got terrible news about some undetected spine damage she needs a surgery for in the next week. It's been the most trying few months of my life and my 25th birthday was just this looming weight I was dreading. I say to my partner hey my birthday is on a Saturday I'm definitely not working overtime I just want a clean apartment to be in to wear comfy PJs and put the futon in bed mode and take a really good shower and then have the option to nap or lounge anywhere I can whenever I can. With the anyeusm and work I feel like I'm showering every three days and only averaging 3 hours of sleep a night while getting sick having a day to recover was all I wanted.

We did the holiday separate with our families and on Friday my partner texts me ""hey since my mother and stepdad are up from Florida they want to come see the new apartment and the only day they can come is Saturday but it will be a short visit"" ...okay yeah sure I love my in-laws I understand it's a short visit last visit they came for 20 minutes I say since my mom's surgery is coming up I will have to wear a mask the whole time but it's fine. After I approve I get the text ""great also we blew a tire so we can't go home now till tomorrow rather than tonight""... Okay again not super controllable but we didn't blow a tire he did but it's fine I'll get home have the visit get to my plans. He sleeps in Saturday at his father's while I wait alone at my parents house for him unable to reach anyone until 1 pm then we finally get on the road to our apartment at 3 pm I say is the visit cancelled you know my plans are for today and why I wanted today he apologized and said the visits still happening it will be super quick. We get home at 4 pm and he says they were right behind us so I stayunshowered straightening up the apartment that I cleaned for my relaxing day but to my standards not to having guests standards. They don't arrive until 6 pm. I put on my mask to be around them and they laugh about it several times. They show up with food and pies none of which I can eat or even like when I would be able to eat them and proceed to stay until 10 pm. Everytime I used the bathroom (in my apartment) to get sick my partners step father made comments about not being polite around guests (It's a 740 SQ ft apartment they sat at the kitchen bar that while there's a door and a wall is 7 ft away from the toilet). They finally go to leave and I tell my partner while he walks them down I'm going to straighten up and get in the shower he tells me it's rude to not walk them down after I have already not eaten what they brought and gotten sick around them all night no matter how valid my reason is. So I walk them down and in the process step and drag the ankle of my jeans in dog pee on my building lobby's floor. Several jokes about my pee pants ensue before they leave. My partner says he wants to check the mail so I leave to head up to the apartment. I straighten up and as he gets back I'm about ready to get into the shower where he starts to ask me what's up with me and my attitude.

I explain how my day of rest is completely stolen from me and that I'm exhausted and just really need to take off my dog pee jeans and shower and he says I thought you didn't care about your birthday and I don't understand etc and I continue trying to explain that I don't want to celebrate my birthday but if this is the one day a year in my life I'm supposed to have care concern attention and do what I want I still need that one day especially with everything going on and that's when he says ""I was going to put this effort in and decorate and get balloons and try to make you feel special but I was scared of you so I didn't"" and this made me just break down. I told him you realize how shitty it is to tell me that you didn't think I cared about my birthday so it should be fine it was about pleasing everyone but me but then you also follow it up with I was going to make you feel special but I didn't because you're scary. It's just not fair and it's made me feel worse when I already thought I was at my lowest. 

I cried a lot in the shower while he tried to console me and apologize but it didn't make it feel better and when I got out I became wired so I sat on my couch just looking at everything decorating for the holidays to do around the apartment and felt like I was drowning. He them tried to surprise me with my favorite pizza (which is big as he's a vegan and ordered me solely non vegan options that I could eat and have all to myself) but still I am only allowed so much sodium's every day so 1/4 of a slice and I was done unable to touch the sides or anything else and I ended up getting sick ten minutes later so I didn't even really get to keep it in. 

I'm just really stressed out and upset.


Edit to add- Part of my symptoms and side effects of my condition is that I'm just exhausted easily. Sick all the time not getting my usual sleep normal tasks are 5x and hard and in the apartment we have gone from a 50/50 split on all chores to my partner doing pretty much everything. Physically folding laundry is one of the hardest things for me right now and showering is just something I can't do alone now and I hate asking for the help I need. I figured if it was the one thing I was doing that day I would be able to do it alone which is a big peice of why I'm so upset. I am also the main driver in the relationship. It's my car he doesn't even own one and is only on my insurance because if we ever move out of the city it would be an awful rate to have him rejoin and so now with my condition I can't drive at all and the last month has felt like taking a taxi every time I get in my own car. I'm realizing now that maybe I'm a little compulsive and I have habits I hate letting go but how was I supposed to know my in-laws would be the complete opposite of who they normally are and my partner would for the first time ever be just ignorant. I have great relationships with all involved and plan on having the hard conversations as to why anything that happened happened it's just I have so little time and I'm so tired that I don't know when that will be. What I do know is in the meantime I'm going to focus on communicating with my partner and seeing what stopped up here and not texting and relying on his mom the way I normally do because clearly something is up and that doesn't mean I deserve what happened. 

I've also began talking to my partner obviously and as much as he apologizes and has worked to reclean the apartment I explained that it was my one day off that I lost and then to be called scary on top of it just really got to me because I'm in such a bad place. He did clarify that it's referencing in 2017 when he tried to make a big deal out of my birthday and that's the one time we have ever taken a break or had a big fight and I didn't talk to him for two weeks and he thought it was over he is always very jumpy and treads lightly around my birthday to the point where his mother was unaware that it was that date and my partner knows I want it to be treated like a normal day. Overall it was poor communication partly on me due to my tired state and assumption everyone would be normal, but also on everyone else who continually heard me say all I want is to shower and nap and ignored it because it's out of my character.

Edit: thanks for sharing your stories, everyone! I wish I could reply to them all, I had no idea there would be so many!

Tips that I read that will be useful if your find yourself in any of these situations:


RUN LIKE HELL
It’s okay to say “no” if you don’t feel comfortable when a stranger asks you for help. If you have a hard time saying no, try to think about whether you have the materials to help them fix whatever they need help with or if you know how to even fix it, for me, the answer is usually no if I think about it that way.
-if you’re walking alone, keep your phone in your hand and if you feel uneasy about someone  following you, keep 911 dialed just in case they try anything, they will hear the whole conversation. Make sure to yell out where you are, and a description of the man or woman. But most of all, run like hell
Do whatever you can to get out of the situation because if you’re behind closed doors, chances are, you won’t see daylight again. Scream, punch, kick, bite, elbow, anything just fight like hell to get out. 
In these situations, everything you know will “flipping fly out of your head”, do whatever it is that you know in the moment, whether it be freeze, fight, or flee but try to prepare yourself before It ever happens so that you know to fight or flee. If you freeze, scream to the top of your lungs.
Buy a strong pepper spray, they’re not allowed on airplanes  but you can get it at most cornerstores abroad if you ask around.
Don’t stand out, try to fly under the radar if you’re out of the country, don’t make it obvious you don’t speak their language.
ALWAYS trust your gut and be aware of your surroundings
Don’t walk around with headphones, if you do, leave one out and one in or put them in with no music on if you just don’t feel like being bothered.",AskWomen,1116,1573699262.0,591,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/dw2xqg/women_that_have_been_or_almost_been_kidnapped_sex/

[Original]http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/14vfku/reddit_women_unmarried_man37_will_be_having_his/

First I want to thank people for their advice on the original thread.  A lot of it was very helpful and it was a self confidence boost to know I was on the right track.  Thanks!

I've never been a particularly emotional guy.  Surely, I know the feeling of love  and I know the joy of a hug from my niece but 6 months ago if someone had told me I'd cry tears in happiness I would have thought them crazy.  As I waited near the baggage claim I had the worst case of butterflies in my entire life.  A first/second date didn't even compare with the turmoil I had going on and as I waited I was able to occupy my mind with every horrible scenario possible for Liz's visit.  Meeting Liz I was greeted with a full on tight hug which, right off the bat, started kicking my emotional butt but then she quickly followed that with a ""I'm so happy to finally get to  hug my Dad.""  It took every ounce of fake man cough I could muster to hold the tears at bay.  I start with this because it pretty much embodies her entire visit.  Between our initial meeting and her departure I had to use the fake cough, clearing of throat or sudden bathroom visit on more than a handful of occasions.  

We did a lot of fun things during her visit.  Went skiing, ice skating, saw a Broadway show.  Lots of firsts for her since she's only lived in a much warmer climate.  I'm glad I was warned about giving her personal time/space.  She wanted her alone time and I probably would have been either worried or annoyed had I not mentally prepared myself ahead of time.  We share a common interest in science and wanted to see where I worked so we spent a day doing that.  I know the parents out there will think ""Well no duhh"" but while visiting my work Liz showed a sincere understanding of a few concepts and I felt such an overwhelming feeling of pride.  I was completely taken off guard by it! 

""I love you"" was finally said the night before her flight home.  Throughout the visit I danced around it a bit to see her reaction but I refused to have her leave without hearing the words.  That evening, as we were scanning in photos I had saved from before I left, I told her about how on several occasions I almost threw these away but could never do it.  The box followed this unsentimental guy through years of grad school, medical school and several moves between different states after that.  More than once I placed it into the garbage only to go and dig it out later because I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to our story together.  I took the opportunity to explain to her how I have a 5 year relationship with her in my memory that she doesn't equally share and because of this I need to tell her that I loved her.  I loved her then and I love her now.   As we sat in silence the moments following and I considered how a better man than myself would not have walked away, regardless of what a stupid DNA test said, I noticed her holding back the tears this time.  

So where does it go from here?  We've decided we're going to see each other monthly even though it's a bit of flying to accomplish it.  She also wants to spend spring break and summer vacation with me and I'm quite excited about it.   After an 11 year gap I'm a Dad again and I love it.

Am I the only woman who doesn't experience much harassment or fear?,"I'm not in ANY way denying that sexual harassment, rape, misogyny, etc. are huge problems in our culture, nor am I suggesting that other women exaggerate their experiences or that they are somehow doing something to bring it on themselves. Please do NOT interpret this in that vein.

It's just... I really can't relate to the refrain of ""I as a woman feel unsafe walking at night/constantly receive unwanted sexual attention/have felt threatened when turning down men"" that #allwomenexceptme are talking about, and I wonder... Am I just really naive and not noticing when it happens? Am I invisible to men for some reason? Am I just too much of a hermit to encounter this? Are there ANY other women out there who feel as I do?

I'm not saying I've NEVER had any such experiences in my whole life...  but they have been so few and far-between that I think of them as isolated incidents, whereas other women talk about harassment/fear as a significant feature of their lived experience.

I went to college in the Boston area.",AskWomen,182,1401256898.0,346,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/26ob1p/am_i_the_only_woman_who_doesnt_experience_much/
"I'm a guy, and witnessed my first incidence of blatant street harassment the other day. I had no idea what to do. What should I have done?","So, the backstory:

I'm in Boston's South Station. A well-put-together dark-skinned woman walks by. A gelatinous, grotesque blob of a pasty white land-whale man-thing starts barking at her. What he says is reasonably tame, considering the stuff I've heard women recount as being said to them by men on the street, but it was still creepy and inappropriate - something to the effect of ""Hey. Hey you. You're beautiful. I love you. Really, you're beautiful. Come here, I wanna talk to you."" 

The woman in question kept walking, visibly affected yet never breaking stride, and calmly exited out the front doors into the rest of Boston like it was nothing out of the ordinary. 

Because the sad truth is: it probably wasn't. 

I realize there's all kinds of issues at work here - the difference in race among them (sexual availability of women of color being assumed as ""open"" and ""insatiable"" by default by white men). But the most salient point in my mind is my own reaction in the heat of the moment, which was to stand there like an idiot and do nothing. 

First of all, it was the first time I had actually seen such a thing happen. You hear about it all the time, but as a guy, you rarely actually *see* it happen so blatantly. Generally it's disguised (guy and a girl walking down the street, guy whispering in her ear, the girl giggling - typical teenage or twenty-something couple out and about? Or did the guy decide that the random girl walking by was hot and is whispering all the depraved things he wants to do to her, and she's just giggling awkwardly so as to not trigger a violent response? Who can tell from a removed perspective?) But in this case there were at least a half-dozen other men around, none of which did or said anything.

In hindsight, my intuition tells me I should have shouted the guy down, yelling at him to shut the hell up, nobody cares about his damned opinion, especially random women on the street that he apparently feels that he can harass at his leisure. 

In the moment, though, after I had come to terms with the fact that yes, this is really a thing that is happening (which was after the whole thing had ended, because the whole incident took *maybe* 10 seconds from start to finish), it felt like white-knighting. Like ""Fear not, fair maiden, for I, mooseinduced, will come to thy rescue and defend thine honor because it is a foregone conclusion that you are incapable of defending it yourself."" 

So what do you think? Was my intuition correct? Or should I have done something different? The ""Stand there like an idiot and do nothing"" thing seems like a terrible reaction, and I want to do better the next time I'm confronted with such a situation.

"Women of the world, how do I stop scaring women?","I figured this title would catch your attention.

A bit of background: I'm a pretty big guy, about two metres tall, kind of wide, big hair, etc. I live out in the suburbs and I have to travel with the bus, followed by a short walk through a fairly dark street. At least once a week, I end up walking on that path with a random woman who immediately starts showing signs of fear and/or discomfort (a lot of looks behind her shoulder, quickened pace, pulling out her cell phone without actually using it, etc.). In a few cases, the women have turned out to be my neighbours which freaks them out when I follow them into the neighbourhood. I don't necessarily blame them, because, like I said, I may be seen as an imposing figure, but, if you ask any woman who knows me well enough, they will tell you (even though this term has been co-opted by assholes) that I am a nice guy who would never harm anyone (I am also a feminist, if that helps). It would be difficult to convince them of that though. I sometimes try to overtake them, but that tended to heighten things; in one case, some random woman actually turned around to confront me! Is there anything that I can do to avoid this, other than staying home? I mean, I do have feelings too and if I get looked at like I'm a monster one more time, I swear I will run into traffic!

How can I stop my female friends from cock-blocking me? ,"It's getting out of hand. (M25)

Most recently: New Year's Eve. 

My friends and I went to a fancy New Year's Eve charity event downtown, and I went 'stag'. I didn't want to be alone at midnight, so I went to the bar and started talking to people. I met a very interesting girl, who also didn't have anyone to kiss at midnight. We absolutely 'clicked', it was amazing. It was one of those conversations that make guys remember why we don't just buy a fleshlight and register a Brazzers account. You know those types of conversations? They're great. 

[Not this](http://qkme.me/3sg3m5)

Needless to say, while I had only known this girl for ~20 minutes, I was excited I had met someone fun but was scared to invite her to the table my group was at.  After a few more minutes, one of her girlfriends came over and stole her to go to the bathroom to do whatever the hell it is that you do in there. I assume it is anything but pee. I gave her a hug and told her if she didn't meet me at my table in 10 minutes I would send out a search party. Add a few seconds of good eye contact, and she was pulled away. 

At this point, I'm standing there in a suit, watching her walk away, and pretty much feeling like that Marlon Brando gif I've seen on r/ladyboners 1,000 times. 

I leave the bar and maneuver through the heathens to the other side of the venue, where my group had reserved a table. There was a mix of girls in relationships, and single girls, all of whom I know well and age from 22-25. I love them to death, but they're very 'protective'. So when my new friend returns from the bathroom, my friends go from being absolute sweethearts to some sort of mother bear clan who is protecting their cub from a nuclear charged alligator. My new friend comes up to me and put her arm around me, I return the favor and give her a quick side hug. In the two seconds the hug took place, body language changed. 

My friends now enter momma bear mode, and became much more flirty with me. All of this was to intimidate the new girl. They would come up and pull my tie, fix my collar, put their phone in my pocket, etc.,  basically raising the level of physical contact. This, of course, made my new friend feel uncomfortable, and this was not the first time. They have scared other girls off before, and justified it by saying it's because they didn't like them and thought they were wrong for me. Out of the women I introduce to them, some are too bitchy, some are too fake, too tall, too short, too tan, too red-headed, etc. 

I find it endearing, and appreciate that they care about me that much, but holy shit, I'm 25, I'm not looking for a wife tomorrow. I've told them this, and they said they will stop when I find a nice girl that they can trust around me. So far that has been 1 person in the last 4 years, and of course she moved to Kansas. I value their input on girls that I'm considering dating, but if it's some girl I met at a bar and neither of us have dating intentions, I don't see why my friends need to be so judgmental. As my friends, shouldn't they be guiding my cock? Not blocking it? 

I have talked to them about it, and this post is basically a transcript of what I told them. But they continue to shamelessly do it. 

Apart from the obvious 'don't bring one-night-stands around you friends', how can I communicate with them that they need to stop intentionally preventing me from being around other women? 


TL;DR - My female friends intentionally scare away all of my potential hookups. How do I keep them from cock blocking me?

I'm conscious that when I'm on the street late at night my presence can make some women feel uncomfortable (sad but true fact).

&amp;#x200B;

Some topics to consider:

\- men acting less aggressive and/or more actively seeking consent when moving in for the kiss, taking clothes off, etc.

\- men engaging in less (or maybe more) catcalls and street harassment

\- men avoiding women at work in professional and/or social contexts (i.e. following the Mike Pence rule, not going out with female co-workers to happy hour, etc.)

\- men being less likely to make a move on female co-workers/subordinates

\- more generally, men being less likely to flirt with women in non-workplace situations. Some guys on Reddit claim they're avoiding women now, but I have a feeling that's just typical Reddit whining rather than a broader trend among men in general. But who knows.

"That awkward path crossing at night; do large men make you feel threatened or otherwise uncomfortable, and is there anything we can do about it?","Last night, I was walking home from class around 9:45pm. I walk down a long sidewalk with a portion covered by low hanging trees that block out the street light. A petite woman exits her car and walks towards me. I feel the night masks my complete lack of interest in her and that she might feel threatened by my presence. My attempt at a friendly greeting comes out as a gravely and gruff ""hi,"" that sounds scary to me. She says ""hi"" back in a more upbeat voice and the encounter ends as I walk away.

My question is, what can I do to make strangers know I'm just trying to get home and feel more comfortable? Should I hold myself a certain way, keep hands out of pockets, say or not say anything? BTW I'm white, 6'1"", and 220lb (185cm 99kg). 

Edit: Some women are cool with a brisk hello, and others want you to ignore them as much as possible. Always keep your distance, avoid making eye contact, don't sneak up on them, don't give the appearance of chasing them if you're behind them (some like you to say, ""excuse me, I'm going to pass you""), don't attempt a conversation, and if you have a call to make, now is a good time.",AskWomen,73,1373642582.0,129,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1i5o86/that_awkward_path_crossing_at_night_do_large_men/
Ever met a guy that was TOO perfect? ,"I met this guy, totally out of my league, hot, fit, kind, funny. So naturally I fucked him. Turns out he doesn't only have a nice big BEAUTIFUL dick but he also is a deviant god. So fucking dominant. He knows how to do bondage properly and beautifully, he takes his time fucking me... I mean dude, you have no idea how hard it is to find that combo. And he finds me attractive. Like awesome right? Well...I dunno. I Mean HES JUST SOOOOO HOLLYWOOD. That's the best way I can describe it. Here, I'll tell you about a bunch of things he does that really shouldn't happen in real life:


**(1)** Usually before or after we fuck he looks at me up and down while I'm naked, stares at me deeply and says ""You're beautiful you know that?"" or ""You're so fucking beautiful"". Now... I get I should be stoked. Like ""Dude he's complimenting you"" right? But.. I'm an overweight out of shape south american woman. That shit ain't pretty, sister. **I know I'm more than fuckable** but the way he says it just sounds sooo...sooo.. ugh.. I dunno. Do you understand what I'm saying? Like if you had acne and someone came up to you and said you have an awesome skin...

**(2)** Walking alone at night. I think I had said something about liking to eat and I might have described what I think is a perfect burger. so he stops me, tilts my head up by touching my chin and kisses me passionetely. Again ""Dude...that sounds like AWESOME"" ....well then why am I feeling so...WEIRD? It's just ODD! Right? Am I the only one?


**(3)** He picks me up. The first time I told him: ""Yo! You'll probably get a hernia if you pick me up. And all that extra space between me and the floor if you hold me up here is just confusing to me, I'm constantly panicking that you're going to break your back and that I'll be charged with manslaughter.""  He laughed and very dominantly told me to ""Shut the fuck up"" and refused to put me down and started kissing me. So again you'd think ""Dude! why are you complaining he's awesome"" and maybe if there was a film crewe filming us it would be but there wasn't and I. Did not. Like it. I DUNNO WHY! WHYY????? Why don't I feel comfortable about this?

**(4)** He kisses my forehead. Says stuff like ""You know, I like you. And not just because of the sex. I REALLY like you"" with that smolder look he has most of the time. Something Like [this](http://imgur.com/B0P0O) a bit more serious. He likes to cuddle, He has awesome stamina, he smells good, He trims his pubes, his balls smell nice and clean all the time, his feet don't smell, He even owns a bike with all the attire, he is great with children and loves them too, he doesn't mind period sex, we have nothing yet so much in common, we have the same sense of humour.

I even farted infront of him and he didn't even flinch he looked at me smiled and said ""Good one"". I Laughed my embarrassment away and then he let one rip aswell followed by a ""I win"". Not only is that total badass but I love that he actually tried to make it the least embarrasing for me too. He's just such a gentleman. 

WHY DO I FIND IT SO OFFPUTTING THEN???????????? I told all my friends this and they think I'm overreacting...but it's driving me mad that I can't find ONE thing wrong with him. We've been dating for 6 weeks now and I somehow don't like him! I DUNNNO! I DUNNO WHY!! WHY?? I mean. 

***WHY CANT I LIKE HIM?????***

"Ladies, what's your go-to self-defense tactics or tips?","Last night as I was waiting for my bf in my car outside of his house, a random car kept slowly passing me by driving up and down the street. They were swerving and slowed down especially while passing next to my side of the window. This happened a few times until they parked in front of me. I couldn't look up (because I was a big chicken) but they had a perfect view of me with their headlights shining directly on my face. Of course once my bf came walking out the car casually drove away. Regardless, nothing felt right about that. 

Although nothing happened, and I may be thinking too far into this, I still felt like a helpless sitting duck. I'm 5'2"", small and thin. It doesn't help that my leg is currently injured, and that I'm fairly attractive and a very anxious person. I'm not too sure how to handle situations like this (or far worse) in the future if I'm in dire need to protect myself or someone else. I can't imagine what it's like to actually be confronted or assaulted by someone while being completely alone.

UPDATE: How should a transgender man approach a woman without freaking her out or scaring her off?,"Alright, so my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/wdzha/how_should_a_transgender_man_approach_a_woman/) was made over 9 months ago. A lot has happened since then, some good stuff and some not so good stuff, but in the end mostly good stuff...

A summary of my last post: I was born with a female body but I am a man, which makes me a transgender man (FTM); though to be accurate and honest, I mostly reject my trans-ness and identify as a man. Plain and simple. After a pretty shitty relationship and break up I decided to start dating again but didn’t know how to approach the issue of being transgender. I am very comfortable with my body and have a strong preference for straight, very feminine women. This preference had not worked out well for me so far and lead me to get turned down a lot. My question to /r/AskWomen was how I could approach women and inform them of my “situation” without putting them off or scaring them off.

Alright, so how have the last 9 months gone?

Well, not too long after I made that post I kind of got into a friends with benefits situation with an ex-girlfriend of mine from college. We provided each other with a lot of emotional support and had sex whenever I was in town (it was long distance, but she is going to school in my hometown so I visited frequently). It was mostly a crutch and it wasn’t a very satisfying sexual relationship. I fapped a lot, per usual.

While I was doing that whole FWB thing, up until the new year, I was keeping my eye open to possibilities. I started getting out of my shell a lot more, which was a challenge in and of itself, being in a new city and all. I would go out with my friends to break dancing clubs, burlesque shows, out to see local DJs and bands play, and just out to the bars. Basically, if there was something I wanted to do or see or experience,  I wouldn’t hesitate to do/see/experience it. I treated approaching women the same way. If there was a woman that caught my eye I would approach her, buy her a drink, be suave and shit and I usually had a good conversation but didn’t feel enough of a connection to pursue it further. This might be because I wasn’t ready or because I my FWB crutch or because the girls just really weren’t all that great, who knows, but regardless nothing came of those adventures.

Well, I wouldn’t say that nothing came of it. I got really good at just talking to women and ordering drinks and becoming friends with everyone, especially bartenders. Not to mention, I got to hang out with some of my friends and do cool shit, and doing cool shit is fun.

**Relationship # 1**

But one of my friends really wanted to set me up with her best friend. I was pretty skeptical about this from the beginning. Basically, I had hung out with this girl a few times at the bar or at a party and small talk was fine but she didn’t seem that, well, deep. Another thing, she mostly dates women. But, after my original post, I was more open to the idea of dating bisexual women.

So, because this woman was a friend of a friend, she was already privy to the plumbing in my pants, if you follow me. No mystery, there. New Years Eve rolls around and we basically double date with our mutual friend. I kiss her at midnight, get her number, pay her tab, get wasted, dry out, and drive home. We make plans to go on a few dates and do. I do my lady-killer moves and she’s just... blah. Eventually we have sex and the first time it was good, and after that it was awful. The worst kind of dead fish situation. I’m not sure if she was intimidated or nervous, but she was never open to communication so it just sucked. 

I should have listened to my gut to begin with. I honestly don’t think she’s into guys and I think she has a misconception about what it would be like dating a transman. I am not at all some kind of androgynous, embrace-my-femininity kind of guy; I have all of the best and worst parts of being a man and I really don’t think she was into any of that. But hey, we all have preferences and I wasn’t hers and she wasn’t mine. By the time I realized that I was done it was less than a week before Valentines Day, so I decided to wait until after to break it off. Big mistake. She got weird and clingy and distant all at the same time and it was a bad two weeks. It’s over though, so, *whew.*

When I realized that I was consistently dating this woman from NYE I had told my FWB that I was seeing someone and didn’t want either of them to get the wrong idea about the situation, meaning that I ended the FWB thing. But then, once things ended with the NYE woman I started talking to my FWB again.

**Relationship # 2**

This whole time I had an account on OKCupid, with nothing in my profile to suggest that I’m a transman. I opened the account when I was still in college, trying to meet people to hang out with once I moved, but no one ever messaged me (which was frustrating) and no one ever messaged me back (which is even more frustrating). I was only checking it about once a week for shits and giggles and getting back into the concerts, bars, and burlesque show routine, but then I got this message from this woman with awesome dimples and a beautiful smile. She actually messaged me about Reddit, of all things, and I later found out that she had searched specifically for redditors (so thank you, reddit, for doing me a solid there). 

Within two days out brief messages became pages long and we set up a date. Wasting no time! Based on our profiles and messages, it was inevitable that we would click right away, and of course we did. I took her out to a nice dinner, wine and dined her, did all my lady-killer moves and everything. Even though I was hella nervous (and so was she) we both had a great time. I kind of got ahead of myself and went for the kill. I asked her if I could kiss her, she said yes, and I did. I hadn’t disclosed yet that I was trans. I got back into my car and was basically yelling at myself. I had given myself that one rule: no physical intimacy before disclosure, based on my original post, and I broke it. This was the only time I broke that rule, and damned if I was going to let that one mistake ruin the first true connection I’ve ever felt with a woman. (And this would be where I broke it off with my FWB for the second time, though she didn't get the hint and I had to spell it out for her a week later.)

I knew I needed to tell her but I was pretty nervous about the whole thing. I ended up looking at her OKCupid profile again just to check if she had answered the ""Would you date a transgender person?"" question. Yeah, that question exists, and yeah, she did answer it. She had said ""no"". Well, damn. But I couldn't ignore the connection we had, and an answer on an online dating profile isn't a real answer or rejection, so I decided to just tell her and see where it went anyway.

So, we talk again the next day, and everything is great. Then I got super distant for a while (like half of a day). I needed to tell her, since we were *thiiiis close* to planning our second date. I actually have the text messages from when I told her:

&gt; **Ronald:** Damn you beat me to it! I was going to ask you but I was cleaning my shower (it was awful). But yes. We should. Before we go ahead making plans I just wanted to tell you something. It's not a big deal to me but I want to be open and honest with you. I'm a trans guy.

&gt; **Girl:** That's legit. I appreciate you telling me. That's awesome that you're so chill about it.
It's not something I would go actively searching for, but its not a deal breaker either. I'm probably technically bisexual, though I've never acted on it. 

&gt; **Ronald:** Welp. That's fantastic. So, where to tomorrow?
(feel free to ask me anything, btw. I'm pretty open about it once I break the stealth seal)

&gt; **Girl:** Where to? I'm up for whatever. I had Thai tonight though, so I would prefer not that! :P
How long have you been on hormones? I'm assuming you must be? I don't know much about this whole thing. What kind of things do people normally ask? :)

And that’s basically how it went. I walked her through the bigger topics, she asked questions, I gave answers, and mostly we planned our second date. We saw a comedy show and had pizza. It was nice. She also slept over that night because we just didn’t want to be done with the date, though clothes stayed on.

Sex happend on date number three, which was a mellow night at my apartment. That was also the night that I asked her to be my girlfriend. Basically, all of my trans stuff was a non-issue for her. I think this has a lot to do with my honesty and openness, and pretty much where I am in my life and transition. I think that if I was insecure with myself then she would have reacted differently. I think our success together has a lot to do with our mutual timing; she was finally in a good place with her stuff, I was finally in a good place with my stuff, and it just worked. When she mentioned being “bisexual” she was more-so referencing being attracted to masculine people, regardless of genitalia. She has never date women or been in a relationship with a woman. She’s only ever treated me as a man and I have never felt more comfortable in my role in a relationship.

We’re still dating. It’s been two months, two of the most amazing months. Not only is all of the emotional and gooey shit fantastic, but the sex is amazing. We recently incorporated a prosthetic for me (read: strap on), and it’s given a whole new and exciting dynamic to sexy time.

So, yeah. That’s been my exploits for the last 9 months. I’m up for answering questions (in comments or PMs) so feel free! 

**TL;DR** Fuck you. I just spent a long time writing that, go read it!

EDIT 1: I just want to thank everyone for the positive response to this post. I know a lot of other trans guys also appreciate the fact that so many people understand why it's importnat to recognize the good stuff and to talk about it. My girlfriend ([TheDukesMistress](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1dtjok/update_how_should_a_transgender_man_approach_a/c9tt0e1)) also really enjoyed chiming in and adding her perspective.

It also linked to this artcle about people telling women to smile. http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/12/2614421/stop-telling-women-smile/
I am trying to educate myself here, as I cannot fathom someone demanding a smile, let alone harassing them about it. A suggestion, maybe, but I do not believe I have personally even done that. I have however had both men and women suggest I smile, as I am pretty much cronically stoic. I never felt like they were being demanding. 

So in short, I am just trying to get some women's experiences and perspectives on this.

How scary is it being alone as a woman?,I don't mean loneliness but rather being by yourself with no one around. I hear it time and time again that women are cautious about going out alone for fear of harassment or worse. Is it really that bad or is it somewhat overblown?

"Ladies, how would you react if the cute guy you pass on the street, then make eye contact and smile at, actually stopped and said something or justed asked for your number?","So this is purely hypothetical, and is something that I've recently been wondering. I moved to San Francisco 6 months ago and the amount of beautiful girls here is staggering. I just turned twenty one a few days ago so I'm getting into the bar scene, etc. 

I've met a lot of girls in the parks, including a girl I dated for 3 months,    But we always hang out, drink and smoke for a few hours. I recently cut my hair, and as happened last time I did this, I've consciously been noticing more girls looking at me, smiling, etc. I'm no model, but I like the way I look, and I catch a lot of girls passing me on the street. I feel like it would be creepy or strange to actually just stop and say ""hey, you're cute, and we haven't spoken yet, but we should at some point."" 

As far as I know, no one has ever successfully done this, but then again, no one I know has ever tried.

**EDIT: You wise women know your stuff. So yesterday I made a few of the little note cards, with my name, number, and with a different little phrase of how they had caught my eye on each.

 Girl #1 was in the Castro Street station, a really cute Asian girl who was trading subtle smiles with me as we waited for our respective trains, since she was across the tracks. Even if I crumpled it up it wouldn't make it over the tracks, though this did little to deter me. I took out a pen from my bag, unrolled it, put the note inside, and waited for one of our trains to come. Mine did first, so just as it neared the tunnel I smiled openly at her and threw the pen underhand over the tracks at her. I smiled at her till the train blocked my view, and when I got out of the tunnel a few stops later, there was a new text. #1 said I made her smile, and invited me to a place she interns at tomorrow for free beer and tacos. Excellent things, indeed. 

Girl #2 was my moment of truth. A beautiful dark brunette who I walked past on Valencia street. She was on the other side of the crosswalk and we both waited for the signal. I decided to just say fuck it and take another note out of my pocket, and smiled at her as I passed her and gave it to her, saying I liked her shoes, which I truthfully did, being Gladiatorial and such. About an hour later, she texted me saying that that had never happened to her and it was kinda weird, though flattering, but she was single and was down to meet a bar this weekend. Reddit, how did I not know this before?

Girl #3, who will be spoken of again soon, was on the bus, an adorable strawberry blonde who I was way more confident about smiling at and meeting her eye after the earlier success. But she didn't shy from it, and giggled a few times, and whispered to her friend. When I got off, I handed her a note and told her that it was 'for her eyes only'. Kinda lame, yes, but she called me not a minute later, asking what I was doing that night, and invited me to a birthday party for her friend. I told her probably yeah, if she texted me the address. She said she would, and sure enough, at nine that night, I got an address over in the Haight, and headed over. I woke up at #3's place in the sunset, let's just say I couldn't wait to see her again. Which was later today for a smoke and a walk round the taco trucks.

Girl #4 was a blonde girl I passed on Market street and just decided to give her my last note as I passed. Strange look, and no texts. I got a laugh at her face though, so i still win.   ",AskWomen,40,1348540630.0,84,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10ffz5/ladies_how_would_you_react_if_the_cute_guy_you/
How do you deal with unwanted attention?,"I'm 17 and have recently started a job as a till assistant at a popular fast food chain. I also usually finish shifts at around 10 on Friday and Saturday nights and while it's a very short walk to where I get a lift home, I have to walk past several pubs and nightclubs. I've recently had some interactions with people that have made me incredibly uncomfortable, such as a man following me then asking me a load of personal questions and failing to leave me alone when it was clear I didn't want to interact with him.

I'm also 5""2 and about 100lbs and can often be socially awkward as well as looking a few years older. I could probably convince quite a few people I'm around 19.

SUMMARY ABOUT THE BOOKS CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE WHO CARES

**The Handmaid's Tale** - Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now..

**A Brave New World** - Far in the future, the World Controllers have created the ideal society. Through clever use of genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational sex and drugs, all its members are happy consumers. Bernard Marx seems alone harbouring an ill-defined longing to break free. A visit to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old, imperfect life still continues, may be the cure for his 
distress...

**Oryx &amp; Crake** - Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by a plague, is struggling to survive in a world where he may be the last human, and mourning the loss of his best friend, Crake, and the beautiful and elusive Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey–with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake–through the lush wilderness that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride.

**The Road** - A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other

**Never Let Me Go** - In one of the most acclaimed and strange novels of recent years, Kazuo Ishiguro imagines the lives of a group of students growing up in a darkly skewered version of contemporary England. Narrated by Kathy, now 31, Never Let Me Go hauntingly dramatises her attempts to come to terms with her childhood at the seemingly idyllic Hailsham School, and with the fate that has always awaited her and her closest friends in the wider world. A story of love, friendship and memory, Never Let Me Go is charged throughout with a sense of the fragility of life.

**Galápagos** - Galápagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Galápagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race. In this inimitable novel, America’s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry–and all that is worth saving

**Wool** - n a ruined and hostile landscape, in a future few have been unlucky enough to survive, a community exists in a giant underground silo. Inside, men and women live an enclosed life full of rules and regulations, of secrets and lies.To live, you must follow the rules. But some don't. These are the dangerous ones; these are the people who dare to hope and dream, and who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple and deadly. They are allowed outside. Jules is one of these people. She may well be the last.

**Earth Abides** - Before the first page the human race has been almost completely wiped out by plague. Our hero Isherwood ""Ish"" Williams discovers a female survivor and fumblingly tries to bring up a new civilization in the ruins of California. It's an elegiac story of loss as humanity makes it through the crisis, at the cost of our race's painfully gathered knowledge--which seems irrelevant to the new generations as they develop a hunter-gatherer society reminiscent of the old Amerindian tribes, and see no practicality in the fabulous tales of the old days told them by Ish

I hate that I feel the need to dress differently just so guys ignore me but if I'm ever in a dress I get honked at and yelled at from cars and I'm just so scared every time I leave the house. 

Mace and pepper spray are illegal here in Australia, so I carry spray deodorant, a lighter (flame thrower) and a pen around just in case. I know I'm paranoid, I'm just very distrusting of people.

"Ladies, how do you feel about a man approaching you while you're walking alone?","A little context here. Recently I was walking to work in the middle of the afternoon when an older man (Older as in late 30's or 40's... I'm in my early 20's) honked at me, rounded the block, and tried to block me off at a residential street. He began trying to get me to come over and when I pulled out my pepper spray and began to walk faster, He told me to put a smile on my face. At this point I turned around and threatened him with my keys yelling that I would call the police. He sat there for a minute and slowly turned and drove past me. After the adrenaline wore off I began to wonder if that wasn't an over-reaction.

Until less than 24 hours later, I decided to take a walk down the neighborhood bike path with my camera just for fun. While I was photographing things, a somewhat unkempt looking man in his late 40's approached me from off the path(very quickly may I add) and started repeatedly asking ""What do you see?"" Needless to say he startled the living hell out of me, and I stammered while trying to tell him to stay away. He kept coming towards me and honestly I was in such a ""fight or flight"" mode I don't remember what I did that made him back off. Either way I was terrified.

In my experience it's an unwritten law that you just DON'T approach a woman walking alone, especially if she's half your age, and ESPECIALLY if she doesn't see you coming. I was also always taught that an overreaction is better than an underreaction in these situations so that anyone nearby is alerted to what may happen.

I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid about this sort of thing or if this is the right way to go. How do you handle these situations?

EDIT: I appreciate every one of your responses! Thank you! I feel like I learned a few new things and I hope others did too!",AskWomen,27,1380249608.0,59,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1n80mb/ladies_how_do_you_feel_about_a_man_approaching/
Are women romantically and sexually attracted to men? Essay long serious question from inexperienced nerd guy.,"Edit. I put in a TL;DR at the bottom now.

If you think the title is a joke then no I am just clueless. Quick backstory so you know why I have to post this.

I have been a shut in nerd for over 20 years. The live in mom's basement type. But it is really my room on the upstairs, not a basement, and it is not a basement for my buddies either. Take it from the source.

Next I have never dated much less talked to a non-family member girl for very long. Yes in my whole life. All home schooling, in childhood I was kept away from children because they could have got me into smoking or drinking and crap like that, and I live on online games right now as much as I did the past 10 years.

Next all the women in my family have divorced or otherwise unhappy marriages where they claim to not love or be attracted to him and stay with him for the kids.

Last is the big one. When I say all the women I mean my mother too. We have talked about it in detail and yes I am alive and my siblings are alive not because of sexual, physical, romantic, emotional attraction at all. Wtf? Is this common? Do not think bad of her please. She said she just wanted a family and I am totally sure she isnt a lesbian or bi at all because I asked. And apparently not straight?

Now that you see where I am coming from, hear my plight. From my own learning about the world, women do not seem attracted to men, for the same reasons men such as me are attracted to women. I fantasize about passionate romantic love and someone to come home to and want to spend time and her life with me as much as I do her. I am not strongly sexual. But I know I am not asexual, gay, bi, pan. Sex would do NOTHING for me if it was a one way street. Me being interested hinges on her feeling the same way about me.

Recently I joined okcupid too, a month ago. I did not send any messages yet, please understand baby steps and it took a lot to join. It seems women do not message men on there. And it seems most men just message with sup and are seeking casual sex. These are accurate suspicions you think? Anyways I will definately not meet women IRL. I don't drink and do drugs or go to bars. I don't like the idea honestly of joining a hobby club of a thing like dancing or yoga or things just to meet women as the primary goal. I am not like most men who just want to pick up ""chicks"" and use them.

It probably is good to mention most of the women I would message on okcupid are listed as bi. I do not know what to make of that, because why would they pick me over a cute girl. Are all women bi a little bit even if they say straight? Sorry to ask that but I am that clueless. I am not Brad Pitt, I am just a guy. Brad Pitt posting this would be real funny though. But yes I am not fat with a disgusting neck beard, I take care of my body, and don't wear fedoras and that crap. But why would I assume that a girl could be physically attracted to me when I have never been told otherwise, and never learned otherwise.

If you read this far and wonder how to help or what to say at all, let me try to make questions.

1, what do you think of all this. Am I crazy? Or does it make sense for me to feel this unsure. Just because I am attracted to women does not mean I can infer they could be attracted to me.

2, are you romantically attracted to men? Like passionate true love and that crap in the movies. A spark and true feelings as deep for him as he can have for you, instead of ONLY being with a man for life companionship the way you would see a coworker or someone in your military platoon where it is just a job. A team mate in a game if you will, the game of life. A team mate you do not love but you are good at working with even if there are no deep romantic love feelings.

3, are you sexually attracted to men? Physical sexual interest the way I think a girl is cute and I would do anything sexual she asked me, even if it is better if we are in love. And yes then also emotional sexual attraction like sharing the act with your soul mate or ""the one"" if that means anything other than Keanu Reeves. I know I am sexually drawn to women, but less now than younger, but let me tell you puberty was hard sh!t to go through alone in your room. I talked to a couple girls on yahoo messenger teen chats for a few minutes and most or all had boyfriends or girlfriends. I made it a goal to lose virginity before age 14 thinking sex was a big damn deal. Here I am in my middle 20's and much sadder about lonelyness and no love than no sex. :(

4, are you attracted to men in other ways than those 2 ways? Things like life companion, being supported with a house and money, raising children with a man that is fit enough to be not a train wreck father, being protected from other people and things. Though the last one is some ancient instinct from the cavemen era mostly isn't it.

5, I do not think it's bad to be attracted in non love and sex ways from all possibilities in question 4. But, am I correct in guessing some women do not have love or sex attraction and only are attracted for question 4 reasons like child and family raising, or money, or boredom or who the hell knows. If yes is there any way to avoid becoming involved with women like that. I am deathly afraid of being used by someone I would fall in love with and they lack any love or attraction for me. Scared enough that if I dont make baby steps like this post and okcupid account, I can be a movie subject like the 40 year old virgin.

6, if you read this far then thank you for dealing with my confusion. Is there any other way or things you can explain that would help with my fears besides these questions? They are just some big questions I don't know any answer to, at least answers I believe deep down, but I am all ears with learning anything you girls can tell me or link me. I will read all comments and any linked material to anything.

Please if you reply just read this part, I do not need to be told I am hopeless, and a moron, and that of course I a heterosexual man cannot see why anyone would want to be with a man, or that individual women answering cannot help me and that I should instead seek professional help from a therapist and those guys. They would waste my time I feel, and I don't want to talk to guys who are paid to give me an answer like ""women are attracted to men obviously because of biology unless they are lesbian"", and what would they tell me that women in here actually interested in helping with this post and my issues could not do. Everything there is to know in life, everyone has to learn somewhere and in their own way remember.

Man I hope this isn't deleted because I spent 3 hours on it and honest to God not asking for dating and relationship advice, or medical help. And I don't think I broke other rules like I am not a misogynist. I am very intrigued by and just confused by women and obviously or so I hope it's obvious, very very inexperienced, and curious. Maybe I seem very creepy, or sexist or some crap. But trust me I would never hurt a girl physically or emotionally. I am the annoying inexperienced chivalrous white knight behind the computer screen with all his online RPG buddies and no girls in our guild. No I didn't scare them off. At least I don't think I did because I don't talk to girls even in games lol. :(

I love anonymity so I can if people reply potentially learn things in a non embarrassing way since I can use a throw away account. Damn long post though sorry for telling my life story but I figured it would shed light on why I am earnestly asking the questions that I am.

TL;DR. Women in my family including mother say no sex or love, just other reasons to marry. I was home schooled and only play online games with other guys for the extent of my social life. I have built up many fears and because of my life so far I have not convinced myself a girl can love me the way I feel I would love her in romantic and emotional way, and that she could be sexually and physically attracted to me the way I am to her. I am scared of being used in any way like a throw away husband for providing anything from money to children. I do not want anything close to prostitution ever and I am morally against that ""profession."" I am also confused if all women are bi even if they say straight and if so why would they pick me over a girl. I feel that advice from real women and answers to these life long questions will help more than referring me to ""professional help"" which sorry but in this case I feel would be a waste of my time and money to talk to someone about.",AskWomen,0,1406036108.0,57,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2be5l8/are_women_romantically_and_sexually_attracted_to/

When running at night how should I alert women to my presence while approaching from behind?,"I am a man and I often run in my neighborhood around 4 or 5 am.  I live in an old neighborhood with almost no street lights so it is genuinely dark winter or summer.  While running or cooling down, I occasionally see women who are walking their dog, getting the paper or who are also walking/running.  Sometimes these women are even in their bathrobes.  

Many times I am running up behind them and I wrestle with how best to announce myself.  I always cross to the other side of the street first, but I still need to let them know I'm coming.  I worry that if I scuff my feet from far away they will think I am running at them (because it's so dark).  Meanwhile if I scuff my feet near them they may be startled that a man has suddenly appeared.

So far I wait until I am about 25 ft behind them on the other side of the street, scuff my feet and then say ""Good Morning!"" in as cheerful and nonthreatening voice as I can (think Ned Flanders) when they turn.  This seems to work sometimes, but other times they gasp and clutch their chests.  Perhaps serial killers sound like Ned Flanders too. 

What should I do instead?

Edit:  Thanks for the suggestions and comments.  I'll try the ""on your left"" thing since it immediately says ""I'm running/biking for exercise"" and may orient the person more quickly.  I should probably also wear some sort of safety vest, belt or miner's light (I saw a woman running this morning with one!), but it hasn't been an issue at that time of day.

"Women of reddit, do you think it's right to be taught / told to not confront people who harass you on the street? Why or why not?","I was talking to my co-workers (2 females) about catcalling today and how surprised I was that people are telling women that they should not confront a person who is harassing them on the street. I, for one, absolutely believe that all women have the freedom to respond to catcalling in whatever way they would like, whether responding positively, simply ignoring it and walking away, or giving them their piece of mind. Would I prefer more women to tell the harassers that they do not appreciate it? Absolutely. 

My co-workers did not agree with me at all. They said that it is crazy to confront someone who is in the state of mind to be harassing women on the street, whether it is ""Hey babymama"" or more profrane things. Their reasoning was the following: 1) the person is crazy and could turn violent 2) what if the confrontation sets them off and it ends with rape, death, or assault 3) what if they are set off and in anger rape, kill or assault another person and 4) they will completely disregard everything that is said, so the purpose is lost. 

I wouldn't mind if the above was just their personal opinion, but they believed that no women should ever be confrontational in this situation and urged me to do the same. I've had a couple of other people say the same thing as well, whether through a forum, thread, or in person. 

I am very curious as to what you have to say. ~~Does the possibility of violent behavior pose such a threat?~~ Does the possibility of violent behavior pose such a threat that all women should stay their silence in every situation of street harassment? Do you also teach girls and women that they should stay silent in these circumstances?

Unlike most people, when I'm walking about in public going somewhere I don't have my face buried in my phone and like to people watch men and women to pass the time. I've noticed a couple odd behaviors from women. Say when I am coming to within 30 feet of a woman walking the other way, if I even move my pupils to the side of my vision where she is, I'll often see her instantly take out or raise her phone to her face or ear and pretend she just got a text or call. Or a woman walking in front of me might briefly prop open a door for me and afterwards I'll be walking behind her because we're heading to the same place in the gym/shopping area. After about 20 feet of this, sometimes I'll see her take an abrupt turn left or right and stop so that I pass. Often, they'll end up facing a blank wall for some time when they do this and looking back it's quite comical as they seem glued to a wall for no reason...

Certainly, these aren't the only tactics and this doesn't happen all the time; sometimes they make eye contact and smile or look down and smile,etc. I am below average height for my race, so, certainly, I realize a good % of women will immediately find me repulsive w/o needing to see my face or how I dress and that that is the trigger for these avoidance behaviors. That's fine - what I really want to know about this is how much introspective access women have in this area.

Those of you that are consciously aware that you employ these tactics, are you actively thinking of everything that triggers it? Do you remember when you started using these tactics and it is something you feel you absolutely need to do to avoid problems or is it more that doing it makes you feel desired and wanted - i.e. I have to fend off all these men in otherwise safe public areas that maybe might hit on me? Or do you partition out sections of time as 'I want to meet men' or 'absolutely don't want; very bad if I have to maybe deal with one' and toggle the avoidance tactics accoringly?

__________________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: So, what I've gathered is that women or at least the women of AskWomen really, really hate strangers in public and want no interaction with them whatsoever, especially if they're male. OK. 

I've also read the 'creepy' FAQ on here and thinking back to my home country men do approach strange women in public far more often and overwhelmingly in the not 'creepy' way. I just don't remember the guys often being nervous, stammering, and talking too fast or the girls looking frightened, shocked, and apprehensive. However, unlike the explanation given by one of the posters below it's also the case that the girls are FAR more assertive. They'll hint and then definitely WILL abruptly walk away or WILL scathingly tell you off if you're starting to annoy them.

Another input is that in my home country it is just that people are much less often in huge rushes in public. Part of this is dilution by all the women and men that just go on strolls more often and often alone in the parks, the shopping areas, and even boring streets too. They sit around in the cafes drinking a coffee alone more often than here and with no particular task. Unlike another poster's reply below, also the bars and clubs aren't considered the only 'approved' public interaction places between strangers. Also I just simply don't see people or specifically women in my home country walking around clenching their phones, preemptively pretending to be getting calls, and having iPods in their ears at all times when outside even when there's no music playing.

Anyway, I guess this is American society now... at least there's money here.

"Ladies, is this explanation of why cat calling sucks accurate?","A little background: This excerpt is from a transcript of a podcast run by Tucker Max and Dr. Geoffrey Miller (an evolutionary psychologist) that is geared toward dating advice for young men. In it, Tucker and Dr. Miller interview Dr. Carin Perilloux, another evolutionary psychologist, and the topic turns to what women worry about. Cat calling gets brought up.

&gt; Tucker:
&gt; 
&gt; You did a paper on what people worry about? We have this – we go over this again and again and again with guys. What are some things that women worry about that guys just don’t understand or don’t worry about?
&gt; 
&gt; Carin:
&gt; 
&gt; In that paper we didn’t really look at that per se, but anecdotally we can talk about things that…. One of David Buss’ studies was what are things that the opposite sex does that irritate or annoy you and there were like 140 things or something. The number one thing for women was sexual coercion and guys thought, when they were asked, they thought ‘women probably don’t like that’ but they didn’t think it was nearly as problematic as women did. So that’s something I think women worry about a lot. And maybe not explicitly or thinking about it and worrying about it all the time, but it’s something that’s in the back of every woman’s mind, and something that guys really don’t have to think about as much.
&gt; 
&gt; Geoff:
&gt; 
&gt; By sexual coercion we mean guys stalking, harassment, date rape, rape.
&gt; 
&gt; Tucker:
&gt; 
&gt; Clearly rape and date rape. They’re the same thing. You don’t have to call them separate things. All forms of rape. Clearly that, but I think a lot of guys don’t understand sexual coercion, how encompassing, what that means. Forms of harassment, cat calls, whatever. There are some women that don’t mind cat calls but here’s what a lot of guys don’t understand. Tell me if you agree with this, because you’re an attractive woman and you know the research. From your perspective, say you’re walking down the street or whatever, and some guy’s like ‘Hey baby, I want to get up in that ass’ or something. You can tell they’re just a douche yelling at you. You can sit here and say that’s not, that doesn’t bother me, but as I understand it most women, especially when that happens over and over and over, get really, really fucking annoyed with that. It makes sense to me. Does that happen to you or happen to a lot of women that get annoyed with it?
&gt; 
&gt; Carin:
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t know if annoyed is the right word. Maybe you say it’s annoying. But it does trigger something where it’s sort of fearful. Particularly if it’s a group of guys. That’s really scary because to them they think it’s, presumably, most of the time they’re doing it because it’s funny and they want to get a rise out of you or whatever, but to a woman, you don’t know that that’s the underlying motivation. So it’s like ‘Holy crap! What are my resources, where can I go right now?’ That triggers so many things in your head.
&gt; 
&gt; Tucker:
&gt; 
&gt; It triggers a fight or flight response.
&gt; 
&gt; Carin:
&gt; 
&gt; Exactly. And again for the error management reason. Yeah maybe they’re being funny and you should just forget about it and brush it off but on the other hand there’s a huge potential cost…. it’s like after it happens so many times and nothing bad happens but it’s still triggering this horrible response all the time, it turns into annoyance. But for me it’s more, it prompts me to be scared. And maybe I get annoyed that I have to be scared. I don’t want that.
&gt; 
&gt; Tucker:
&gt; 
&gt; Of course. We say this to guys over and over. I mean, how many times have we said this? Number one that women are thinking about when they’re around you, especially meeting you, if they don’t know you, is physical safety. And guys never think of it because guys aren’t worried. I mean “I’m not worried, physical safety, what are you talking about? I’m not going to punch anybody.” She doesn’t know that dude. She doesn’t know that. And until she knows you she can’t know that. And most guys never know that.

Could you kick your husband or BF's butt if you wanted to? How does that affect your relationship?,"Could you kick your husband or boyfriend's butt? Just a hypothetical, I'm sure there would be no reason why you'd want to of course, I'm just saying: ""Could"" you?
If you could, would that affect the relationship dynamic? Even if you say it's no big deal, wouldn't you want to have a man who could protect you instead of the other way around?

My wife could. Easily. I am tall, in fairly good shape and just never been in a fight in my life. When I was in school, I was tall for my age, never went looking for trouble and never 
got any. It helped that my older brother was on the football team too ;)
Adult life came, college, grad school, career… I still just have never been in a situation where I had to defend myself or others. 

My wife has been in a few actual fights in her time, with other girls and with guys. She's been involved with martial arts, fitness and can really handle herself. She looks harmless, 
until you see her move. 

So…we were out last weekend, walking in the city after a play. Two drunk guys were harassing people on the sidewalk. We ended up directly in their path and line of sight. 
They noticed us and were commenting to each other and laughing while looking our way. There was traffic so we couldn't cross the street to avoid them. 
We got lucky because someone they knew came out of a nearby bar, clearly pissed at them about something and they all got into a shouting match while we simply 
walked around them. Still, my first instinct was to tense up slightly while hers was to step slightly ahead of me and assume a subtle ""ready"" posture. She looked more 
annoyed at them than intimidated though. My adrenaline was still up half an hour later. We talked after. I told her that I'd have her back no matter what but realistically, if something 
happened, I'd have no idea what I was doing since it would be my first time. She laughed and said she would show me some moves sometime. She also WISELY told me that
because I have never been in a fight, that I see almost every potential confrontation as an unavoidable fight. She doubted that it would have gotten to that point but was 
ready if it had. She said that I need to get over my fear and invited me to start training. I asked her if it bothered her that she could kick her husband's ass… if she felt 
disappointed since traditionally men protect women. She said it never really entered her mind because she could handle herself. She was attracted to me for other qualities. 
Then she joked that I better watch myself, with a sly smile.

I realize it is 2014 and men and women can do all sorts of things, some better than others. I realize that gender roles are a relic but still, they are part of the world I grew up with 
and it's been a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience to confront them and accept a different dynamic. 

Could you kick your husband or boyfriend's butt? Would YOU be more capable if you were ever in a situation where you had to defend each other from harm? How does that
affect your relationship or doesn't it matter? I'm curious because my wife said there are probably more couples like this than I'd suspect.",AskWomen,2,1395871567.0,35,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/21gbew/could_you_kick_your_husband_or_bfs_butt_if_you/
How should guys respond to seeing women being sexually assaulted/harassed?,"Hey, this whole thing happened for me at a party a few nights ago, and it has been driving me absolutely crazy ever since. I don't know much anything about trigger warnings, but this might be a triggering thing, I know it really upset me. The context is that this guy had been flirting with a girl that I am friends with for the entire night, in a very aggressive and demeaning manner (Think 'The Game' turned up to eleven.), and at one point they hugged, and then he groped her breasts, something he acknowledged himself.

She reacted with shock, as did everyone around, but people (even those that were quickly after outraged) seemed to wave it on. Then after it had sunk in, we started talking to her and trying to comfort her, as she was very upset by the entire ordeal, and said she felt guilty and bad for feeling uncomfortable about his sexual harassment/assault. It was really really awful, and absolutely ruined the evening. When the guy came back and started talking to her again, my girlfriend, also a friend of hers told the guy to back off, and for the most part, he left her alone for the night, aside from repeatedly walking in/around whatever room she was in at the time/glancing at her. It felt like it wasn't my place to intervene, but I was absolutely furious that someone would hurt my friend like that, it's been driving me crazy.

I wanted to intervene, but I find myself at a loss for what action I could have/should have taken that would have not complicated things for my friend. I wanted to speak up for her, or tell the guy to leave, or even physically remove him if he groped her again, but I don't know if that would have helped or made things worse, let alone imply that she can't stick up for herself.

"How do I show an abused woman, I want to date, that she can trust me?","Hello, I'm pretty new to this forum and forums in general. I'll cut to the chase. I'm a 23 year old guy who likes this 25 year old woman. I like her a lot to be honest. 

I'll give a little background on her. She has 2 kids, she has been physically, verbally, and sexually abused in her life. Her real dad walked out on her, her step-dad was verbally and physically abusive. Her first relationship the guy was physically, verbally, and sexually abusive towards her. Her next relationship the guy wanted nothing to do with her while she had her kids around. She has tried suicide in the past.

I met her through while I was hanging out with some of her friends. She asked her friends all about me and I'll admit when I first saw her I was attracted to her. So we hung out that night, her and I did a lot of talking. At the end of the night I told her I had a really good time and asked if I could have her number. She gave me it and I told her I'd talk to her later.

So we start hanging out and talking to each other a lot, via phone or text messaging. Anytime I am around she is nothing but smiles, giggles, and always cuddles up to me. She said she told her mom about me and her mom wants to meet me. I asked her if that was a good thing and she said yes, because she never tells her mom about stuff like this. She said she really likes me a lot and that I'm so sweet and kind. She did remark one time though that I scared her because she's never met anyone like me. She also talks to her friends about if I'm being real or if this nice guy thing is just a front, she asks them a lot from what they've said. 

So things are going along really well and we are text messaging each other on Sunday just talking about things, and she is laughing and just flirting back and forth etc. Well she said she was going to bed and I told her goodnight sweet cheeks I'll talk to you tomorrow. I got up on Monday and sent her a text saying good morning, how are you doing. She didn't answer so I figured she is busy with work etc. She calls me then at 5:15, I couldn't talk because I was at work so I told her that via text messaging and asked if everything was alright? She said she needed me to call her because she had to talk to me. I called her and ask what's going on and she starts with, ""It's not you it's me, I have issues I need to workout right now and I'm so sorry, but you are such a great guy etc."" I was baffled.

I didn't know what to say. I text her on Tuesday telling her I'd been thinking about her all day, which is true, and if it'd be okay if I called. She said there was nothing to talk about and she didn't want to talk and that she was sorry. I responded with I just want to get to know you and I'm not an asshole and I'm not going to hurt you and I just want to get to know you more is all. She responded back with very incoherent sentences and said she wants to be left alone among other things.

I am a nice guy and I love being around this girl. She's so smart, funny, gorgeous, sassy, I just like her so much. I don't know what to do. I've thought about going up there, but I'm afraid that will scare her. I thought about writing her a hand-written letter, but I've been told I shouldn't do that. I was told not to get pushy with her and just leave her alone. I just want to show her that I care about her and that I'll be there and I'll never hurt her. I've been sick over this since Monday and I'm going crazy because I do not know what to do. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions as to what I can do? My gut tells me to do one thing, but everyone warns against it. I don't want to screw this help and any advice or help would be so appreciated.

TL;DR
I like this woman a lot, she has been physically, verbally, and sexually abused by every male figure in her life basically. She is scared and she doesn't trust me so she cut contact with me on Monday and told me to leave her alone. I want to be with this girl a lot and I don't know what I have to do to show her she can trust me. I know she likes me from what she has said. I'm looking for help.

Do you find the public treatment of breast cancer awareness disgusting or healthy?,"Of course there is no right or wrong answer to this. I'm just asking for other perspectives out there. Now for some context:

My best friend is doing a university art project in which she and a partner picked a topic that meant a lot to them, and then swapped to allow their partner to create their own work expressing their feelings on the topic. The topic her partner picked for her was breast cancer and breast cancer awareness. So she and I were chatting about it and our feelings on the subject, and we seem to feel completely the opposite. I'll paste a piece of our conversation here, but I wanted to check with others who might have breast cancer themselves or have a near and dear loved one who is going through it and ask their feelings on the matter. I know men are capable of getting breast cancer too, but since a male's chance of dying from it is statistically about 1/10th the chance of a female's, all of the public talk about it seems to focus on women, which is why I came to this subreddit for this.

&gt;Her: She gave me breast cancer, and one of those little pink ribbons. Breast cancer pisses me off. Its all pink ribbons, smiling, laughing women, pink buses, pink decorating runs, all this shit. It just feels so glorified. But it's awful. It's this horrible disease that kills people and destroys families. But I feel like that's a tender point, and maybe people close to it don't want to look at it that way. Maybe they like celebrating it? So I've been struggling to consolidate how I feel with what's socially acceptable. And last night I came across with forum of breast cancer survivors pouring their hearts out about their experience and how much they hate the glorification of it all, and how much they hate the pink ribbon. Just have me the confidence and reassurance to go down that path. So I started playing with it last night. Destroying the ribbon, mixing it with hair (hair loss being a huge part of chemo and part of the experience for Lorna's mum, but loose hair no longer attached to people is generally considered pretty gross).

&gt;Me: I just imagine if I was going through that. Or if god forbid it were to take you or my mom away from me, that whole celebration of it would keep me from feeling alone, regardless of knowing that I actually wasn't alone. And I know it's just my bias, but that's why I imagine the celebration is there. Working in retail back in October really got me into it. Donating, wanting to raise awareness...

&gt;Her: See to me it's just this horrific reminder. People smiling and dancing about an extremely traumatic event. Plus I'm finding the ""awareness"" thing really hard to buy.

&gt;Me: I don't think anyone who goes through it is able to forget about it no matter how hard they try, not healthily anyway. It being out of mind is kind of a luxury for those of us who don't have to deal with it in some way. I would think it's better to embrace it and turn it into a positive thing to get you through it and keep you from just breaking down and losing it at the fact that you or a loved one is very really likely to be gone. When there's really nothing you can do to prevent that. I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings. Just trying to look at the whole thing differently.

&gt;Her: Yeah, I realise my take on it isn't going to be a popular one, but I do feel that it's fair. I'll always remember the hard things I've gone through, but walking down the street seeing them be celebrated would be very difficult for me.

"Ladies who've been sexually harassed, how did you get over it?","I live in Seoul, South Korea and was just harassed about a couple hours ago (11 pm) in an enclosed alley where my apartment is.  I was on the phone with my boyfriend walking back to my apartment, turned into the alley and had the weirdest feeling that someone was following me.  I turned around and sure enough, someone was. Ten feet away from me.  He was waddling toward me with his pants around his ankles jerking off.  He then stops waddling and just stands there doing his thing.  There's no one else around.  I reached for my keys and positioned them between my fingers Wolverine-style in case he tried to attack me.  My apartment was still a 20-second walk from where I was.  I started to walk backwards (still facing him) for obvious reasons  and told him to stop following me.  He pulled his pants back up and continued to slowly walk towards me.  Realizing that I was still walking backward while keeping my eyes on him, he stopped, took off his pants AGAIN and went at it AGAIN with his dick.  At the time, I felt like I was left with the options of 1. Do I face forward, run to my apartment and risk being potentially attacked from behind or 2. Keep facing him and walk backward knowing he's probably getting off on it?  I chose option 2. 

In the end, he got off on my fear.  He won, I lost.  He now knows where I live and can/will probably target me again because I just 'took it' the first time. I know how to react next time: Curse, scream, maybe carry a fork in my purse from now on (a friend that I spoke to about this says she carries around a fork for protection) and scare him off instead of being scared and submissive.

**TL;DR: Walked down a secluded alley at night and was mentally and emotionally defeated by a guy who simultaneously waddled towards me and man-handled his mini tootsie roll.**

"Would you consider ""gawking"" sexual harrassment in the workplace?","I apologize in advance if this is not the correct venue for this question.

About a month ago, my workplace hired a guy who has had prior experience in the field. I was immediately put off by him because he's extraordinarily arrogant; the type that *must* be right. Always.

I'm 27 years old. I work 2-10:30 pm M-F at a local hotel. Prior to going into the hotel I work at a school as an elementary teacher. I don't carry my hotel uniform with me, rather, I leave it at work and change when I arrive for my shift for convenience (and wrinkle) purposes. Because I leave my uniform for the next day, I change back into my street/teaching clothes before I go home for the night. I really don't think it matters what I wear or my physical type for my experience to be any less ""serious"". 

Anyhoo...I have noticed him gawking at me as I leave for home at the end of the night and, as he's night auditor, I can't avoid seeing him unless I leave 30-45 minutes early from each shift (which, I can't do for monetary purposes as well as respect for my manager). Because this has happened a minimum of 10 times, I have asked him to stop, I have mentioned to my manager that I refuse to speak to him/be in the same room as him unless it is absolutely necessary and job related and, I stated *why* this is the case. 

I am so terribly uncomfortable around him and I know several other girls at work feel the same way, but they're not willing to risk causing problems to fix this. Ex: Another female co-worker had an experience where he called her fat to her face. She *did* talk to the manager and the ""issue was solved"" by having every employee watch a YouTube video on sexual harrassment. His behavior has not changed whatsoever.

I feel as though these two unresolved experiences alone are reason enough to report and/or file for sexual harrassment. Agree or disagree? Help.",AskWomen,8,1360022303.0,27,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/17wdar/would_you_consider_gawking_sexual_harrassment_in/
"Do you try to withhold making any expression, and avoid making eye contact when walking past strangers on the street?","I ask this because it seems that as I am about to walk past someone on the street (mainly noticed this with women), and take a quick glance. Women tend to look slightly uncomfortable like they are purposely trying to avoid eye contact (trying hard to stare straight ahead, or turning their head away at the last second) and hold back in making any expression (I can tell in because it looks forced and kind of awkward for them).
I am a 27 year old male and it makes me confused and feel like I have an unpleasant appearance (even though I don't look dangerous).

How do I reduce my junkie-like excessive need for male approval?,"I have a serious problem when I am around men - if i'm in the street or a store... anywhere... which is that I look to see if they think I am attractive and if they don't then I feel like i've been punched in the stomach - completely worthless. I have to start off by saying that I am considered ugly by men who have told me this in the street, in person etc. I am however, presentable - it is my face. The last time I was insulted very aggressively, I stopped wearing eyeliner and just felt there was no point in even bothering anymore. I feel better not putting on make up and getting abuse than making a lot of effort and getting abuse. In the past few years i'd say the comments have died down to the point where I only hear some men say things about me every so often to their friends ('that's your girlfriend' followed by laughter etc.) but it hurts and I still feel I need their acceptance. It feels like a form of OCD to me where I am constantly ""checking"" in with them to see what my worth is. I would like to be able to pass men in the street and not notice/care about who they are looking at. Has anyone ever been like this and successfully 'undone' this habit? How?

Background: father present but neglectful/rude/boorish. I have had boyfriends but they were also neglectful people who i placed at the centre of the relationship. I know enough to choose well in future if I choose to be in a relationship again but it's not my priority. I just want to walk in the street and not feel anxiety. At this present time I just make myself avoid looking at them. 

I would also like to be even more presentable and look more stylish however how can I accomplish this without making it about men? If I wear make up and men look then I will feel ""high"" like i'm on a drug and my appearance will be about them then when they don't look, I will come crashing down. 

Also if a woman looks away from me, I don't feel bad (even if she called me ugly, i wouldn't care) however I have never been insulted in the street by a woman and women treat me like a human being. With men it is as if I either don't exist or I am a nuisance who is in their way.

I am in my 30s so I should have dealt with this but I haven't. It's like a drug.",AskWomen,27,1428577407.0,20,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/31zhma/how_do_i_reduce_my_junkielike_excessive_need_for/
I have not been in a relationship since high school. I am a man in his thirties. What should I do?,"A little background on myself for relevance.

I have not been in a relationship since I was in high school and am now in my thirties. It was the only relationship I have been in and was a virgin before that. I was a very quiet antisocial straight A kid with family problems and was bullied at school. The relationship was your typical high school kind of thing and ended when she cheated on me. Basically just kids being kids. After that I was a bit jaded and didn't have anything to do with women for a few years. I had enough to deal with in terms of things like sick parents followed by drug addiction, dropping out of school, and a whole lot of other things I'd rather not talk about. My childhood was not pleasant and I'll leave it at that. 

For years after that the majority of interaction I had with women had been one night stands, not because I was pursuing them but because they would pursue me. I became an alcoholic with very low self esteem. That coupled with my drug addiction and all the other things I was still dealing with at that time and it was a very dark point in my life. I began to objectify women like they were doing to me, probably just thinking that was normal and began to pursue them only for sex. After a while there were a few girls I began to see regularly but nothing I would consider to be a relationship and I never really had an emotional connection with them. They were as troubled as I was and a lot of drugs and alcohol were involved. Things progressively got worse and suicide was a daily thought.

Eventually some things happened that made me begin to really try and get my life together and cut myself off from everyone I had known. After a very long time and a lot of hard work fast forward to the present. I have long since conquered my addictions and overcame all the shit life had piled on top of me. I'm confident, happy, and healthy. I'm not horribly wealthy but live a good life that I find fulfilling. Attractive intelligent women frequently show genuine interest  in me and I have no problems approaching them. My problem Is that I really don't know what to do at this point. I've had a few innocent flings with girls over the years but nothing serious. 

I've never taken a girl on a date or tried to pursue a relationship since I wasn't ready yet so things, as you could imagine are a bit awkward for me. If I start wanting a relationship with someone or begin to have feelings I tend to back off and lose my confidence because of this. And let's face it if I brought up the fact I haven't been in a relationship since high school that's pretty much going to kill things on the spot. I've overcome a lot and have learned to be happy by myself but I'm ready to move on with my life and find someone to share it with. I'm a fairly private person and have no one to really ask for advice because I've cut myself off from my past. I've pretty much had to reinvent myself from the ground up to escape it. My friends ironically just tend to think I'm very promiscuous because I never have a girlfriend and get more attention than them.

So the question/questions would be how should I, as a man in his thirties go about pursuing a relationship with someone? I'm fine up until the point where I want something more than just friendship or something casual. What should I be doing? Nothing really comes very naturally to me because I've missed out on so many experiences. It's not like I can be dating people close to my age trying to figure these things out like we were kids. What would be normal? How much should I avoid talking about my past? Pretty much any advice that may help me move forward. I'm sorry if this seams a bit silly but it's the last big hurdle I have left for me to feel like I've finally moved beyond my past.

Need to make sure I'm not totally off base here.,"Tonight, I spent the evening with a delightful young lady, and we had a wonderful time.  Unfortunately, our evening ended less cordially than it had went earlier.

I'm waiting for the bus with her that will take her to the place to catch the shuttle back to her school.  The bus comes to the stop, but she's standing at the wrong door.  Before she can get to the right door, the driver shuts the door and drives away.  This was the last bus of the night.  Needless to say, I'm outraged.

She pulls out her iPhone and calculates that she's 2.5 miles from where she needs to get to.  She figures that she'll just walk.  

Public transit is basically closed (this notorious college city has the bright idea to close everything right around midnight).  It's after 1 AM.  She wants to walk alone for two and a half miles at 1 AM in an (admittedly well-lit, but bar-dotted) area she is not familiar with.  She figures that she knows how to take care of herself, and that nothing's going to happen, and that I shouldn't act this way just because she's female (freshmen, huh?).

It goes without saying that I am extremely reluctant to let this happen. A good man does not let a woman walk that far in the dark and the cold on a Friday night after 1 AM.  It takes some real cajoling (by the end of which she was somewhat pissed with me), but I convince her to take a cab to her shuttle stop.

This is a special girl.  This was our first time spending together, but I think we both see real potential for something here.  I feel bad for being a bit of an ass about this.  But I would feel far worse waiting for her to tell me she got to her stop safely for over an hour, and I would have a hard time living with myself if something were to happen to her.  That, and the second thing her friends would have done if something had happened would have been to come for my man bits.

I also insisted that she let me pay for dinner next time to make up for how the evening ended.

I don't think I'm off base, but I haven't had the chance to ask any females yet.  I did good, right?  You ladies would have come for my man bits if I had let her walk all that way alone, wouldn't you?",AskWomen,0,1354345760.0,26,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/143fnv/need_to_make_sure_im_not_totally_off_base_here/
Why do women look down when they pass me on the street?,"If I'm walking alone on the street and I pass by a woman under ~30 walking alone, she tends to look down. Sometimes the eyes, sometimes the entire head.

I'd like to know why. Girls, do you ever notice yourself looking down when you pass a guy, and why? I'll provide some details to clarify what's going on.

When wearing sunglasses I've checked. They often look up at me right as they pass by, but not before. After they pass by, they lift their head (I've looked behind to check).

I'm 27, handsome, lean, and muscular. Fairly well dressed. When I got really lean last summer, I noticed a lot more girls turning their head down as opposed to just their eyes. 

I'm also short, 5'6"", basically eye level with a lot of the girls looking down. 

Basically I'm trying to figure out if these girls are shy and attracted to me, or if I look intimidating. Could be a bit of both.

Almost all girls walking alone do this to some extent. If a girl is walking with someone else, she doesn't. If I do make eye contact with a girl, she looks down again (as opposed to away or up, which usually indicated neutrality and disdain, respectively)

This may seem like a weird question, but it happens *every* time I go outside for a walk and I'd love to figure out what's going on. 

**Edit:** Thanks for the answers. I should clarify that it's not just about them not making eye contact. It's that they look down, including with their whole head.

When I was less muscular girls would look straight ahead, or away, or up. They never do that now. They'll look straight ahead sometimes, but mostly down.",AskWomen,2,1365349779.0,25,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1buudq/why_do_women_look_down_when_they_pass_me_on_the/
I don't want to be scary! How do I not scare female people I end up walking behind at night?,"Scene: this evening, San Francisco, near CVS.
Enter me. 6'4"" lumberjack looking bearded fellow.  Internally, a perfectly kind individual (hopefully). Externally, a speedy walker and hulking presence.

Twice tonight, once on the way to CVS and once on the way back, it was clear to me that I made the female person walking ahead of me uncomfortable.  Like looking over their shoulder, talking on their cell phone, speeding up their walk type stuff.  

This happens all the time to me. I don't want to be scary.  Current strategies I have:

Slow down my speed, stop completely and wait, or walk around the block to go in a different direction.  Look at the sky, etc. But sometimes I'm in a rush and can't do this.

Cross the street and walk on that side.  Feels really awkward.

Speed up and pash them, so slight increased stress for them, followed by relief.

I hate that people respond to me this way! What can I do to make my presence less intimidating?

I need help to find if she likes me or if I have a good chance with her.,"Hello, I have been in this subreddit for about 2-3 days and i have seen really good stuff that help me. but I need your help (if you can) to see if i have a good chance with her, so lets start:
ok for some background info, I have met her for about 4 months now, she is a freshman in High School and I am a Sophomore. We have 1 class together and that is Geometry.

I want to have a ""more than friends relationship"" with her, but i need help because i have never had a gf before. But anyways, her and I are really comfortable with each other , we have really good conversations when texting (i always or most of the time start the conv.) I think i have good chance with her because she really enjoys (I feel) whenever I talk to her or text her, she always laugh at almost everything I say or do, and well we just have a god time.

Now one thing too, is that we only see each other/talk during school about 2 times 3 if lucky, she is the one that starts the conversation always (at school). Now, i feel that I can talk to her way more during school because i see her walking down the hall alone for most of the time, to go to her other classes, but its just i guess im really shy and have Approach Anxiety and I also over-analyse stuff like: what if she is having a bad day or if she just doesnt want to talk right now? 

But anyways, I text her every 2 days and when i do we are like texting back and forth for about 3-4.5 hours. It seems like she likes my personality and is comfortable with it (im really funny, random,good-looking,and can socialize well) 

for example about 3 days ago i texted her this:
*Me: Guess what?!!?!!!*
*Her:Whhhaatttt?*
*Me:I've been meditating.. And.... Out of all the (lets call her)Mikayla's in the world.... I think your my favorite!!*
*Her:Omg!!!!! I am so honored!!!! Lol*
*Me:Cool!! It's good to feel honored from time to time ... Good for ur health*
*Her:Lmbo!!! Okay dr Sw0rdsman!*
*Me:Yup you know it!! Ur favorite Dr. Right hurr!!!*
*Her:Yeshhhhhhhh!!!*

And the next her I texted her this:
*Me:Just a small town girl ...*
*Her:Living in a lonely world!!*
*Me:Hahah!!! Lol I really thought u were gonna go like huh ? Lol nice follow up!*
*Her:Tanx!!!*

So that is just part of it, at the end of the day we ended up with a good note and saying good night to each other. That is what normally goes on with the conversations sometimes i put a lil more flirting into it and she responds really well.

Can you (if you can, from a woman's point of view) give me some tips maybe that I can make her feel a lil more attracted to me, because sometimes she doesnt seem but then the next day she seems more interested in me. Also do u think maybe im stepping into the ""freindzone"" because that is my biggest fears right now with her, and if i am almost there what can i do to try to get back in to the ""he seems attractive"" type of deal?

Do you ever feel chivalry or indignation when a woman mistreats a man in public?,"Last week's ""What's the worst date you've ever gone on thread"" had the story of a woman who went on a movie date with a guy that kept trying to push physical boundaries too quickly. She walked out to the lobby and he followed her and tried to hold her back. The woman then made a scene when he wouldn't listen and she stated something in the thread to the effect of, ""[Her reaction] got a few tough-looking guys in the theater lobby to look at them, and their facial expressions said 'If this guy gives you anymore trouble we'll take care of him for you.'""

This made me wonder if women respond in similar ways if the situation is reversed. Obviously social norms dictate men shouldn't physically harm women unless their lives, family or health are in danger (and the last one is questionable). If he does without these conditions, nearby guys will come up go to town on him. But if a guy is getting harassed in public by some woman who won't leave him alone, do nearby females have a ""Is this girl giving you trouble? I'll handle her for you"" instinct for random guys?

"Askwomen: I read this story, it gave me some views that i didn't know but i acknowledge now (as a male). I would just like to know what you all think about this story?","When I got home that night as my wife served dinner, I held her hand and said, I've got something to tell you. She sat down and ate quietly. Again I observed the hurt in her eyes.

Suddenly I didn't know how to open my mouth. But I had to let her know what I was thinking. I want a divorce. I raised the topic calmly.

She didn't seem to be annoyed by my words, instead she asked me softly, why?

I avoided her question. This made her angry. She threw away the chopsticks and shouted at me, you are not a man! That night, we didn't talk to each other. She was weeping. I knew she wanted to find out what had happened to our marriage. But I could hardly give her a satisfactory answer; she had lost my heart to Jane. I didn't love her anymore. I just pitied her!

With a deep sense of guilt, I drafted a divorce agreement which stated that she could own our house, our car, and 30% stake of my company.

She glanced at it and then tore it into pieces. The woman who had spent ten years of her life with me had become a stranger. I felt sorry for her wasted time, resources and energy but I could not take back what I had said for I loved Jane so dearly. Finally she cried loudly in front of me, which was what I had expected to see. To me her cry was actually a kind of release. The idea of divorce which had obsessed me for several weeks seemed to be firmer and clearer now.

The next day, I came back home very late and found her writing something at the table. I didn't have supper but went straight to sleep and fell asleep very fast because I was tired after an eventful day with Jane.

When I woke up, she was still there at the table writing. I just did not care so I turned over and was asleep again.

In the morning she presented her divorce conditions: she didn't want anything from me, but needed a month's notice before the divorce. She requested that in that one month we both struggle to live as normal a life as possible. Her reasons were simple: our son had his exams in a month's time and she didn't want to disrupt him with our broken marriage.

This was agreeable to me. But she had something more, she asked me to recall how I had carried her into our bridal room on our wedding day.

She requested that every day for the month's duration I carry her out of our bedroom to the front door ever morning. I thought she was going crazy. Just to make our last days together bearable I accepted her odd request.

I told Jane about my wife's divorce conditions. She laughed loudly and thought it was absurd. No matter what tricks she applies, she has to face the divorce, she said scornfully.

My wife and I hadn't had any body contact since my divorce intention was explicitly expressed. So when I carried her out on the first day, we both appeared clumsy. Our son clapped behind us, daddy is holding mommy in his arms. His words brought me a sense of pain. From the bedroom to the sitting room, then to the door, I walked over ten meters with her in my arms. She closed her eyes and said softly; don't tell our son about the divorce. I nodded, feeling somewhat upset. I put her down outside the door. She went to wait for the bus to work. I drove alone to the office.

On the second day, both of us acted much more easily. She leaned on my chest. I could smell the fragrance of her blouse. I realized that I hadn't looked at this woman carefully for a long time. I realized she was not young any more. There were fine wrinkles on her face, her hair was graying! Our marriage had taken its toll on her. For a minute I wondered what I had done to her.

On the fourth day, when I lifted her up, I felt a sense of intimacy returning. This was the woman who had given ten years of her life to me.

On the fifth and sixth day, I realized that our sense of intimacy was growing again. I didn't tell Jane about this. It became easier to carry her as the month slipped by. Perhaps the everyday workout made me stronger.

She was choosing what to wear one morning. She tried on quite a few dresses but could not find a suitable one. Then she sighed, all my dresses have grown bigger. I suddenly realized that she had grown so thin, that was the reason why I could carry her more easily.

Suddenly it hit me... she had buried so much pain and bitterness in her heart. Subconsciously I reached out and touched her head.

Our son came in at the moment and said, Dad, it's time to carry mom out. To him, seeing his father carrying his mother out had become an essential part of his life. My wife gestured to our son to come closer and hugged him tightly. I turned my face away because I was afraid I might change my mind at this last minute. I then held her in my arms, walking from the bedroom, through the sitting room, to the hallway. Her hand surrounded my neck softly and naturally. I held her body tightly; it was just like our wedding day.

But her much lighter weight made me sad. On the last day, when I held her in my arms I could hardly move a step. Our son had gone to school. I held her tightly and said, I hadn't noticed that our life lacked intimacy.

I drove to office.... jumped out of the car swiftly without locking the door. I was afraid any delay would make me change my mind...I walked upstairs. Jane opened the door and I said to her, Sorry, Jane, I do not want the divorce anymore.

She looked at me, astonished, and then touched my forehead. Do you have a fever? She said. I moved her hand off my head. Sorry, Jane, I said, I won't divorce. My marriage life was boring probably because she and I didn't value the details of our lives, not because we didn't love each other anymore. Now I realize that since I carried her into my home on our wedding day I am supposed to hold her until death do us apart.

Jane seemed to suddenly wake up. She gave me a loud slap and then slammed the door and burst into tears. I walked downstairs and drove away.

At the floral shop on the way, I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my wife. The salesgirl asked me what to write on the card. I smiled and wrote, I'll carry you out every morning until death do us apart.

That evening I arrived home, flowers in my hands, a smile on my face, I run up stairs, only to find my wife in the bed - dead. My wife had been fighting CANCER for months and I was so busy with Jane to even notice. She knew that she would die soon and she wanted to save me from the whatever negative reaction from our son, in case we push thru with the divorce — at least, in the eyes of our son — I'm a loving husband...

The small details of your lives are what really matter in a relationship. It is not the mansion, the car, property, the money in the bank. These create an environment conducive for happiness but cannot give happiness in themselves. So find time to be your spouse's friend and do those little things for each other that build intimacy. Do have a real happy marriage!

Can some ladies shed some light on what the hell happened to me the other night?,"22 year old male virgin here. I am not completely clueless about women, just inexperienced. I think I've made a lot of progress over the past 2 or 3 years but I am still no lady killer. Anyways heres the story:

Im travelling through Europe right now, backpacking by myself, staying in hostels and what not. I am generally pretty shy, but a few nights ago I met up with an old friend in Poland and one thing led to another. I ended up meeting some of his friends friends friends, next thing I know I am on a college campus at a party. I meet this girl, Ill call her ""M"". I get a lot more social when I drink, and thats exactly what happened. We are hitting it off quite well. Somebody suggest we go to the club, Im all for that. Im pretty buzzed and feeling pretty confident. I get restless and grab her hand and playfully pull her away suggesting its time to go. She laughs, agrees, and were on our way. The rest of the group slowly starts following, but were ahead of them by a minute or so. She puts here arm around my waist, so im like ""fuck it"" and put my arm around her shoulder. Were walking down this path, side by side, flirting and whatnot, its kind of dark with not to many people around. She suggest we stop and wait for the others. I pull her into a little clearing off to the side that is dark. We start making out. Everything is going great. The rest of the group catches up and we continue on our way. The walk is about 30 min, the whole time were holding hands and kissing a lot. I will say that she was a little drunk, but still totally coherent. She stopped drinking after we left though so she would only have gotten more sober as the night went on. I ask her what she is doing tomorrow, it doesn't sound like much so I ask her if she wants to hang out. She did seem a little reluctant, but eventually she agrees and and gives me her number. We get to the club and for the rest of the night we have a great time. We kissed *alot*, danced quite a bit, got to know each other more, laughed together, and there was a lot of intense eye contact. I had every reason to believe this girl actually liked me. On the dance floor I was grabbing her ass quite a bit, and even rubbed her between the legs a little. If that doesn't tell me she is into me, I dont know what does. Eventually the place closes down and we have to leave. We walk outside together and make out some more. We talked some more about meeting the next day a little more before she leaves. I go back to the hostel and can hardly sleep I am so excited. 
When I wake up I just lie there waiting for her to text me. Finally she does, and this is what it says: ""Hey, I cant meet you today, its complicated. You should go to Warsaw"". ( I had told her I was going to Warsaw that day before we made plans). I just layed there in shock and disappointment for 20 min. I cannot figure out what happened, we left on a really good note and she seemed to really like me.
So can I get some insight into what happened, how I screwed this up? 

The best I can think of is that she realized that since I was a tourist, I wouldn't have been around for more than a few days. She wasn't looking for a one night stand because she isn't that kind of girl, and obviously a long term relationship would be impossible. Maybe she figured that meeting up with me wouldn't really go anywhere good.

Have you ever been to a bar alone? What was it like?,"I'm asking this in /r/askwomen because, while I feel this is something that might be considered slightly weird for either gender, it might be considered less socially acceptable for women. My social life is in kind of a weird place right now, but I'm trying to get out of the house more, even if it means going alone. So far I've kept it to things like shopping, taking walks, coffee shops, cafes, etc. but I figure...why not a bar? There are a couple more laid-back bars in my neighborhood (I'd never go to a loud clubby place alone...lol), and I'm trying to gauge how weird it would be to just go have a drink and maybe read a book or something or chat casually with people.

So if you've done this, what was it like? Was it a happy hour thing or at night? Did you get hit on? If you were in an awkward situation, how did you get out of it? Were you afraid that someone might follow you home because you were alone? Have you ever made friends this way? Do you think people consider it less socially acceptable for women?",AskWomen,14,1354232370.0,15,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/140su3/have_you_ever_been_to_a_bar_alone_what_was_it_like/
How do we(M) show/tell you that we don't want to rape you when walking along the street at night?,"I(M) always encounter this at night where I would be walking down the street, heading home. Along the way I would notice that there is a woman quite far ahead of me. As I get closer to her (because I'm a quick walker) she would look at me all funny and then cross the road, and glance at me occasionally (or stare, I know you do it I can feel it sometimes) to check that I'm not doing anything weird. It makes everything awkward. Making me feel uncomfortable because she's uncomfortable. 

And I can't just say ""Don't worry, I'm not going to rape you"" because that makes it very suspicious. Even asking this question on Reddit makes it suspicious.

It really is a grey area, I think. What do we do to make it seem a lot less uncomfortable?

Girlfriend of 6 months is still 'good' friends with her ex-boyfriend of 3 years. Female perspective is much appreciated...,"My girlfriend and her ex of 3 years (lived together for 2 of those) broke up earlier this year. She(23) and I(28) started dating 6 months ago and are currently 2 hours apart, so when there is time and no other engagements, we usually see each other every weekend. The distance is temporary based on my action in the next 2 months; we'd both be in school until summer, and near each other. Anyways she came into the city this weekend for basically the first time since she moved. We spent the night together last night, and then she had family and other errands to run today (Saturday). I know she still talks to her ex occasionally, and on Friday when she came into town she told me she had plans to meet her ex/his mom (3 years...) the next day. 

I told her I didn't feel good about that but we're both pretty reasonable, so she understood that it sucks for me, but doesn't feel it's necessary (indeed, she made the stand that she *won't*) cut off the friendship for a relationship. She totally understands where I'm coming from and admits it is a hard situation. I told her sorry if that is the ape-part of me, but it's just how I feel, emotions-wise. She has said the friendship is completely platonic (several references/statements over the past few months). Apparently, it ended mutually and they weren't in love with each other any more, they weren't having fun anymore. Etc. When I inquired a while back whether there was a potential that she'd want to get back together she said, ""No. We broke up for very specific reasons and I would not go back to that"".

So. I suck it up and decide to worry about it later. Well, last night *was* later and I found myself getting increasingly bothered by it over the day. She was only going to over and see him and his mother (I assume her ex lives with his Mom, only sort of relevant) with her dog, etc. Basically a catch-up session I reckon, didn't get total details. I sent her a premature text asking ""uh..how was it"" and she told me she was heading there and text afterwards. In the meantime, I found my mind wondering what they were doing, how she was with another man, and an ex no-less, on a Saturday night instead of me (even though we hung out the night before/that morning), etc. These thoughts come in and my emotions and my logical/reasonableness start conflicting emotions that are really hard to deal with.

Okay. 2.5ish hours later I get a text.

""Did you end up getting back to sleep""

""Yes. What are you doing."" 

""Lucky. Super tired, heading home (we didn't sleep much the night prior, long day, no sex jokes please). You?""

""Honestly trying not to be upset""

Then I called her. I we talked for about an hour about it -- she understands my position, has totally been there in the past, and was very understanding in the phonecall. My emotions about it and her understanding but not *being in my position* (and, indeed, me nor in hers) went in circles throughout the conversation. Basic premise:

M: **I don't want to the the kind of boyfriend who tells you you can't hang out with friends. But it really bothers me because you have a sexual and romantic past (I haven't actually said those last sexual/romantic comments yet, even though that's the real issue here.) with your ex and when you spend time together it make me feel really shitty inside.**

F: **I Understand that and totally get it, but i'm not going to sacrifice a friendship for a relationship. I want us to work through it but it's a hard situation for both of us, because I don't want to hurt you unintentionally.**

*(Sidenote: Apparently she doesn't feel sexual jealousy when it comes to me. She does have some bisexuality in her past, so I just thought that might be a reason. But she has felt it in the past, so maybe not. Anyways she doesn't know if it's a change in her ""philosophy"" of dating or if it's just with me because she's so comfortable/secure [what she has said]. So there's that in the basket as well.- She ""understands"" but claims to not relate any more.)*

While I was in the process of trying to come to terms with this idea, as it may be a semi-yearly (hopefully not more) occurrence, she told me (admittedly maybe not the best time but in the sake of full disclosure) her ex also plans on visiting her in the small (beautiful) town a couple hours away where she goes to school, a town which I have been trying to move to for some schooling as well. 

""To stay the night?""

"" Yes --- Well I would probably stay at my dads..."" (block away)

I obviously have a problem with her ex boyfriend coming to visit her alone (I guess I could open up the possibility of meeting him -- up until now I don't want to, I don't want his image in my head of their past together) and presumably stay overnight while they apparently walk around together and do stuff for a day or two. This just doesn't feel good to me, and I'm going to make a note her to ask why he is coming up to visit -- he lives in this state, and he can go to this town any time. Surely he has been there before...i digress.


*I just don't know how to feel.* She was very understanding on the phone and did not make me feel like shit (intentionally) for wanting to talk it out. She has offered to talk with me about it if it helps, or also offered not to talk about it if I'd rather sort it out myself.  Honestly, she's the most reasonable (in discussions -- I refuse to fight/argue loudly) and beautiful woman I have ever met, we get along so well, I'm absolutely in love with her , which is why I am: 

A. Having such a problem with her consistently (although likely every few months) seeing an ex-boyfriend on a friendship basis and

B. Why I am trying to hard to make personal concessions to make the relationship work, and be reasonable about my emotions about it.

*I should make it a point to say that we are very much attracted to each other, she cares about me a lot, knows I am in love with her, she is falling in love with me but not quite ""in love"" yet because of some of the issues of the year, probably the fact that she is still dealing with the loss of that relationship a bit, on top of getting into a new one relatively soon (3-4 months), though they had kind of been just friends for a while near the end. She was the first one to say ""I think i'm falling in love with you"". That was 3-4 months ago. No real update other than ""still falling.""*

*I should also make a note that I have never caught her in a lie, she is very (sometimes brutally) honest about everything, and there is no reason for me to doubt what she has told me about this ex-gentleman is true. She has done nothing intentionally to make me doubt my trust in her. While I have my own baggage from the past about girlfriends/exes, I am trying to come to terms with the idea that what she says **is actually fact**, it's just so hard to determine when emotions/relationships are involved.*

So be my frame of reference, /r/AskWomen: Do I have a right to disagree with these actions, or am I wrong, or what's the gray area? It is a very complex question and I need to try to sort my emotions on the matter. I want to be a good, understanding boyfriend, but I don't know if my emotions have a case here. Do they, given what you know about the situation? Or do I need to be okay with this? I have no exes who I am ""good friends"" with (the long-term ones and I don't talk, too many feels), so I don't have a frame of reference to what I would do in her shoes, or if this is something that I should be more okay with.

**TL;DR - My current girlfriend is still good (platonic) friends with her ex-boyfriend of 3 years. They still talk sometimes, hung out earlier this evening, and he's planning on visiting her in the town she just moved to, the both of them alone. Didn't ask when. This bothers me A LOT inside because of the implications of the matter, but am trying to be reasonable about it and a good boyfriend. She has been honest and forthright about the situation, has proven trustworthy and I would like to completely, 100% trust her and hope it is as she says. But it's very hard to do.**

**Post-Script:** I wrote this out last night after we talked on the phone. Today, she came over before heading back and we talked a bit about it, only to reach a headway. Everytime I suggested the possibility/worry of there still being feelings between them, she met it with resistance -- she hasn't said anything like that, and is honest enough that I truly believe she would tell me if that was going to be an issue. She also said that nothing has changed since she saw him yesterday -- nor was she expecting it to. It seems just a friendship that used to be a relationship. After, uh, the following intimacy, wrapped up in the throes of post-coitus, I told her I would try to work through it and be okay with it. Maybe trusting her makes me a sucker, but as I have said she has given me no reason to not trust her, and I think most of my insecurities come from past baggage (we all have it) and how ""these types of dramas"" play out in the movies and TV -- very poorly. I feel like I would rather be a sucker than an untrusting boyfriend. ",AskWomen,2,1350862631.0,15,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/11v8i4/girlfriend_of_6_months_is_still_good_friends_with/
"22 y/o male, haven't even had my first kiss yet. Help? ","i posted this a while back on /r/seduction (i know some you of you dislike those guys) and got some half decent advice. Now i'm just asking for the female perspective. 

K, I'm a 22 year old who's quite good looking (I think). I'm 186cm (6'1""), slim, palish skin, dark hair. i'm a loner and rarely had any friends. I mean i talk to my fellow classmates and co-workers at school and stuff but i've never had any real friends. I have zero social skills, i'm akward, shy, quiet, and a social outcast. I also can't speak in front of public, get nervous when i'm on the bus or in social situations, people have accused me of staring at them without me noticing. Needless to say i've never had a female friend, let alone a girlfriend so I haven't even had my first kiss yet.

During high school years i felt like i was too weird to hang out with the normal kids and too normal to hang out with the weird kids. I'm currently doing an honors engineering degree (4th year, top university, not a party school). So, girls are non-existant in my program (well, we have 2-out of 100ppl- not so feminine girls in the program so that's that). I spend all of my time either at school or in front of my computer playing video games. However, i dress sharply/fashionably and sometimes i've gone overboard which has resulted in some people thinking i'm gay. Also, i can't keep a conversation going for more than 2 mins, afterwards the subject automatically changes to video games and homework or alternatively, always end up in awkward silences.

I've gone to parties and girls have approached me to give me their numbers (i've never had the courage to actually approach a girl) or hit on me but it always goes the same way; me blushing and nervously saying ""thanks"" followed by an awkward silence and the girl(s) leaving me prolly thinking 'what a freak'. :( I also have random girls hitting on me on the street and stuff every now and then but i always freeze and don't know what to do or say so it all goes to shit fast.

Also, i'm kinda insecure about my body because i'm fuckin hairy and since my hair is dark and my skin is kinda pale it stands out way more than it should. What should i do about my body hair? Should i trim or get rid of them (wax/laser)? 

Let's see, what else... i have OCD and ADHD, i think (not clinically diagnosed). On the other hand, my sister who's a year younger than me is pretty much a facebook celebrity, has a ton of friends, has had shit load of boyfriends and is always out with her friends. I'm fuckin frustrated and depressed, not suicidal or anything though (yet). I closed my facebook account last year too (because no friends). What should i do?

I know you're all gonna be like 'oh dude, it's so easy, you just need to be social and talk to girls' it's not that simple and i'm often way outside of my comfort zone.

tl:dr; 22 y/o handsome loser nerd guy with no friends who is socially awkward and has zero social skills.

- I actually tried r/seduction's advice. i went clubbing solo, and after finding a cute girl, i approached her and said 'hi' and she smiled back and said 'hi' and then i choked so hard, i couldn't say anything. This took her by surprise and made her back off. I left the club soon after.

How did teenage you learn about personal safety?,"I've got an almost 18 year old daughter, and while she's a lovely girl- bright, friendly, compassionate, involved, etc., she seems to have almost zero sense of self-preservation. 

We've got a good relationship, all of her parents/stepparents have always been pretty open about our own experiences etc- the results of some of the stupid things we did in the past, that most of us were lucky in that a lot of our bad decisions didn't have too many real consequences, but some of them did, etc. 

She just seems to have that teenage 'nothing will really ever harm me' attitude, and I'm finding it increasingly concerning.  Not making plans in advance as to how she's going to get home late at night, not necessarily making the best choices in friends, taking unnecessary risks (walking alone across dark fields at night rather than spending an extra 5 minutes taking a lighted sidewalk), being very influenced by other people, and wanting to be popular, letting her phone battery run down, etc.  Fortunately she's very up on birth control, sexting etc., so at least we don't have to worry much about that. 

We do live in a fairly safe area- chances are nothing will happen to her walking across a field at night, and fortunately her interest in substances is restricted to pot (there's not much of a legal downside to that where we live).  And while it's always still tempting to think 'she's a kid, we'll just ground her every time she makes a stupid decision', she's almost 18, and we need to give her the opportunity to make good decisions on her own. 

I've been thinking about encouraging her to sign up for a self-defense for women class- not just for the actual self-defense, but because it might give her a better idea of how to pay attention to her surroundings, not put herself in bad situations, etc.  But aside from that, I'm pretty clueless right now. 

Was there anything that your parents/friends etc did that helped you learn to be conscious of safety when you were a teenager?  I think that I pretty much learned from experience, and I know that it's the best teacher, but some of those instances were lessons that I'd really rather she didn't have to go through. 

Any ideas or stories are appreciated.  I know that we can't protect her from everything (and we don't want to), and maybe I should just be trusting to luck.  I'd just like her to be a bit safer in her decisions. 

tl,dr:  Worried about my teenage daughter's decision making processes.  Maybe I'm just paranoid?

"Women of Reddit, I came across something that left me a little curious as to how you all feel about guys who don't really get out all that much???","Some of the women I've been with are a lot like me, while others like to get out and burn a bit more tire tread.... I should say **I'm a hardcore gamer**, a bit of an anime fan, and I like to get out there and shoot, ride and drive when I can. So most of the stuff I enjoy revolves around whoever has the most space. I've rented some power sports and go-carts here and there, but for the most part. Other than Airsoft, Paintball, RCs, Laser Tag, Riding or Walking Trails, Malls and Theaters. I usually just get out for a little food or consumerism, I'm love driving just for fun and enjoying a little fast food and some shopping. However, I'm a bit more of a loner unless I'm spending time with someone I've gamed with. Or met through a club event or a mutual friend.... I can be easy company in my element and generally I'm not all that cocky or competitive even when I'm doing something I'm really good at. I'm the kind of guy that likes to see people enjoy spending time with me. So if I see a chance to affect someone else's consumerism or there time alone. I generally try to get them to give a XBOX 360 or a Taurus Tracker 991 a chance at making there day.... I have a weakness for women that game and loungers in particular, so as far as getting out goes. Do you all enjoy just spending time with a guy out on the town, gaming online or just dropping by with a pizza, a movie and a smile.... I'm generally the type of guy that's more comfortable as a host rather than a house guest, but I also like to get out and drive with someone before they see my place. I can go out on the town or online with good eye contact and a good smile like it's nothing, usually I like to see someone's car first. Since I have a small place and have never really made it past the one bedroom apartments with my spending. I'd like to build a Z-Glass on a nice plot and forget about apartments as a whole, but I'm not quite there yet.... Anyways, I've always liked the rural settings much more than the urban ones. Though I enjoy a good meal and a little consumerism as much as anyone. So for a guy who likes to spend a lot of time gaming, who needs a bigger place and definitely likes to keep track of his time. How do you all feel about getting out??? If I have five hours of time with someone, I'll generally concentrate on meals, multiples, gaming, Hulu-NetFlix, Lounging, Driving, Riding, Trails, Shopping, Range Time, or just seeing what they're doing with their time when I'm not around. Don't get me wrong, I love spending time with women when we respond to each other. However, I usually go through my day the same regardless of whether I'm alone or with someone. **I guess in my mind we're all going through the day regardless, it's just a matter of how we divide our time and if we share it....** I'm currently single, but have always tried to include my SO in the best of my day and concentrate on making sure we enjoy our time together as much as possible.... So do most of you think that we should plan specific activities that we otherwise may not spend the time or money on, or that we should include you in our day as much as we can??? I do like keeping up with how we spend our time and money together. However, I like feeling I'm a part of something they've had in there life before I became a part of it and like we'll both take something away from our time together if we don't sync.... I've only had a few relationships in my life that have made the 3-6 month mark along with 2 that have lasted a few years. However, in almost every relationship I've had. We had a lot of fun together and we enjoyed our time, but eventually we were both looking for someone that we felt synced with our lives a bit more. Don't get me wrong, they were good women and good SOs. However, at the end of the day. We just didn't spend our time together and apart the same.... I even started doing an exercise in keeping up with our time together and apart I got from someone I had a lot of fun with who helped me start looking at how I wanted to spend my time. She got us to start looking at our time with each-other and alone in order to get a feel for how we incorporated into each-other's lives. We each kept a notepad by our beds and under our TV remotes. Then we'd use two letter initials to track time of anything we wanted to include our SO in. So meals were listed as ML and had the time we started followed by a dash and the time we finished. The same went for a few other initials, Gaming = GM, Hulu-Netflix = TV (Yeah I know that one seemed obvious....), Range Time = RA, Trail Time = TR, Drip Time = SX (Yes that includes our time with each-other and alone.), Sleep = SP (I've always been a night owl and this one just kind of shows up early if I sleep in and forgot to write when I woke up....). Then we'd rate the time itself on a scale from 1-10 to keep track of how we felt about our time, along with a smile if we were together and a little gold star if we happen to make a 10 in the course of our day A.K.A. ""SX 3:20 a.m. - 4:00 a.m (10)"" Anyways, we were always happy together. I love to wrap my arms around her, put my thumbs in her belt loops and pull her close. She liked playing with the hair on my arms and we were very aware of each-other if we were in the same room. We had good chemistry and she could make my dick drip without even trying to. Not to mention she could keep me up longer than most women I'd been with, she just made me grin because she was so casual about everything.... She could just slide her hand into her panties and work up a drip from the base of her velvet like it was nothing, she knew I was a Kasia fan and made a point out of it.... I never really knew when she wanted to go out, but she always enjoyed surprising me with a ""Have a little fun!!!"" attitude that would stiffen my dick. We both enjoyed gaming and movies, but she liked to give me little to no warning when she felt like doing something. Which made me grin at how impulsive she could be, but made it hard to read her. Anyways, we started looking at our time with each-other and alone and we started looking at how we divided our day up when we were with each-other and when we were alone.... Truth be told, we always tended to divide the time we had together between gaming, anime, sex, and meals. We never really did anything else while we were with each-other, of course that was almost as true of our time alone as well. That little moment in the day when you just want to lounge and curl up on the couch, your papason, recliner, or bed was the only real wild card in our time together. I had a relationship that lasted almost three and a half years and it is still the most satisfying relationship I've had with a woman to date!!! We were just always there for each-other, we weren't very structured and we didn't plan to far ahead. We just had crazy schedules and made the most of every day we could get a little overlap in our schedules. We spent a lot of time together just enjoying each-other, she kept up with me and I kept up with her and that felt like what we needed from each-other.... We still planned things where we could, but I've never had a job I got off before 10:00 p.m. other than a couple of freelances. I still want a call center job with someone like TSI to get my schedule a little more likable, I spent last year working 12 hour nights 4 days a week when I should have been taking credit card payments on 8 hour days.... Anyways, I've never really had a problem spending time with women. I like a good meal, some place they feel is theirs and that they're always welcome, a little curl up food and a little console time.... I guess it's obvious I typed all this at 5:07 in the morning huh??? Anyways, I just felt like tossing this one out there to see what pops up in the comments. **Truth be told, most of the women in my life know me well enough to know how I like to use my time.** So it's just a matter of how they get to know me and how I get to know them. I guess I wanted the opinion of a few women that don't know me at all. I know my type, and I'm happy with who I am. However, after reading a bit of Reddit a little earlier. I decided I didn't mind drawing this one out if I could get it all down in one post.... I know it's a little lengthy and it's way to late at night for me to be typing all this. However, as a single male I really just needed to toss this one out there somewhere and have it in my reddit profile as well. I don't know how many of you are familiar with them, but I decided to toss in a link to something that's helped me look at my time in the driver and passenger seat. I'm glad to say I've had the pleasure of adding a lot of gold stars to them over the years. So I don't mind the fact that they might seem like 30 seconds of the day you didn't have to spend. Once you have a month or two filled out in full, you'll enjoy keeping one under your driver's seat....

What do you think of Pamela Clark's article on ways for men to combat sexism?,"The author, a PhD student from the University of York, lays out on her blog [thirty-five ways in which men can help reduce our culture of sexism](http://pamelaclark.tumblr.com/post/87113711124/35-practical-tools-for-men-to-further-feminist).

Highlights include:

&gt;2. Do 50% (or more) of emotional support work in your intimate relationships and friendships. Recognize that women are disproportionately responsible for emotional labour and that being responsible for this takes away time and energy from things they find fulfilling. 

&gt;4. Give women space. Many women walk around—especially at night or while alone—feeling on edge and unsafe. Being in close physical proximity to an unknown man can exacerbate this feeling. Recognize that this is not an unreasonable fear for women to have, given how many of us have experienced harassment or abuse or been made to feel unsafe by men when we are in public spaces. Also recognize that it doesn’t matter if you are the kind of man who a woman has any actual reason to fear, because a woman on the street doesn’t have a way of knowing this about you or not. 

&gt;Examples: If a seat is available on public transit next to a man, take that seat rather than one next to a woman. If you are walking outside in the dark close to a woman walking alone, cross the street so that she doesn’t have to worry someone is following her. If a woman is standing alone on a subway platform, stand some distance away from her. 

&gt;5. … but insert yourself into spaces where you can use your maleness to interrupt sexism.***Examples: challenge men who make sexist comments and jokes. If you see a female friend in a bar/at a party/on the subway/wherever looking uncomfortable as a man is speaking to her, try to interject in a friendly way that offers her an opportunity for an “out” if she wants it. If you see a situation where a woman looks like she may be in distress while in the company of a man, stand nearby enough that you make yourself a physical presence, monitor the situation, and be in a position to call for help if needed.

&gt;6. When a woman tells you something is sexist, believe her.

&gt;7. Educate yourself about sexual consent and make sure there is clear, unambiguous communication of consent in all your sexual relationships.

&gt;8. Be responsible for contraception. If you are in a relationship where contraception is necessary, offer to use methods that do not have health risks for women (use of hormones, surgeries, etc.) and treat these as preferable options. If your partner prefers a particular method, let her be in charge of making that decision without questioning or complaining about it. Don’t whine about condom usage, and be responsible for buying them and having them available if that’s the method you’re using. 

&gt;Assume financial responsibility for any costs related to contraception. Women earn less than men, and also have to assume all the physical risk of pregnancy. Further, in instances where contraception involves any amount of physical risk, it is virtually always women who must assume this risk. As a gesture that redresses a minuscule amount of this disparity, heterosexual men should finance the whole cost of contraceptives. 

&gt;12. Pay attention to and challenge informal instances of gender role enforcement. For example, if you are at a family function or dinner party, pay attention to whether it is mostly/only women who are doing food preparation/cleaning/childcare while men are socializing and relaxing. If it is, change the dynamic and implore other men to do the same.

&gt;13. Be mindful of implicit and explicit gendered power differentials in your intimate/domestic relationships with women…whether a partner or family members or roommates. Work to recognize where inherent structural power differentials based on race, class, gender, sexual orientation, age (and so on). Where you benefit from these structural imbalances, educate yourself about your privilege and work on finding ways to create a more equitable balance of power. For example, if you are in a domestic partnership where you are the primary income earner, educate yourself about the gendered wage gap, and work on dividing labour and economic resources within your household in a way that increases the economic autonomy of your partner.

&gt;14. Make sure that honesty and respect guide your romantic and sexual relationships with women. The way you treat women with whom you are in a relationship is a mirror of your values about women in general. It doesn’t work to espouse feminist theory and then treat your partners like trash. Be upfront and open about your intentions, communicate openly so that women have the ability to make informed, autonomous decisions about what they want to do.

&gt;15. Don’t be an online bystander in the face of sexism. Challenge people who make, say, or post sexist things on the internet, especially on social media.

&gt;18. Don’t ogle or make comments about women. (i.e. Keep your tongue in your mouth and comments to yourself.) Even though women may be more prone to wearing more revealing outfits than men, don’t ogle them just because you want to and can. Though you may find someone attractive, there’s a line between noticing and being creepy/disrespectful. It makes the women being ogled feel uncomfortable, as well as any women who notice the ogling or are aware of the comments. 

&gt;22. Have integrity with your male friends. (i.e. Don’t be a “bro.”) When a male friend is doing something sexist (being a deadbeat dad, down-talking women, ogling women, secretly spending shared money, lying to their partner, etc) have integrity and say something to your friend. It’s not enough to think it’s wrong; let them know you think it’s wrong.

What do you think of the points there described? Do you agree with all of them? Do you think the list goes far enough?

"How frequently do you hang out with your male friends 1 on 1, and how frequently do you do ""date"" like activities with them?","PREFACE:  FUCK sorry in advance about the book, this has been gnawing at me obviously.  Also, I immediately hate that I said ""do you do 'date' like activities.  ""do you do"" what the fuck man... that sounds awful.  ""how frequently do you go on..."" would of sounded so much better.  Ok clearly I need to wrap this up.  Skip to the bottom if you're not in the mood for rambling.

I don't really feel like this is anything I should be self conscience about, but a friend recently brought some things to my attention, and I am curious how outside the normal my activities are.  

I've always had several close friends who are women, and while the majority of my friends are male, I've frequently had a few close, female friends who I always put a high value into their friendship.  Regularly in high school, I would stay over and watch movies or read books late, in very platonic settings.  In college I noticed a general trend towards privacy, if a girl wanted isolation with me she had romantic intentionswhile group settings were always platonic, so it was easier to gauge. But my life kind of fell apart around the age of 21, and I didn't really start picking it back up again till halfway through 24 and while I had romantic endevours, they were few and far between. And I guess that's the problem.  In the past couple of years, I've made some very positive and beneficial changes to my life, and now even the platonic situations are seeming more date-like to me as I've grown more and more successful with ""getting back on that horse.""

Lately, the tone seems to of changed among several women in my life.  Not only am I hanging out with them 1 on 1 more, the activities are definitely more ""date-y"".  It's everything from newly single neighborhood acquiescence reaching out to me for ""drinks after work"", to an old friend and I using the night her boyfriend was out of town (he knew everything by the way) to grab dinner, and go to a trendy hipster bar downtown.  There was the curator I went to school with, who I hadn't talked to in months who invited me over for wine, and 3 bottles later we were walking up to the neighborhood bar, then back to her place several drinks later.  There has been coffee, lunch, museums, art shows, gallery openings, and an obscene amount of cooking at my place and theirs.  The conversations are almost always intensely personal and honest, playful and flirty, sex almost always comes up, and on occasion the unavailable ones have played ""wingman"".  I'm not having trouble differentiating signals and things like that.  I know which girls may or may not be attracted to me, and while some of the situations definitely have some clear sexual tension, others clearly do not the general theme and activities all remain the same.  


But my friend addressed concern that they, and I were becoming reliant on these date like evenings.  That I'm proving a false companion of sort, and they are doing the same.  And I suppose he's not totally wrong.  I'm not one to turn down pretty, interesting women asking me to eat good food and drink booze with them, and I'm not going to feel guilty if I didn't get to sleep with them but now the flag has been raised, and I kind of got to know.  Is this just women interacting in their mid twenties?  Should I just shut up, and enjoy spending fun time with a parade of attractive, fun women, and stop over analyzing?  Every fiber of my being and instinct says ""just follow your gut, shut up and enjoy this"".  I mean it seems clear to me that the effort I put forth to improve myself is paying off, one way or the other... but I can't help but wonder, ""Should I look at these evenings more like dates, since the obvious dates can appear virtually the same as the platonic evenings out?

**TL;DR:  After working hard to improve several aspects of my life, I am now confronted with about a half dozen women from my life, acquiescence from the past, ex girlfriends, old long time friends, and long time crushes inviting me out for very date like activities, and while some are clearly not dates at all, I am for one worried that I *should* be reading into some of these, and two, am using these platonic ""dates"" as an emotional crutch instead of the real thing.""  At the same time, if interesting women keep wanting to do fun things with me and I'm not expected to pay, is that anything I should really be questioning anyways?  What are your intentions if you spend an evening alone with a guy, and how frequently does it happen?**

I guess I'm just kind of looking to hear how some other women spend 1 on 1 time with male friends in their life.  Thanks.",AskWomen,1,1363151903.0,11,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1a777i/how_frequently_do_you_hang_out_with_your_male/
How do you deal with public harassment?,"So last Tuesday, I was waiting for the light rail to go home at about 7:00pm. I had been at school (ASU downtown campus). All of a sudden, a man also waiting for the light rail tells me, ""damn ma'"" proceeding to look me up and down. He continued to say a lot of things such as you can be my new baby mama, you're so fucking fine, etc.

I was annoyed. I looked away, stood up tall, and refused to give him attention. When the light rail came, he followed me into the same cart I was in. He asked me to sit with him. I said no and chose to sit next to someone so he wouldn't have a seat near me. At this point, I was not listening to anything in my headphones (using it to avoid being talked to, but also needed to be aware). I could hear him speaking to another man in the light rail, talking about what he'd do to me. He kept calling out to me to turn around. Since I was choosing to ignore him, he sat the closest he could to me. He was trying to play footsies. I said no. Very loudly this time. He nudged the woman next to him saying, ""she doesn't want to play, but I'd play whatever game she wants all night."" The woman just rolled her eyes, looking at me with sympathy. I did not respond. He asked if I had a boyfriend. He threatened my ""boyfriend"" saying he would break him to take me from him. He kept asking me if I had somewhere to go, if I wanted to leave with him, etc. Then, he stood up and said, ""I'm nice unless you make yourself a stranger."" He touched my face and ran his fingers through my hair. I panicked at this point. I wanted to react, but I was frozen. By this time, the light rail was full of people. It made it harder to react since everyone was just looking at me with curiosity. They were waiting for me to react. I made eye contact with several people. They all just looked down in shame. He was still near me, saying things. But, I was frozen with fear, my ears ringing. The guy sitting next to me shook me out of it by saying, ""I'm getting off at this stop."" I decided to walk out with him even though my stop was only two stops over. I took my pepper spray out just in case he decided to follow me out.

I WAS MORITIFIED. I just got out and sobbed on the bench. I called my friend to pick me up. I don't know why, but this time the whole experience broke me in a new way. Usually, I'd defend myself, call for the light rail driver, call someone, etc. I think what made it so different was the fact that there was an audience watching, waiting for something. So ladies and gentlemen, how do you deal with harassment when it is so public and open?

tl;dr: I have dealt with harassment as a regular transit rider. But this time it was different. I was not the same person who would be proactive. I was weak. I was embarrassed by all the people on the light rail looking at me. How do you deal with harassment when there is a public audience?

"At work things, can anyone give some advice as to when to extend an invitation vs when to leave people alone?","I work in tech and I love learning so I spend a lot of time at conferences and events. The tragedy of how much it sucks to be a woman in that field is pretty well documented, and it really matters a lot to me, so advice from any woman in any field or even similar social situations would be really, really appreciated.

TL;DR: You're at a work thing where you don't know anybody and there aren't many other women. Do you just want to be left alone or do you wish one of the guys would reach out, even if you've had to deal with a lot of guys at this point?

LONG VERSION: Basically, I just want to know how to better avoid these two situations (or be told I am completely imagining things and given a new frame for what's happening):

1. At a lunch table with several other men, I notice the neighboring table is completely empty, except two women who are looking over at us. Remembering my first conference where I knew one other person and wished so bad that someone would come say hey, I decided to walk over and see if they wanted to join us. One of them says to the other, ""Oh GOD, one of them IS coming over here!"" and they both grab their things and leave before I even get to the table. I can only assume they were actually just keeping a lookout for yet another helping of harassment and there I was, barging into their lunch.

2. Sitting in a row of chairs, talking excitedly in jargon to another guy, I notice a woman next to us is looking at both of us and seems to be listening pretty closely. I can't tell if she wants to say something or just wants to listen, so I stop picking up the slack between me and the other guy's sentences to leave some room so at least she doesn't have to yell over us to join in. She motions as if she's about to speak a couple times, looks at her shoes, grabs her things, and leaves, missing the entire event she came for. Cut to me remembering all the times I tried to join a conversation, couldn't quite manage to, didn't get asked anything by anyone, and walked away feeling like I didn't belong.

I know that every person and situation is different, so maybe these kinds of things are just inevitable, but if there's anything to do differently, I'd love to know.",AskWomen,2,1443595625.0,7,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/3mxqes/at_work_things_can_anyone_give_some_advice_as_to/
I fear socializing with and disappointing women. How do I overcome this?,"Background: As a kid I lived life in my own little bubble because I was not observant at all, didn't like chatty socializing and was too obsessed with my interests. My dad started to abuse me, I developed a stutter and a lot of acne so my confidence got smashed to pieces. I then made the terrible mistake of going to an all boy's highschool and never made an effort to socialize with anyone because I was horribly addicted to video games and was extremely shy . I was so shy and socially pathetic that I would feel like I was freezing up and/or feel pressure in the back of my head when I walked past a pack of girls. I couldn't look a girl in the eyes to save my life because I was scared and I read too much crap on yahoo answers about how girls don't like being stared at. The few girls I talked to would instantly become quiet and avoid looking at me, so I assumed that girls weren't attracted to me at all.

So when I hit 19 I stumbled upon the idea of body language and social dominance. I went to my library and found a book on each and plowed through them. I had never noticed anything of the sort before because I was always lost in my own world. I didn't really understand what the book was talking about, but I was still curious, so I fixed up my body language and decided to go out into public to try to observe people and read body language. At first making eye contact with a complete stranger was scary as fuck and I felt uncomfortable looking at people for more than a second or two, but as I continued to do it I gained some confidence.

I started making connections between what I had read and what I was seeing with my eyes, and I made this startling discovery: when I stared at women they liked to stare back. At first I was confused (yahoo answers said nothing about this!), but over time I began noticing it more and more and more. I started to notice how girls would play with their hair, look tense when we made eye contact, peak at me out of the corner of their eyes, fix themselves up, instantly look down at the ground when I looked at them, shift themselves to give me a better look of whatever I happened to be staring at and a few brave ones will stare right into my eyes.

Unfortunately, I still don't have the balls to approach and talk to women. Now I feel more pressure on me because I feel like girls will expect me to be some sort of player. I've noticed that when I do talk to women they look at me expectantly and eagerly, and that freaks me the fuck out. Now that I""m more observant I've realized how much attention I get from people, both men and women, and I can't handle this. I've been accused by people of being arrogant, a sociopath, a snob, an asshole, a jerk, etc.. all because I'm too shy to talk to people. I know that the best way to overcome anxiety is to tackle the problem head on. I am trying to work up the courage to start speaking to strangers, but because I'm a piss poor conversationalist I never know what to say to people. What can I say to girls that will make me feel less uncomfortable around them (and them less uncomfortable around me)? Should I randomly compliment girls on the street? What kind of compliments are good ones? What conversation topics are appropriate for a conversation with a stranger (I know next to nothing about what people talk about)? I've missed out a LOT of opportunities due to fear and I don't want to miss them anymore.",AskWomen,0,1387950773.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1tnozo/i_fear_socializing_with_and_disappointing_women/
Hi r/women. 26/m regarding 25/f. Juicy texts I don't want to post but feel it would help clarify. Is this the case of a woman who doesn't know what she wants or am I just missing the bigger picture?,"I have people in my life to talk to about this but I would really love some objective perspective on the matter so I decided to post this. Earlier tonight I had a pretty emotional text conversation with my ex, mainly on my part.

I will try to catch you up on everything and then end with the last text conversation we had. Her and I have been broken up for 2 years. We dated for a year and a half, we loved each other deeply. The last few months of the relationship things just weren't working so I decided to end it (October '10). I said some very nasty things I'm not proud of, I broke her heart and broke us up for good. I regretted it and did what I could the following couple months to win her back. Meaning I did what I thought was right, I gave her time and space to make up her own mind. Every few weeks she would text me and we would meet up and have sex. And every time it was clear she did not want to be with me. Okay, cool. We don't talk for a while. 

Then, 7 months out of the relationship (May '11) she initiates contact again. We have sex. After this she yet again closes herself off to me. I e-mail her and tell her it's not fair she is using me while I'm trying to get over her and tell her to leave me alone. She says she doesn't want to be over me and she is just scared to get hurt again. Okay I say. She goes on vacation and comes back, e-mails me and says that her love for me is not enough, she does not want me back. Okay, moving on.

(January '12). She comes over and we hang out on my bed, catch up for a couple hours and she leaves. (April '12). She comes over and I give her a massage, we end up having sex. I'm used to it at this point so I let her go. (July '12). We end up becoming rock-climbing partners at the gym with some other friends and start to develop our friendship again, things are wonderful. I am enjoying the single-life and confident. (During the rock-climbing time it is announced she is moving out of state in October. I don't think even she knows why she is leaving). After a month she asks to hang out. Cool. She comes over, we have some drinks and have wild sex in the grass (best sex ever). The next few months (August-September) we continue to have the most passionate and incredible sex we've ever had. To the outsider it seems like we might be a couple again, sending cute pictures over text, dates, flirting, sleepovers, having amazing sex and talking for hours afterwards. All of it. 

It's now the end of September, she is having a going away party and I plan on going. The day before the party she comes over to borrow something. She is very cold and distant and won't accept my kiss. Okay, see ya tomorrow? She texts me a few hours later telling me not to come as she wants to avoid drama. I call her and we talk for an hour. She explains she doesn't want to feel inhibited at her going away party and that us acting like a couple is going to make it awkward for her. I understand and tell her that is her choice and I respect it. I then tell her to have a great time and to not contact me again. A few days later she is e-mailing me and texting me about how she is leaving in a week and wants to see me. I have her call me and we talk for an hour. She is crying and telling me how all she has been thinking about the last few days is me and how she wants to see me. She comes over that night and we have amazing sex. Laying in bed together afterwards, she promises to spend next Thursday night (Oct. 11, her last night) with me at my house.

A few days later (this past Saturday) and she has her final going away party at a bar that I attend. The bar closes. We go back to her empty house that we once lived in together and proceed to rip each other apart like animals. We wake up in the middle of the night and go at it again. She drops me off at my car in the morning, Sunday morning. I don't hear from her until Thursday (yesterday), the day she is supposed to come over. She texts me and that is where I will now show the last series of texts we have. Please bare in mind that at the end of our relationship I was incredibly sad that we weren't going to make it, and so I said many terrible things to her about why we weren't right for each other. I realized the mistakes I made and the last 2 years I have shown her only love and kindness. I felt the need to write all of this to give some perspective on why I may have said some of the things I did in the text. When we were texting I had been up for 24 hours and I was very emotional. I guess after 2 years of this shit I just let it all go. I felt like I had to say all of the shit I did and that she needed to hear it. Whether it resonated with her or not is another thing.

http://imgur.com/a/kDG3n

I was incredibly emotional and maybe I went off on her? I don't know. What do you think? I felt the need to write out our history to show how she has been going back and forth on me for 2 years now, and I kind of just finally snapped. I have been to therapists and have never been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. Although I do suffer from anxiety issues sometimes. I know, I've been setting myself up for failure every time for the last 2 years. But tell me what you think. Were my texts that bad? Was her reaction justified? Was she really using me? Have you been through anything like this before? What should I make out of this mess? I don't know how I expected this to end, I wasn't asking her to stay and be with me. I just know I didn't want it to end like this. I wanted us to have great sex and end things with a smile and a wonder on how our lives would turn out. But yet again she pulled away and left me alone wondering what the hell is going on. I'm just looking for any helpful perspective on the matter. Obviously we are cutting off all contact, and at the moment this is all I can really think about right now. This entire situation just feels so wrong to me and I'm hurting. If you made it this far and would like to leave a comment, please do, I'd really appreciate it.

when should i call this girl? (sorry semi long and detailed),"edit 2: problem solved. she texted me. thanks everyone.

tl;dr hung out with a girl for over 24 hours, had sex, when do i call her and what do i say?

a few weeks ago, i met a girl through a friend. we hung out a couple of times with the friend, then a couple of times alone. on friday/saturday, we hung out, did some drugs (the kind that makes two people want to talk to each other) and just talked for like 6 hours. we talked about everything about ourselves, like, everything. at one point she was like 'do you want to hook up at some point', and i just said 'yeah, sure, we could do that', but i didn't make a move. anyway, we started talking again then we drove around (sober by this point) for over 12 hours, non stop, without sleeping (we took like 8 caffeine pills) or eating (we weren't hungry, probably due to said caffeine pills). we visited where she grew up, the places that were important to her, etc, and talked a lot more. we also met up with some people a couple of times for like an hour or two. then we hung out at her house and the total tally for time spent together was well over 24 hours. before we got to her house, in the car, she asked me 'would you really sleep with me?' in like a weird tone. it wasn't commanding, it was kind of like a sad tone. it was weird. i said 'yeah, sure'. anyway, at the end we got to her house, hung out for a bit more, then we had sex, but it wasn't very good because

1) i am not very experienced and

2) i couldn't finish (she finished like 4 times tho). i told her it was because i was tired and hungry (which i was), but i am scared that she thinks it was because i thought there was something wrong with her.

3) we literally sat there for like 10 minutes before i could gather enough strength to make a move and start making out with her, and i could tell it might have bothered her, especially when combined with the me not finishing part. i told her right before i left that 'if you want to do this again, you *have* to tell me exactly what to do, because i don't know what you like', and she just smiled and said 'we'll figure something out'.

i *know* she liked me before the sex and i like her too. could the shitty sex have made her not like me? the entire thing started on friday morning and went onto saturday in the early afternoon. i texted her and asked her early last night about how she was feeling (from the tiredness and/or lack of food). she said she was fine, etc etc.

do i call her today? and what do i say? i ask because i have a habit of appearing too needy and fucking things up, and i really don't want to fuck this up. i also ask because we just hung out for a ridiculous amount of time and maybe she wants her space for a couple of days.



side question: before we had sex (her idea, actually, i didn't make a move), we were making out and i went for her nose instead of her mouth a couple of times; because of the awkward position we were in and also because i was super tired. we made out for like 20 more seconds and at this point she wanted to stop and was like ""i hope you don't treat me differently after this"" and then suggested we take things slow. i was like ""yeah, that sounds like a good idea"". so we just sat on the couch again for a few minutes and i offered her a back rub (wasn't expecting any sex at this point, i just wanted to make her feel better since it had been a long day). anyway, one thing led to another and we ended up not taking it slow and had sex.

my question is this: this girl has a *really dark* past where several people at different times took advantage of her and hurt her really badly. its much darker than a messy break up or anything like that. so as a result, she doesn't really trust men. what could she have meant by 'will you treat me differently'?

my first instinct is that she thinks i will just use her for sex or w/e. this is not even close to being my intention. how do i let her know this other than already telling her? (which i did)

but more importantly, what do i do to make sure she wants to keep me around?

edit: can i replace a call with a text? we have always only texted and never called.",AskWomen,9,1327857386.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/p1tkr/when_should_i_call_this_girl_sorry_semi_long_and/
"Where do I go from here? GF wants ""space"" due to personal problems she has not dealt with in the past.","OK, so here it goes. I am 22, she is 21. I met this girl a couple of years ago and I was taken aback by how pretty and outgoing she was. She had a long term boy friend at the time and we just used to see each other and say ""hi "" etc, but i always would think ah that girl is amazing.. so fast forward to March this year and we get talking again and it turns out she had broken up with her BF of 4.5 years about 25 days ago or something like that. The reason being she wanted time to be on her own and not feel the pressure of a relation ship and that one had just gotten too heavy for her and the guy had just forgotten to have fun any more. She had been drunk every day since then. I looked at her and I wanted to save her because I could see just how amazing she was and really just wanted to be in her company because she is was so infectiously happy and just really cool to hang out with. 

I was pretty sure she didn't want a relationship so we just hung out like mates for about a month without me expecting anything or anything at all. We kept telling each other we liked each other when we were drunk n stuff but would never say anything when we were sober because it was too much of a risk because we were such good friends at the time. Until in mid April I mustered up the courage to tell her I really liked her and she told me she reciprocates that ""like"". In mid may we began becoming officially together. I wasn't sure if this was the right decision for her at the time but she seemed very happy and said that i ""saved her"" from a really dark place in her life and that she really does put that down to me. We are at college and she practically moved into the house that I lived in with my mates. This was brilliant and I had the best few months of my life. She had suffered from depression  and an abusive relationship before me so I knew there could be unsolved emotional issues in the background but I choose to brush over it and keep going with this amazing relationship that we are now in. There were a few warning signs down the line like her not feeling happy with her appearance and not loving her self (even though she is stunning, and that's not just me saying that, she is totally drop dead gorgeous). But she maintained that she was happier than she has ever been so I carried on with it all because by this time i was totally in love with her.

Summer came and neither of us had anywhere to live so we decided to have a room together to save money and for company so we lived alone in a house to ourselves over the summer for like 2.5 months. This was amazing and just worked perfectly. It was perfect and we got on so well and just smoked weed and I did my dissertation over the summer and it was just brilliant. 

After summer she is now in her third year of uni and I have graduated and moved 130 miles away, (a 2 hour train ride). Everything was going brilliantly and she even said about two weeks ago that the distance has made us stronger, which is lovely. She is having a horrible time at uni at the moment because she feels all her friends have left and that her house mates are being bitches to her for no reason. She feels alone at uni even though she does have a circle of friends to be with. So what we said about a month ago is that in January, the first opportunity for me to move back to her area and for her to get out of her house contract, that we would move in together which would be brilliant. Like not for the whole future just like on a 6 month contract and we just see how it goes from there. She seemed totally and utterly on board with this. Our relationship was nothing like I or her (so she told me) had had before and it was just perfect so I didn't see any problems here. Apparently she is much more affectionate with me than she has been with other boys n stuff so that was a really nice thing for me to hold on to as I thought despite us maybe getting into this too fast she really cares for me and sees that this isn't just a stupid little time with me its the real deal. I loved that she would say I saved her from the worst time in her life. I felt so special and tried to make her feel special. Everything in our relationship was equal. We said (right up to like 5 days ago) how amazing it is that we love each other so much and so equally.

Now, like 3 days ago she says that she is having personal problems and she thinks that having a bf at the moment may not be the best course of action. I pressed her on this and convinced her (and she agreed) that in fact it would be better to have me around because I am the one who is there for her unconditionally and will be as long as she wants me. This is the FIRST time I have put my all into a relationship and it felt amazing.

So, yesterday she goes to see her bi-polar mum and depressed sister at her mums house. Her sister and mum are still REALLY good friends with my GF's ex, to the point two days ago he took a cat off the mums hands to look after it for a while. I really don't know what went on last night at her mums or what they were telling her but she is now convinced she has too many personal problems for her to be able to give me the love I deserve. She needs ""space"" to straighhten her head. Now, these problems are not even clear, she says that her sister said she jumped into us too soon and always need to feel that someone loves her and her mum said that my gf doesn't love herself so how can she love someone else. I'm not being funny but this is coming from two people that my gf has always labelled unstable and not particularly sane in any way. She moved out from her house when she was 14 to get away from her mum and now she is taking advice on her life when her mum doesn't even know me very well, apart from I did her massive gardening a few months ago, which was so nice of me. I thought my GF was happy, or at least that our relationship was something in her life that was stable. Which it is THE ONLY thing in my life that is stable at the moment because I have just finished uni and my life is all up in the air to be honest. I was so looking forward to the possibility of us living in the same place in January and stuff and now its all blown up in my face. She was not the only reason I wanted to go back to that town because that's the place I have spent the last 4 years and now call home! she was scared that me and her are the only reason that I am going back there and that puts pressure on her and us, apparently. I don't know why we cant just go with the flow. 

So, what should I do and how does this sound to you, Ladies? I need to know if you think its just her mum and sis that have gotten into her ear or its other things with her ex or I don't know. The thing is I don't want to ask her directly any of these questions as it will push her further away and make this even harder to get back. Do I just not contact her at all? Everything was so happy up until a few days ago so I really don't understand. I's sure the last thing she wants is to date other people, I just know that. Its something she has to deal with on her own but every part inside me just wants to help her. What do I do? I have just said to her I am going to give her space she needs but I am always here for her whenever she needs me. Don't know if I am being a mug though!

Thanks for reading all that (if you did) and your responses would be so much appreciated at this really difficult time. Its been therapeutic just to put it all down like this too. Any follow up questions I will be on my computer most of the day so just ask.

Please help me understand why this girl seemed both very interested and also not interested at all.,"Hi AskWomen,


Male here. I've had an interesting encounter with a woman recently. I don't know what to make of it, other than the typical guy excuse, ""I'll never understand women."" See below for TL;DR.


I met this girl on OKCupid. She wanted to meet up, so we did, and she was really cool so we continued texting each other and went on a few dates. We went downtown to drink, she introduced me to her friends, we chilled at my place and smoked, I took her out for dinner a few times, we saw a movie, watched the IT crowd together, etc. We shared a lot of things in common. I had only made slight physical contact -- holding hands, or hugs, etc -- I didn't feel the need to rush things. All in all things were really great. One afternoon I even surprised her with an impromptu nerf gun fight which I could tell she really really enjoyed.


**About a week later:**


She began flaking out. She wouldn't respond to texts as often or as promptly. We made a date to hang out one night and she cancels right before it's time to meet up because she wanted to do mushrooms with her friends. We try to plan another night but she flaked out on me again later that week. Overall, over the course of the second week, she either stood me up or cut our time short every meetup because of various excuses (mushrooms, need to help mom, etc), which may or may not have been legit.


She eventually stopped texting altogether and eventually, I decided she wasn't worth the effort anymore, so I stopped texting back. I thought this was the end of it, oh well.


**About 1.5 months later:**


I log on to OKCupid. She's online too and sends me a message. Something like, it scared her to death how much her friends said we were a perfect match for each other, etc. She explained that she was struggling with anxiety issues when we stopped talking to each other and that she was a wreck. She also explained that she was kind of seeing another guy when we stopped talking previously. Apparently it was an unhealthy relationship and she was sucked into it because he was depending on her for basic needs. She begged for another chance. 


At some point I expressed my displeasure for being a backup/""Plan B"" guy... she insisted that I wasn't. I wasn't convinced, but did not want to push it. So I continued with caution.


We text back and forth and I attempt to see if she is legit or not. She claims I made her happy; she seemed legit, or at least I thought. So, I say okay, let's give it another shot!


So, we hung out. Things were great and we both had a good time. We planned a follow-up date on Saturday. Saturday didn't happen; some family things again. Okay, more of the same. Well, how about Monday? Monday almost happened: we were texting right up until the point where she was supposed to come over. We were even talking about what we should do when we meet up. Literally we were talking 10 minutes before she was supposed to show up. 


Except she never appeared. Never got any response/text/message or anything from her since then. That was weeks ago. The only reason I know she's not dead is because I saw her in town the other day.


That's the story. All in all, it's very difficult for me to tell if she told me the truth at all or if some/all of it were straight up lies.


**TL;DR -- Met girl on OKCupid, we went on a number of dates, she began to flake out and we stopped talking. She finds me on OKCupid later and asks for another chance with a convincing argument, explains she was in an unhealthy relationship. I gave her a second chance and she flaked out again.**


I have no idea how to explain any of this other than she's insane. Can someone explain to me what was going on in her head? Did I do something wrong to scare her? Did she get tired of waiting for me to put some moves on her? Was I really her ""Plan B"" guy and she found another guy yet again to replace me with? Was she afraid of something? (I assume she wasn't afraid of commitment because she had just gotten out of a multi year relationship)


If it's me, what can I do to avoid having girls do this? I've never had a girl flake out on me so much.

Why do I get so depressed whenever I'm very physically attracted to a girl?,"I'm a socially normal 25m, with zero experience being sexual with girls (grew up in very sex-negative culture that I left a few years ago.) That being said, I've always had an easy time being friends with girls, and am generally considered an emotionally intelligent person. 

People like me as a person, I've just never put myself out there to girls as a sexual/romantic option.

For some reason, I find that whenever I develop a very strong physical attraction to a girl, it instantly triggers all of my insecurities - to the max. Even older insecurities I no longer think about, come roaring back.

While I do have depression and I am in therapy, I cannot understand why an intense physical attraction should be a trigger that instantly drops me into a completely despondent mood.

It's literally like emotional kryptonite for me, to the point where over the years I've almost come to regard intense physical attraction as a threat.

In general, I find that the first step in conquering something like this, is to understand what's going on beneath the surface. But in this case, I'm completely lost (and so are the few people I've discussed it with.)

It's like I can even try to talk to the girl, because that feeling alone is enough to instantly make me not want to talk to anyone.

I know the above paragraph describes depression, but I'm just hoping to decrypt what exactly a serious physical attraction triggers emotionally, that causes a depressed mood.

(Clarification: I say ""intense physical attraction"" to make it clear that I don't mean I walk around trying to avoid seeing pretty girls in the street. For these purposes I'm talking about the few that I've been REALLY attracted to over the years.)

TL;DR Feeling a strong physical attraction to a girl instantly makes me feel depressed, hopeless, and worthless. Why might that be?

Thanks Y'all!

"Super awkward hour with girl I like, how do I make meeting her less awkward?","For about a year now, I've been crushing on a girl in my dorms. I'm a finance guy who's generally very social and has no problems meeting new people, but I absolutely turn to mush everytime I see her. At first I was extremely awkward and would very obviously avoid her gaze (she noticed after a few times), then a few months into the year I noticed she did the same thing with me.

This wasn't a problem all last year because she's from a different floor, but while I was away during the Spring &amp; Summer, this girl became best friends with someone I regularly hang out with!

Recently (following my indoctrination into the dark arts of finance) I've finally gathered the courage to be less awkward and introduce myself, but when we ran into each other in the stairs today, she just smiled, blushed, and quickly ran the other direction, kinda like I was doing all last year.

Unfortunately, she visited my friend this evening and we were in the same room watching tv for a good 2 hours! Most awkward time of my life since I would catch her looking in my direction then turn away, and then do the same thing to her until she caught me.

I think she's interested in me but I'm not sure and I'm also not 100% on whether she has a bf already or not. Next time we run into each while alone should I be like ""wait! Let me introduce myself, I'm xxxxx, I've seen you hanging out with my friend yyyyyy all the time recently"" so its less super awkward?",AskWomen,7,1349320138.0,5,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/10wzab/super_awkward_hour_with_girl_i_like_how_do_i_make/
"Strategy, Timing, and Giving Up. (x-post from dating_advice)","I'm a 20 year old guy. I'm confident that I know exactly what will happen, but I'm still torn in cognitive dissonance that it's not what I want, and maybe I want someone to lie to me.

So we begin... &lt;details obfuscated for anonymity&gt;

March, 2012, I move ~100 miles away from home to pursue another career. Part of the rationale for this move is to start anew; to take full advantage of the opportunities of the new city. Well, that was the idea, anyway. I didn't change, but it didn't really bother me that much. Perhaps my quirks and neuroses knew what they were doing.

---

About the first week I was in town, I was exploring different foods (as I didn't have many options in the much smaller city of home) and came across a frozen yogurt shoppe. The girl behind the counter had to be the most disarmingly beautiful girl ever, because I suddenly became addicted to overpriced frozen yogurt. But I didn't mind. I did all sorts of rationalizing and making excuses, all in all completely absent of testes. I think the most tenacious pussying-out I tried was ""she's a symbol of the opportunity of the city. if you go and fuck this up, that'll just give you precedent of failure""... and so I continued getting frozen yogurt, never making a move.

---

Fast forward to June 29th, 2012. I am pulling into the parking lot, and another car pulls in right next to me. This is at a completely arbitrary time of day for a shift change, but it turns out it's &lt;girl&gt;. Apparently she wasn't supposed to work that day, and she had just been called in to cover for her manager. Now, I am fairly nihilistic, and try and avoid drawing meaning from coincidence, but this occasion was way to happenstantial to let go. I order my regular, smile, and just before walking off, I ask her ""Do you want to go flying?"" her face lights up, she presses the feed button on the register, and writes her name and number on receipt paper, and she says ""text me."" and I go, as not to hold up the line. Oh, and I am grinning ear to fucking ear on the way out that door.

---

We go the following Tuesday, and if there was any ambiguity if she was just in it for the flight before, that was gone when I saw the dress she wore. Holy shit that dress. We fly about 30 minutes to a neat airport with a restaurant on the field, and we have a couple ""hundred dollar hamburgers"" and the conversation just flows. It's all looking up. Then we fly back, and have a couple hours before she goes to work, so we decide to get some tea. This girl is smart, challenging, funny, and all other kinds of things that I convince myself of when I'm falling for a crush. Then somewhere in the conversation, I offhandedly said ""oh, like taking 3 months to ask a girl out?"" and she laughed, and said she was glad I did, because she was until about 3 weeks ago in a long relationship. But this is both a wonderful accident of timing, and an awful accident of timing, the awful part is to come on date #2.

---

Date #2, we go to a restaurant downtown that we had talked about the previous date, and it was neat, and the conversation has yet to stop flowing. Afterwards we go see a movie, and we're both determined to not let it end, so we go back to my apartment and watch yet another movie over a couple beers and conversation. Then the best move ever comes up - asking the ""what are you looking for"" question, the question that likes to burn children's toys, and throw salt at slugs. The gist of her answer was that she just got out of a 2 year relationship, and can't feel serious about anyone. She still wants to date, but doesn't want anything exclusive. And that exclusivity clause really put a bad taste in my mouth, and it pointed out an obviously imbalanced relationship as to the goals of the two parties. Yet, I am determined not to fuck up anything, so naturally I just stop talking, and start thinking. Or otherwise do the thing that always fucks things up.

---

I don't text her for 36 hours, and she gets worried, and says she still wants to get to know me, etc etc. and 48 hours later, I basically have come to the realization that it won't work, and yet I wanted to be as strategic as possible in explaining that, in the off chance it might. So begins date #3. Coffee. Initially, I pussy out, and wonder how after 48 hours, I couldn't think what to say. It ends up being just another date, we finish our coffee, completely ignoring the elephant in the room of the previous date, and then go walk around the centre, and wonder what to do. I decide on driving. I end up bringing her downtown, just to look at the city at night (we both like architecture) all the while playing Sinatra and I finally bring up the elephant, however tactfully.


Basically, everything I say she agrees with. She knows it's shitty for me that I fell into the accident of timing, but knows she is still hung up on the last relationship. She's convinced she'd be a horrible person if she started falling for someone else (after a guy basically said he didn't love her and dumped her after 2 years). I maintain my composure, I don't mention that I'm not giving up, and I don't push anything, no matter how much I'd like to. We get to her apartment, and I walk her to her door, and very few words are exchanged. We hug an impossibly long time, both knowing it's shitty how it's ending up, she says ""You're awesome."" I kiss her forehead, and drive home.

---

tl;dr, girl hung up on ex, but only 3 weeks out of 2 year relationship. Should I wait it out or give any more investment? Is there any way of approaching this that isn't self-sabotaging?

Basically, I want to give it time. How much, I don't know. But I don't want this to be so easily resigned to failure.",AskWomen,1,1341790589.0,1,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/w8qk6/strategy_timing_and_giving_up_xpost_from_dating/
Updating An Outdated Wardrobe. Part 2: Office wear,"I’d like to first thank everybody for the great feedback on the first part of this series, I’m glad so many of you found it helpful! One of the more requested categories was office wear, so that’s what I wanted to tackle next. 
 
 





The thing about office wear is that it changes more slowly than casual wear. That means you get more mileage out of your clothes, and you have to think about it less. However, “changes slowly” doesn’t mean “never”. Of course, you may be entirely uninterested in that and in upgrading your work look. And **that’s 100% fine**. 
 
 





*However.*
 
 
 




IF you would like to remain current, there are tweaks that you can eventually make in your work wardrobe. 
 
 






I want to specifically point out that this is not meant to focus on looking TRENDY, but on looking CURRENT. These are not cutting edge trends, these are not trends worn by 18 year-olds. They’re styles that are more updated than, say, 2010 - 2016 office wear. 
 
 






Please keep in mind that updating your work wardrobe DOES NOT mean:
 
 
 




●      That you need to throw out all your existing wardrobe
 





 
●      That you need to dress in a way that doesn’t feel like “you” 
 
 






●      That you’re trying to dress “like a teenager” or in any way non “age-appropriate”
 
 






●      That you’re a slave to trends
 
 






●      That your wardrobe will now be “unflattering”
 
 





 
Updating your wardrobe DOES mean: 
 
 





 
●      Assessing your current wardrobe with a critical eye and identifying what works and what doesn’t
 







 
●      Taking a look at more current/modern fashion styles and picking out some elements that would work for your tastes/wardrobe
 
 







●      Setting some goals for what your ideal wardrobe/look/message is
 
 








●      TRYING THINGS ON before forming an opinion on new styles
 








 
●      Planning your wardrobe for the next few years and making strategic changes/purchases
 
 
 






*Another thing I want to insist on is that everybody’s workplace is different.* That means different expectations, levels of formality, dress codes, and rules. *Every idea/example will not suit EVERY workplace and every dress code.* 
 
 




 
I’m not mandating anything here. I’m simply reporting on what’s current and what isn’t, *for those who are interested*. I tried to include outfits and ideas that run the gamut of formality. It’s up to you to assess which ones would fit your needs and which are inappropriate. 
 
 





 
You also do not need to make ALL the changes. I’m including examples of different clothes and elements, how they may have changed over the years, and what is their more current version, compared to what was fashionable a few years ago. But it’s up to you to swap the elements that make sense for you and that fit in your wardrobe. No one’s telling you to change everything from head to toe, unless that’s what you want! 
 




 
 
###The Basics
 
 





 
Most people aren’t looking to reinvent the wheel when it comes to workwear, and that’s fair. The workplace is not (usually) a fashion show - unless you work IN fashion or an otherwise creative field. But that doesn’t mean you can’t look modern and current, if that’s what you want. Even if you’re keeping your outfits basic, there is still room to update, upgrade, and style an outfit that’s as simple and “timeless” as a white shirt and black pants. 
 
 




 
##The blazer
 
 





Some examples:

[blazer 8](https://www.girlsharestips.com/wp-content/uploads/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-31.jpeg)
 
 






 
The jackets we’re currently seeing are longer and roomier than jackets of yesteryear, more menswear-inspired OR a very snatched-waist Balmain-inspired look that’s come in over the past few years, with an emphasis on power shoulders and a contrast with a smaller waist. The straight cut jacket is long (sometimes even covering the butt), double-breasted, and can be oversized. The new crop of jackets are shorter, go in at the waist, and are either single button or have a single row of buttons, a la [Dior Bar Jacket](https://www.dior.com/couture/var/dior/storage/images/folder-media/folder-productpage/folder-crossselllook/folder-femme/folder-winter-22/block-f_22_4_look_096/35141174-1-eng-GB/f_22_4_look_096_1440_1200.jpg). 
 
 
 



If you feel like your office is too casual for a blazer, you can opt for a more casual material than the classic black suiting. Tweed is always a good choice, you can go for wool, and for a jacket that is patterned, rather than solid-colored. That’s going to look less formal. Suit vests have also been very fashionable in recent years, and they can be a good alternative if a blazer feels too stuffy or is Too Much for your office. 
 
 



 
##The button down shirt
 
 





Some examples:
 







[shirt 1](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/plus-size-fashion-button-down-1660773267.jpg?crop=0.770xw:0.867xh;0.141xw,0.133xh&amp;resize=980:*)
 
 
 





 
[shirt 2](https://40plusstyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kimbajeans.jpg) 
 
 
 




 
[shirt 3](https://www.uptowngirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/winter-work-outfits-24.jpg) 
 
 
 





 
Despite what “timeless classics” bloggers would have you believe, a (white) shirt is not, in fact, timeless. Nothing is. Allow me to explain. Yes, the concept of wearing a white shirt will never be “dated” because that’s not how fashion works. An entire category of clothes rarely goes out of style. However, **the specific characteristics** of a shirt can, and do become outdated. Things like the shape and size of the collar, the cuffs, the buttons, and the length and the shape itself are all very specific to a certain era.
 
 





 
The “classic” white shirt from 2003 is tight, short (because it was worn untucked), oftentimes with an oversized and pointy collar and cuffs. The “classic” white shirt from 2010 is longer and straighter, with a tunic collar that does not button up, occasionally meant to be worn with a wide belt on top to emphasize the waist. It was meant to be worn untucked, on top of tight pants. The sleeves had tabs that buttoned up to keep your sleeves rolled up around elbow-level. There might have been some square pockets that were placed too high. We also saw more long, empire-waist tunic-type shirts in this 2008-2012-ish period. 
 
 
 





The “classic” white shirt from 2023 is a generous cut that’s long enough to tuck into your pants or skirt, but not long enough to cover your butt. It should end around your hip. That means that you can also wear it untucked, over your pants, without it looking frumpy. 
 
 




 
Seeing as the fashion is moving towards tighter and shorter shirts (no, we’re not talking about crop tops) to go with the wider bottoms, you can also expect to find more body-conforming shirts in the near future. Shirts with a marked waist, princess seams, and generally a variety of tops that go in at the waist. The blazers and jackets with tapered waists are already present, so we can expect the shirts to not lag too far behind.
 
 





 
##The pants
 
 





 
Some examples:

###Slacks
 
 
 


 
The current standard cut for a pair of office slacks (including suits) is a high-waisted straight leg or wide leg pair of pants, usually full length. Cropped, ankle length pants are still encountered, but usually in culotte, or wide styles, less so skinny pants. The high-waisted cigarette pants (or carrot leg, or peg leg) are still out there, but the style is meant to be a little roomier in the butt and thighs; the office is not the place for your tightest pair of pants. These often come in a paperbag waist style, which is very flattering on a lot of body types, as well as comfortable - because the belt is adjustable. 
 
 




 
The rise is getting lower, however, as low rise is coming back into fashion, meaning that you should be able to find midrise and lowrise pants in wide cuts if that’s what you’ve been waiting for. That won’t change much for footwear, but it might trigger some changes in terms of tops, depending on what styles you’re wearing now. If you were used to tucking shirts into high waisted pants, a low waist doesn’t allow for that. So, you probably need to rethink and re-strategize towards a top that sits untucked, at the top of the hips, for the most traditionally harmonious proportions. 
 
 





 
Nowadays, a lot of pants have elasticated back waistbands, or even entirely elasticated waists or drawstring waists. [Office joggers exist](https://outfittrends.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/plus-size-interview-outfits-5.jpg.webp) for the new iteration of the more casual and relaxed post-pandemic office. Rises and cuts are encountered in generous varieties. There is no reason for a standard pair of slacks to be uncomfortable. And god, are there office pants of all varieties right now. 
 
 




 
(A quick note on fit: 
 




 
Even without stretch, a pair of pants that fits well should not be uncomfortable, should not pinch you anywhere, dig into your stomach, or feel tight or constricting. Size up, go for a straight or wide leg if a tight leg is constricting, and try a higher or lower rise if your waistband cuts into your stomach. Do not purchase the smallest size you can fit into. Bosquerella did [an excellent write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/s6ynwh/psa_being_told_to_size_up_is_the_advice_you_asked) on the matter you can revisit if you need the reminder. Everyone deserves pants that fit. 
 
 





 
Whatever type of rise you’re searching for, I recommend measuring your ideal rise from between the legs and up to where you want it to hit, whether that’s 11 inches, 14 inches, 8 inches, etc. Take a tape measure shopping if you have to. Measure the pants you’re interested in or learn to eyeball it, the name of the style doesn’t necessarily tell you anything about how they’re going to fit ON YOU, because all our bodies are different. Depending on the length of your torso, you may need a different rise than the model does. Shop for your body.)
 
 
 




###Stretchy pants
 
 




 
Leggings have never exactly been business casual, and regardless of their debatable status, they’re just not current anymore. Leggings just don’t read as polished when paired with business casual clothes, and they require a high level of effort in every other aspect of the outfit in order to elevate them and make them presentable and current in the workplace. 
 
 




 
The exception to this is an athleisure look in a workplace that is very casual and allows sportswear. Think tech or non client-facing roles in other industries. And speaking of leggings, let’s address their ugly stepsister, ponte pants. Despite their misleading name, they do not look like pants, let’s be honest. 
 
 




 
If stretchy pants are your go-to, the much better - and more modern - option is a pair of straight leg athletic fabric pants. Straight leg or flared, usually with a front seam or crease and even equipped with pockets, this version at least attempts to mimic the look of regular pants. 
 




 
 
##The heels
 
 





 
Some examples:
 
 



 
[heels 1](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c3/c0/72/c3c072c0a985db820ba609b7af676034.jpg)

While there are still plenty of industries and offices where heels are common or even explicitly required, they are becoming less and less expected. The current heel has changed both in height and in shape/thickness. Thicker block heels are more current than stilettos. A patent, square mid heel will serve you well. 
 
 



 
Heeled mary-janes are currently the IT shoe, and there are variations on the strappy, mid heel style at many different price points. Usually patent - but also leather, for easier maintenance, or satin, for the high-maintenance dressers - mary janes are comfortable, versatile, inoffensive, and come in many different colors at the moment. Sole thickness differs, as does shape, but a lot of them follow the rounded square shape that is currently popular in footwear. 
 
 




 
Boots haven’t gone anywhere, either. A block heel ankle or knee high boot can be perfectly appropriate for the office, as long as the heel isn’t too high and they’re not a very irreverent design. 
 
 




 
##The flats
 
 
 
 
Some examples:

There seems to be a disconnect in mentality where a lot of people think that “trendy” shoes can’t be comfortable. Dressing for comfort doesn’t mean you need to wear basic shoes. I’m about to say something that I know is upsetting for like, 70% of this sub, but it needs to be said: Rothys are not a modern shoe. 
 






 
More supportive shoes are in style, thankfully, and a loafer is much more current and better for your feet. The Gucci-type loafer and the trend it sparked is a little more basic and doesn’t stand out as much. It’s less of a statement, and more of a supporting character in an outfit. The platform loafers, like the Prada ones, for example, are trendier, but they’re also very comfortable. The thicker sole is very supportive and provides good shock absorption if you’re going to be walking miles in them. 
 
 




 
If you want to retain the ballet flat style, the modern ballet flat has a flatter, square shape and dance-inspired detailing that is meant to mimic actual ballet shoes. Pointed toe shoes are also coming back in fashion, and the most modern iteration of a pointed ballet flat is a slingback. 
 
 
 



Mary-janes also have a strong presence among flat shoe styles. One, two, or multi-strap, in patent, leather or canvas, for summer, mary-janes are the perfect feminine, but sophisticated shoe that can work with a variety of outfits, including pants and skirts of varying lengths. 
 
 




 
##The bag
 
 




 
Some examples:

Bags for the office can be tricky, because they oftentimes have to carry your whole life, but still remain professional-looking. That’s one of the reasons why huge, unstructured bags like the LV Neverfull and the Longchamp Le Pliage were popular for so long - they’re not cute, but they’re practical. 
 
 



 
Thankfully, something even better came along, and that is the bizcas backpack. Carrying a laptop, your lunch, your water bottle, your umbrella, and your gym shoes on your shoulder is a one-way ticket to a messed up posture, health problems, and an expensive chiropractor bill. Choose comfort, practicality, *and* fashion by opting for a modern backpack, instead of a gaping nylon bag with thin straps that dig into your shoulder. 
 
 



 
Leather is the most elevated choice, but leather backpacks can be heavy, depending on size and construction, so take your time assessing the best material for your needs. 
 
 



 
###Fun/casual/out of the box alternatives
 
 
 



##The colorful suit
 
 
 



Some examples:

[suit7]( https://fashioncanons.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Powersuits-For-Women-Best-Street-Style-Looks-To-Copy-1.jpg)
 
 
 



If you’re in a more formal industry that still expects a suit, the best thing you can do for your work wardrobe is to get yourself a colorful one. Suiting is huge right now - and has been for a few years - so there is no shortage of office-appropriate options that won’t bore you to death. Valentino pink is particularly prevalent as it’s one of the hot colors of the season, but Bottega green is also in, and you can find an entire range of power colors to give you that extra pop. 
 
 



 
If you’d rather play it more subdued, there are plenty of pastel options to choose from. Softer, more feminine, but still 100% professional, pastel suits allow you to cheer up your office wardrobe, particularly for the spring and summer seasons, as these tend to come in summer-weight fabrics. 
 
 




 
##The interesting top
 
 
 
Some examples:
 
 


 
[top1](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/d4/8e/d2d48eb8a0571f48a6879de5934d25f7.jpg)

 [top7](https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/black-jeans-outfit-blouse-and-block-heels.png?fit=728%2C921)
 
 
 


 
If you want a look that’s more elevated, but still retains the same basic neutral top + neutral bottoms formula, all you have to do is tweak the style of the shirt. You can still keep it white, or another neutral shade, but make sure there’s an interesting design to it. You can play with shape - oversized, billowy, straight, cropped, voluminous, etc. - it’s up to you and your preferences, design details - voluminous sleeves, interesting neckline details, contrasting trims or buttons, etc., material - silk, linen, satin (very current), which also impact drape and silhouette. 
 
 
 



Again, color is not something you need to shy away from in the workplace, especially if you’re going to pair it with neutrals. There is nothing about colorful clothes that is inherently unprofessional (unless you work at a funeral home). If a top is professional in white, it’s also professional in blue, or magenta. A “spicy” shirt can be the visual interest you need in an otherwise drab work outfit. 
 
 


 
##The midi skirt
 
 
 


Some examples:
 






[midi 1](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/62d1ac8b005fcb0457a8d85f/1673157327421-NKD71A84YLVYYHVJ3TZQ/maxi+skirts+-+%40SYLVIEMUS_.jpg?format=2500w)

[midi 7](https://www.girlsharestips.com/wp-content/uploads/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-44.jpeg) 
 
 






 
[midi 8](https://blog.petitedressing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/loafers-17-473x1024.jpg)
 
 





 
You may have noticed that in recent years, THE skirt/dress length has been the midi. Reaching around mid calf, the midi oftentimes has a medium to long leg slit. BUT there are simpler and less sexy versions for the office. The shape is straight or conical, rather than the A-line accordion pleated midis we saw around 2016. However, it’s not the tight pencil skirt shape of the 2010s, either. Think more body-skimming, rather than a spandex-y bodycon. 
 
 
 




In addition to being very current, the midi is very office-friendly because of the conservative length. It goes great with heels, but it also looks good with flats, especially the more modern chunky shoes. A midi skirt can be worn with a classic button-up shirt, or a thin turtleneck, a chunky knit, a t-shirt for more casual offices, and it can even be taken out for drinks or shopping after work or on the weekend. A very versatile piece that can work hard in your wardrobe for the next few years. 
 
 




 
The danger with a long skirt is to not veer into frumpy, church-y territory. If you’re going for a midi look, I recommend styling it in a very intentional way, with some very modern accessories. A midi skirt with a thin-soled ballet shoe from 2012 and a long, thin cardigan might look frumpy and awkward, but a midi with a chunky loafer and an oversized blazer looks like an intentional outfit. Same with boots - forego the heeled low cut ankle boot and instead, opt for a chunky knee-high boot. It can also look very chic with a longer, oversized, chunky knit.
 
 




 
Another way to make sure it’s not reading frumpy is to pick a modern fabric. Leather skirts are very in right now, as are satin slip-style skirts. In the right cut and in a high-quality material, they can be professional, while still remaining stylish. 
 
 

 
##The sneakers
 
 



 
Some examples:

The main aspect people appreciate about wearing sneakers is that they are comfortable. But if you’re looking to update your work wardrobe, you should know that Allbirds-style shoes are an outdated style. A black pair *could* be somewhat neutral, especially combined with a [chic, modern all-black outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/20/30/1a/20301a413d025332047845afbb6871c8.jpg). 
 
 
 



But there are equally comfortable sneakers out there that are sleeker, more modern, and more professional. You don’t have to wear the chunky dad sneakers your 15 year-old is wearing, but a sleek, white sneaker with a clean shape that’s not overly stylized or embellished is a perfectly respectable choice that will bring your work style closer to 2023. No synthetic mesh, please.
 
 



 
If you feel like white is too stark and stands out too much as an athletic shoe, black is always a safe choice. If you can afford to be really daring in a casual office, you can even try a pair of platform converse. They’re not just more current, but they’re also much more comfortable, because the sole isn’t as thin and lacking in support as the classic version. Plus you get a tiny bit of height, even without heels. 
 
 
 



##The jeans
 
 


 
Some examples:
 





[jeans1](https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/248544/cute-outfits-with-black-jeans-248544-1603664436620-image.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&amp;quality=70)

Jeans in the workplace were once a hotly debated matter and it may still depend entirely on your specific office. But in a post-covid world, where so many are reluctant to even go back to the office at all, dress codes have relaxed and jeans are more prevalent than ever before. And why shouldn’t they be? A good rule of thumb for wearing jeans in the office is to stick to a pair that is non-distressed, and solid-colored. No rips, stone washing, or fading and whiskering. Black, dark blue, or mid-blue are all okay colors. Maybe even white, in the summer. 
 
 



 
For an updated outfit, the new styles of jeans are all very workplace-friendly, because they don’t cling to the body so tightly like skinny jeans did, so they’re not emphasizing anything that an old white man might be offended by or overly taken by. There is no reason why a pair of straight leg or wide leg jeans shouldn’t pair great with a shirt, a sweater, a blazer, and a pair of loafers for a casual office environment. I’d stick to jeans that are actually hemmed, and not distressed, but at the same time, your legs are mostly under a desk, so only you know what you can get away with!
 
 



 
#Modernize your office fit
 
 



 
Finally, let’s look at some typical, average office fits you’d see 10 years ago, and how we can retain the same basic, reliable structure, but with updated pieces. Allow me to remind you that we don’t need to throw out the clothes in the outdated examples and replace them all with clothes from the updated ones! You can get more mileage out of your clothes if you mix and match with some more modern pieces. 
 
 



 
##sweater + black pants





 
[do this](https://www.uptowngirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/winter-work-outfits-22.jpg)
 
 







[instead of this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e0/52/52/e05252880ffbc9de47d0d72033d07b7c.jpg)
 




 
 
The cut matters so much in an outfit, as you can see in these examples. We’re still retaining the exact same formula, but we’re simply updating the pieces. While it’s still a big, oversized gray sweater, the style becomes chunkier, with balloon sleeves. 
 
 




The black pants are flared instead of skinny, which is a more modern cut. The boots aren’t almond-toe, but pointed, and they match the other light-colored accessories. 
 






## long top/sweater + leggings + flats

 




[do this](http://ladyfashioniser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/white-sweater-black-leggings-and-white-sneakers.jpg)

If your office is casual enough, you may still be able to get away with wearing leggings. Rather than pairing them with ballet flats, opt for a pair of sleek sneakers. You can still keep the white shirt and the knit format, but update to a chunky knit sweater, instead of the thin cardigan. Accessorizing with a big scarf indoors is unnecessary, unless it’s cold. If you want to keep the accent scarf, opt for a thinner silk square scarf, instead. 
 







##top + cardigan + slacks




 
[do this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/39/7f/1e397fbcc564ef0395c88b3c3df5bf10.jpg)

This is a great example of how you can still wear your long cardigans in a much more modern fit. If you look at the first example, that short, tight cardigan on top of a tight top makes it look like the cardigan doesn’t fit her properly; it’s straining on her body. That’s never a flattering fit. The looser cardigan with a more generous cut in the second example allows for a more comfortable fit. 
 




 
The belt is present in both examples for waist emphasis, but tucking the top inside the pants rather than letting it hang on top is an instant update you can easily make to your everyday fit. If you prefer an untucked top, that’s perfectly fine, but choose a looser fit and not a tight jersey top. 
 
 




Accessories also irrevocably date an outfit. The chunky statement jewelry can easily be swapped for simpler pieces that subtly enhance and highlight, rather than being the focus of your overall fit. 
 
 
 



##sweater + jeans

If you’re gonna do a knit with jeans for work, you can easily update the look. Swap the skinnies for a pair of straight leg jeans. The riding boots or ankle boots can be changed into combat boots or a chunky pair of oxfords, and the knit can be swapped for a chunkier, either cropped or oversized sweater. Or you can opt for an oversized knit vest. It’s worn over a t-shirt in this example, but it works beautifully over a long-sleeved button-up shirt, or even over a tight turtleneck. 
 




 
##dark suit + heels








[do this](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/plus-size-fashion-power-suit-1660766422.jpg?crop=0.927xw:0.952xh;0.0578xw,0.0314xh&amp;resize=980:*)

The basic suit has changed shape, with slim ankle pants being less current than straight, long pants with a crease. The blazer is longer, less fitted, and more oversized, and the heels have more of a square toe (or a more elongated point), rather than the short pointed heel in the first example.

As you can see, sometimes it’s just a matter of styling. The two examples aren’t that different, just slightly updated. The jeans are no longer skinny, but straight-cut. It’s still a style that conforms to your shape, just more modern and less constricting. The shirt is tucked into the jeans, instead of a long, untucked shirt. We still keep flat shoes, but we choose something with a platform. 
 
 





Again, opting for minimal jewelry over the chunky, statement necklaces will instantly make your otufit feel fresher and more modern.

Advice on how to wear what I want but cope with sexual harrassment,"Hi!

I know that women are sexually harassed regardless of what they wear, but I assume that we'll get more attention when we wear revealing clothing. I often find myself covering up to decrease this attention, but my taste in fashion includes more revealing (or just eye-catching!) clothing. 

Do I just have to suck it up and feel unsafe? Is this just the necessary trade-off (wearing what I want vs unwanted attention), given what the world is like?

How do you guys cope with this?

Edit: thanks everyone for sharing your tips, personal stories and hugs. I struggle with this feeling because I don't know when this ""fact-of-life"" ""need"" to protect myself transitions into self-victim-blaming (and normalises victim-blaming in general). You've given me a lot to think about. 


In terms of ""coping"", it's helping me to re-think ""vulnerability"" - 1) looking vulnerable/unlikely to fight back [which to everybody who has been put in a spot, I'm so sorry, and it's so difficult]; 2) feeling vulnerable and shrinking in on myself for it. I found the comments encouraging, to take up space (and wear what I want) with confidence, to not let creeps take that away from me, and even deter them with still more confidence. All the practical tips for when I still feel scared and unsafe were also very much appreciated &lt;3 thank you everyone ",femalefashionadvice,870,1615553031.0,213,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/m3gs33/advice_on_how_to_wear_what_i_want_but_cope_with/
A Guide to Making Your Fast Fashion Clothes Last Longer,"I often see people say here that their fast fashion clothes “fall apart” and I appreciate this is a bit of a hyperbolic statement but fast fashion these days *does* feel like a race to the bottom in terms of quality. Equally, buying more sustainable clothing is not an option for everyone. But one thing we can all do is try to buy better quality within our budget and take care of our clothes to ensure they last longer. Here are my top tips on how.

**1. Look at Labels/Descriptions**

The materials used to make your clothes matter a lot but the binary of natural fibres as good and synthetic fibres as bad is not accurate. Material science is a highly advanced field and both natural and man-made textiles come in high and low quality (yes, even polyester). Cheap fast fashion does tend to be on the lower end of the quality scale but there’s a reason why some of our fast fashion items may seemingly randomly last forever and why others don’t.

- Cheap cotton is still pretty decent. E.g. for basic tops or trousers if there is a price difference between two seemingly identical items of clothing, check the fabric. Sometimes it’s 50% cotton 50% polyester vs 100% cotton. Spend a bit more, get a bit more.

- Most knitwear eventually pills, but to avoid this and the inevitable use of a fabric shaver for a bit longer, avoid knitwear with too many textiles. The more textiles, the more likely the knit is going to pill and the same goes for looser knits. Most people will champion wool and cotton but in terms of synthetic fibres for those who are allergic (like me!), acrylic is a warm and cosy choice.

- For denim, look for a high cotton percentage. Obviously, this depends on how you like your jeans to feel (more cotton = stiffer) and the style (a skinny leg jeans need to have a bit of elastane/spandex) but heavyweight cotton jeans are less likely to wear away at points of friction (e.g. the thighs) and also less likely to lose their shape over time. I go for 100% cotton in looser styles and 95% cotton/5% elastane in skinny jeans. Cheaper brands will use a lighter weight of cotton compared to say, Levis, but they still tend to be sturdier. Equally don’t pay £100 for a pair of lightweight jeans, even if they’re 100% cotton. 

- Faux leather sucks. It’s plastic and it starts peeling within a few years, even when sitting unused in your wardrobe. I avoid it, especially in shoes and bags where real leather is affordable. Vegans, we’ll chat when [mycelium](https://www.mylo-unleather.com/) and [piñatex](https://www.ananas-anam.com/) are more common, affordable and have proven their longevity. Until then, leather is often a better quality option.
- Satin is not a fabric, it’s a weave and it could be made of silk, nylon or polyester so don’t be fooled.
- You’ll often find better basics in the men’s section. Same price point, higher quality materials. 
-  Sometimes a mixture of materials is a technical decision rather than a financial one so assess what the material is doing in the clothing. Elastane adds a bit of stretch, polyester can reduce wrinkles or increase durability, nylon can be moisture wicking. 

**2. Learn How to Spot Quality in Clothing**

A higher price doesn’t *always* denote better quality, but the following factors affect cost of production, the price of the garment and improve the quality overall. 

- Lining: Coats, trousers, skirts will have an inner lining which adds warmth, thickness, comfort and increases durability. 

- Generous sizing: Whilst inconsistent sizing is a problem, cheaper clothing will just about hit the number if not slightly under on the brand's size chart. Generous sizing will be more accurate and have a bit “give” which can account for bloating, natural weight fluctuations, movement etc. which means less strain on the clothing. 


- Zips and buttons: In a similar vein, zips and buttons on dresses, skirts and trousers allow you to pull clothing over your body without straining fabric and still retaining a figure-hugging shape. Buttons last longer than zips and  zips come in a range of qualities too so I always reject items with a stiff zip.

- Seams: I’m not an expert on this but a simple test is to pull the fabric at the seams and see if it has room to stretch or whether it looks like it’s in danger of tearing. (More notes on seams in the resources below.)

- Tailoring: The more tailored an item is, the more likely it will keep its shape for longer.

*Bonus* Pattern matching: Different pieces of fabric stitched together will match at the seams and look better. 

**3. Don’t Buy Specialist Clothing from Non-Specialist Stores**

Unless you absolutely know that a fast fashion item is good quality, avoid buying something like a ski jacket or a pair of hiking boots from just anywhere. Often the reason why a store specialises in that item is because they are experts and there is technology behind it. As mentioned, materials matter and you want your technical fabrics - be the UV protecting, waterproofing, insulating - to be made by experts. In this case function is more important, fashion is a secondary factor. 

I personally consider shoes of any kind to be specialist (cobblers and tailors were historically separate professions for a reason). A few years ago, after my flat feet started complaining when I wore most of my shoes, I switched to exclusively buying from shoe brands. So far they have been more comfortable and longer lasting. It takes a lot of skill to make a good quality shoe and I just don’t think clothing brands make good quality shoes. Also if a good quality shoe wears away, you should be able to take it to a cobbler to be resoled (not had to use that option just yet so not sure how viable it is with high street shoes but definitely something to keep in mind). 

Side note: I appreciate that a lot of functional brands such as outdoorsy brands have not traditionally considered the fashion side and some still look like they haven’t changed their designs for 20 years ago BUT I think that’s changed a lot in recent years and you can get some gorgeous stuff at Passenger, Finisterre or The North Face that both looks good and is highly functional. 

**4. Laundry**

Gentle laundry is probably the top thing you can do for your clothes. Unless you are sweating through them or they are socks/underwear, you do not need to wash every item every time you wear it. The further something is away from direct contact with your skin, the less often it needs a wash. Spot clean if possible first (the corner of a towel works well for this).

*Washing* 

- Wash at a cooler temperature. Apart from bedding, towels and face masks that need a higher temperature to kill germs, I wash everything at 30°C.

- Avoid fabric softener. It’s not needed for most clothing but for activewear in particular it reduces the moisture wicking quality, traps sweat and reduces elasticity. 

- Wash your clothing inside out. Pilling happens as a result of friction when clothes rub against each other. This happens far more intensely in the washing machine than when you’re wearing them. Printed t-shirts will also retain their pattern longer and clothing with details like zips, beads or gems will stay secure and are less likely to damage other clothing if they are inside out.

- Do up zips, hook bras together and separate items into netted wash bags if they need a little bit of babying. Ideally wash bras by hand or on a delicate cycle to protect the cups and underwire.

*Drying*

There are valid reasons to not dry your clothes outside but if your excuse is laziness here’s your reminder that **heat from the dryer shortens the shelf life of your clothing**. I live in the UK and I will happily dry laundry outside between May to Octoberish and then I shift to using a dryer in the cooler seasons. I’ve also definitely taken advantage of working remotely and hanging clothes out to dry during the work day so sometimes it's just about stealing time here and there to accommodate it.

- You can partially dry things outside and then put them in the dryer to get the last bit of moisture out. Or vice versa, depending on the weather and what you’re drying.

- Some clothing, such as cotton and jersey fabrics, tend to dry more slowly so if you are using a tumble dryer, pull out lightweight clothing halfway so that they aren’t being blasted with heat for no reason.

- If you are in the position of buying a dryer, opt for one with settings for delicates and activewear.

Side note: I wouldn’t recommend drying all of your laundry on the radiator. All of that moisture has to go somewhere and if that place is your walls and ceiling, it is a guaranteed recipe for mould. 

*I don’t separate my darks/lights/coloured...*

because I mostly own synthetic clothing where the colour doesn’t bleed. Imagine my shock and disappointment when a secondhand cotton skirt bled a rust shade onto my white bamboo gym top. Lesson learnt - I now do a test run for new clothes and secondhand clothes and anything that bleeds will get a dedicated 15 minute cycle when it needs washing. 

**5. Learn How to Sew a Teensy Bit**

I’m not going to preach about the wonders of sewing your own clothes. I am not interested in sewing. I recently tried to hem a secondhand dress, with the guidance of my mother who is a very skilled seamstress. I spent over an hour hand stitching the hemline but somehow ruined the shape, despite my mum saying that my handiwork looked fine. So the problem is that sewing is hard and I am not invested enough in learning. ^(I will probably learn how to hem because most clothing is too long for me and I refuse to pay someone for a job I know I *could* do with a bit of practice but the point is sewing is a skill and I have no desire to *master* it.)

HOWEVER, I come from a culture where tailoring was the norm up until very recently and most women know how to sew in some capacity so I have picked up on some useful things. Basically my advice is to learn how to make tiny alterations that can keep clothing functional for a bit longer or slightly improve upon something that has been cheaply made, such as:

- Securing loose buttons (especially useful for coats)
- Sewing snap buttons for gapey tops 
- Stitching up loose seams when they come undone
- Securing straps on a top if you’re in danger of flashing a stranger the next time you wear it
- Removing extras you don’t like from clothing with a stitch picker

Those are my big points on how to get the best out of your fast fashion though there are lots of little things you can do to take care of your clothes too. 

I really didn’t expect it to be this long but I'm trying to be a more ""conscious consumer"" - part of that is moving away from fast fashion but it’s difficult to do so completely. So when I do shop fast fashion, I’m trying to raise my standards for what I'm willing to buy from fast fashion and only go for items that are good enough quality to last a long time. 

I would also love to hear your tips and tricks!",femalefashionadvice,1164,1633206251.0,134,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/q02p1i/a_guide_to_making_your_fast_fashion_clothes_last/
Translating inspiration styleboards into a wearable wardrobe (with examples!),"Have you meticulously curated a Pinterest board or folder of photos for fashion inspiration and absolutely love the aesthetic you’ve found, but realized that all the outfits in the photos are too impractical to directly translate to your lifestyle?

You can still definitely infuse your own wardrobe (or start a new one, if you're in the process of doing an overhaul) with some fantasy style. Just because you need or want a smaller capsule wardrobe doesn't mean it needs to be full of white button-down shirts, black trousers, nude pumps, and LBDs.

Focusing on building a wardrobe rather than constructing as many individual outfits to be as evocative of the theme as humanly possible makes the style more wearable and easier to integrate with other sorts of pieces that are either more minimal and casual or of another style.

**There is a FAQ after the examples discussing a few things like “Do I need to have just one style? Do I need to define my style(s) to Fashion properly?”**

Edited again on 7/16 to clean up formatting and add *more* detail, after a detour of the post getting removed by automod because I accidentally added a url-shortened youtube link.

[**Now with downloadable pdf version of this guide**](https://mgetsdressed.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/translating-inspiration-styleboards.pdf) (sans the examples because then it would be 50 pages with all the photos, but I've updated to include some small written examples at each section)! Thanks u/katie-didnot for suggesting I make one.

## What this is

This is a pretty long post, but I hope that this guide can give anyone who feels lost trying to pull the aesthetic of a more fantastical inspiration boards into their actual outfits without feeling like they’re wearing a half-assed cosplay a detailed framework and concrete examples to help make that happen.

I enjoy making inspo boards and sometimes come up with wardrobes for them. Sometimes it’s an entirely virtual wardrobe, sometimes I like to see what I can come up with just from my existing closet, and sometimes I want to change up my style a little and will get more things. 

These are the sorts of things that I look for when analyzing any inspiration board. I find that for so many things in life, starting from a checklist can help a lot. Since this is a creative endeavor, there are a lot of ways you could do this. If you have another method that works for you, I’d love to hear about it in the comments! I personally love organization, structure, lists, that sort of thing, so this way has worked well for me.

## What this is not

Magic – If you want to look like you're wearing super dramatic period pieces or extravagant costumes in your inspiration board, but don't actually want to wear literally these things, you are not going to look *exactly* like the original board. We're still going to end up with an interpretation, not a direct ""how to cop this exact look"" outfit.

A shopping guide – Items shown were selected purely on visual merits and from coming from stores that provided clear stock photos for illustration purposes.

A complete wardrobe overhaul guide – See the [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2sz2lo/so_you_want_to_do_a_wardrobe_overhaul/) from the sidebar for great advice on how to go about that. I also recommend reading “The Curated Closet” by Anuschka Rees which is what the sidebar guide is based on. A lot of this post has roots in the methods from the book, though I’ve emphasized what I’ve personally found helpful as well as added content including some outfit styling tips. The book goes over a lot more areas related to wardrobe overhauls, such as learning how to shop mindfully and evaluate clothing fit, as well as going into more detail on things that are just briefly discussed here, such as closet composition.


Examples attempt to be somewhat comprehensive in broad categories of clothing but are not aiming for 100% coverage of clothing for every activity life could throw at you.

A gold standard for inspiration albums. I do include some boards because that’s the whole starting point, but the focus on this was more on the process of distilling a style based on looking at elements like fabrics and cuts and not how to make a great album featuring a diversity of bodies and designers. I was also lazy and didn’t copy all the individual images into an imgur album (just a shot of the whole board), but if you’re doing a standalone inspiration post you should do that because then people can see the images more easily.

# Distill the elements of your inspiration board

When taking notes for this section, avoid vague terms like “ethereal” or “1970s”. Go for concrete details like “low square necklines” or “monochrome tie-dye”. You can use the more vague terms to group details together, but most of the list should be things that you can literally search for online, or something that is an instantly identifiable property of an item.

**What are the recurring visual elements in the style board?**

Since you’re going through all this because most of the items in the board aren’t directly wearable for your lifestyle, you want to start off looking at more basic properties of the style. For example, it’s easier to look for something if you’re looking for a “light colored longline wool(-blend) coat with faux fur collar/cuffs” than “something that feels like a snow queen would wear it”.

* **Colors and prints** Get really descriptive with your notes on prints. For example, if there are polka dots, are they large, bold, randomly placed polka dots or tiny evenly-spaced polka dots? Is animal print a realistic pattern or stylized? Does the print have crisp edges or is more painterly? Are the colors high contrast or muted?
  * In addition to noting specific colors, I like to identify types of colors that works for the style because when shopping it is usually impractical to literally only buy five exact shades. For example, cool-toned pastels and deep jewel tones, saturated earth tones, or warm greys.
* **Fabrics** Note general fabric properties. Structured and crisp suiting fabrics? Earthy fabrics like heavy linen? Diaphanous fabrics like mesh and lace? Are there a lot of technical/performance fabrics (i.e. athletic fabrics). Pay attention to fabric weight, drape, and texture, even for things like t-shirts.
* **Silhouettes** What common outfit silhouettes are there? Which parts of the body are emphasized and de-emphasized? Are shapes more organic and slouchy, or tailored? You can get a bit more clothing specific here where it makes sense, as some descriptors are only applicable to a particular category of clothing, e.g. “wide leg pants”, so we can start getting more specific here). For example, “sharply emphasized shoulders in a structured silhouette that defines the waist”, “a soft columnar silhouette with long dresses that lightly skim the body with lots of fabric”, “structured cropped outerwear over a very fitted top and slouchy pants”, or “sack silhouette that leaves no idea of the body shape, but with fitted sleeves / sleeveless”.
* **Motifs** A catch-all for any other notable (but specific!) details. For example, “celestial objects” (if they appear a lot in jewelry and as clothing embellishments but aren’t exactly a print) or “visible mending”.
* **Styling choices** How is the clothing worn can also make or break a look.  Are tops always tucked in? Are they tucked in neatly or in a looser partial way? Are shoes always worn with visible socks? Are pants cuffed or shirtsleeves rolled up? Are tops buttoned up all the way? Is there always a ton of layers? Is jewelry bold or minimal? Is hair worn down and loose or up? Does hair have volume or is it kept sleek/short? Is there visible makeup? Is it graphic or soft and blended?


**What makes this distinct from other similar styles?**

What subset of the visual elements should we focus on to keep the style intent more obvious? Thinking about what not to include can be as helpful for keeping the style distinct as what to include.

For example, if you have a “queen of the night” board and decided you will be wearing all black, how will you keep your look distinct from other commonly black monochrome aesthetics? You could note to avoid denim and t-shirts (especially together), and to try and avoid completely unembellished outfits (the queen of the night is not a ninja).


# Note requirements of your lifestyle

What constraints does your lifestyle put on your wardrobe? E.g. Is this capsule for work, weekends, or both? Are you in a business casual office? Have an active job? Bike commute? What’s your tolerance for fussing with clothes? Is dry cleaning okay? Do you go clubbing? Attend operas? How often? Do you have fluffy pets that shed a lot? Young children?

Note hard requirements to put on clothes based on these lifestyle. E.g. no fabrics that collect or show lint easily, machine-washable and dryable fabrics only, only items that have enough stretch you can bend over and do squats easily, nothing that requires special undergarments to look nice, long sleeves must be able to be pushed up, no skirts or pants that drag on the ground, nothing that requires a very specific kind of tuck to look nice.

You can keep some distinction for special occasion clothes, but be realistic. If you are at work or at home or doing something active outdoors 97% of the time, if you want to minimize the number of items which collect dust in your closet, aim to buy everything to fit into your criteria.

Write that all down.

# Identify specific items make the biggest impact

What specific pieces do you think would make the biggest impact for this style? These will likely be more distinct types of clothing (e.g. flare pants, military style jackets, wide-brimmed hats) that appear in multiple images, or a detail (e.g. plaid fabric, embroidery) that appears in multiple pieces.

Be specific but not so specific you have no hope for finding the item at all lest you get it custom made. Think along the lines of detail in “plaid wide-leg or loose tapered trousers” or “heavy boots with a lot of hardware”. Write down anything you think could work, and note whether there’s a range of colors you’d like to find it in, or are set on finding it in a specific color.

For any pieces that do not work with the list of lifestyle requirements, try and think of a similar item that still has the same feeling. For example, if your board has lots of people wearing pointed toe stilettos but you don’t wear heels, you could add leather pointed toe flats or boots. Sometimes there might not be any obvious toned-down version for an item, but that’s okay. There are so many dimensions of style to work with that you can always incorporate something else.

# How do you actually find stuff once you have a list?

This is a bit of an art, and it’s a combination of knowing the pure elements you want and finding some brands that tend to make that style.

It generally helps to know more fashion vocab, so you can search particular shops or on Etsy or ebay. The easiest way to do this is to image search for “types of { collars / sleeves / skirts / etc }” and take a look at some infographics.

If you have no idea what shop to start with, use the shopping tab on Google or search in shopping aggregators like Lyst.

If you find one brand that fits the style, find their Instagram and see if they follow similar brands. If they have a hashtag on instagram, see what other brand hashtags people who wear that brand use.

Err towards looking at a lot of stuff and bookmarking it and filtering things down later. If the style you're chasing is incredibly specific, it's unlikely you'll find a brand that caters to it exactly.

# Building a well-rounded wardrobe

As you’re looking for new pieces, consider the role each item plays in an outfit. Is it more of a statement or a base piece? Is it a shirt/bottom/outerwear/shoe/etc? Is that a niche that is filled in the items you have already?

Try and fill out categories of clothing evenly. If you have 10 items of new style that you’re mixing with 50 items of your old style but 7 of the new items are blouses in the same color family, that’s probably not going to make as much of an impact as if you had a few bottoms, a piece of outerwear, a pair of shoes, and some accessories mixed in.

## Notes on color palettes

In my opinion, keeping a limited color palette is the easiest way to get a cohesive feel in a wardrobe that may otherwise be eclectic.
A limited color palette doesn’t necessarily mean a neutral palette. You can pick neons and cool neutrals, colors that remind you of a tropical vacation…. you name it. Just keep constraints on some dimensions of the color.

Color can also be used to create a sense of variety in a smaller wardrobe. To create more depth in the capsule using color, you can include at least one color each that’s dark, medium, and light value.

Check that the color variety isn’t just in one category of your wardrobe. Try and have as much of your palette as possible in each category (i.e. if all your tops are colorful but all the bottoms are dark, that still won’t feel like much variety).

# Integrating a new style into your existing wardrobe

It’s fine to keep items for this new style as a separate mini capsule within your wardrobe. But if you want to be able to integrate them without looking too eclectic, I recommend sitting down with the list of key items you've identified and a shortlist of your most-worn clothing (a simple paper list or spreadsheet with one column per clothing category works great) and considering how things could work together in different combinations. e.g. if you are deciding what type or color of top you could get, think about whether it would work with at least 3/5 of your most-worn bottoms.

Depending on your wardrobe, the style you’re trying to add, and what level of eclecticness you’re cool with, tasteful integration with your current wardrobe may not be feasible and you may want to just keep the new style as a small capsule within the rest of your wardrobe.

Definitely don't buy a new wardrobe in a month! Start with getting a few items (I'm talking like, 2-3 things) and see how you feel from there. Again, if you’re doing a wardrobe overhaul, the [guide in the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2sz2lo/so_you_want_to_do_a_wardrobe_overhaul/) outlines some advice for that excellently.

# Finding a balance of wearability and drama in outfits

We’re essentially aiming to half-ass the style on the original board. But to look intentional, half-ass it evenly in the whole outfit. Keep the parts of the outfit at similar levels of formality. Items don’t have to be exactly the same level of extra, but it will look more cohesive if they are all about one level of formality of each other.

Zoe Hong’s video “How to Design From Runway to Real Life” (being extra careful not to offend the AutoMod again with a shortened link – her channel is youtube.com/zoehongteaches) goes over a lot of elements that can make things more or less wearable. It’s written with an audience of design students in mind rather than consumers, but the concepts are all solid. Formality of clothes in women’s fashion is much less clear cut  than in men’s fashion, but generally fabric will determine a lot of it. i.e. Just because it’s a dress doesn’t mean it’s formal. A stretchy knit cotton sundress is less formal than a cotton poplin sundress, and a dress in the same cut with tiers of eyelet lace would be  more festive.

If you’re going to err towards more disparate levels of extra in the items used in one outfit, I find that grounding the look (literally) with shoes that have visual interest often makes the whole thing look more intentional. Doesn’t mean you have to wear bedazzled heels, but the shoes should have visual weight and contribute to the style of the outfit. For example, flat leather oxfords, pointed toe boots, or chunky strap flatform sandals all have more visual interest than your standard pair of low-profile black sneakers or flip flops but are still being wearable relative to a lot of the shoes you find in Pinterest outfits.

Another method that you can try is rather than starting with a plain outfit and swapping in or adding more fanciful pieces, you can initially go all out with the look and then remove (or swap out for a more low-key version) a few accessories or base items until you feel comfortable.

I included three examples. The first is more on the extreme side in terms of starting point and endpoint because I feel that makes for a clearer example. It’s a complete but small wardrobe and the outfits are shown as polyvore style collages because I obviously am not going to actually buy a wardrobe's worth of stuff for a reddit post.

The latter two are like the FFA Inspo Album Starter Pack (I mean that as a term of endearment) and use items that are a subset of my actual wardrobe. The first one is more of an “I don’t want to go through this whole damn list exactly step by step, but I can more or less get the idea” example. I generally follow this process when doing my own wardrobe remixes now that I've done it so much I don't need a literal checklist, but in the last example I really go all out picking apart the board details just to show the kinds of things you can notice and decide whether to incorporate into your own look.

I chose more popular ones because since these are the sorts of styles I’ve seen a lot of inspo posts for over the past few years, I’m familiar with, and I could actually put some outfits together with using mostly stuff I had already. If you’ve got your own board and a list of some items you decided to get based on it, I’d love to see them!

## Example 1: Victorian garden party, but make it athleisure
When your inner self is eating muffins and sipping tea with the characters of The Importance of Being Earnest but you work from home and are very active and have no tolerance for any sort of clothing that doesn't have high stretch.

This one just uses stock photos but I did collage the stock photos into outfits to give a better idea of how they could go together.

* Inspiration: [Imgur screnshot](https://imgur.com/PKtatXV) and [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/ter4gr4m/tea-time-style/)
* Items and Outfits: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/kdNONqw) More detailed explanation of how I chose different types of items are in the imgur album. You can find the items and outfits as subsections on the Pinterest board linked above.

### Recurring Elements
* **Colors:** creams, whites, beige, pastel floral colors, quite a lot of green and lighter blue – think of a lovely spring day
* **Fabrics:** Sheer layers, lace, airy fabrics, silk
* **Silhouettes:** Nipped in waists, full skirts, high necklines or sharp v or square necklines, graceful gathers and drape, voluminous sleeves
* **Styling Choices:** Hats! Hats were an integral part of outfits back in the turn of the century. Skirts and sleeves are poofy, but there aren’t really layers.

### Distinguish from other styles

There’s going to be a fair amount of overlap with any sort of aggressively soft and feminine style, but to give the wardrobe a bit more focus, we can decide on some things we are not going to include in order to reduce elements that may skew it in other directions.

* **Ballet style:** Soft frothy pastels and floral motifs and athletic cuts are also strongly associated with ballet. In order to steer a bit away from this, let’s avoid anything with mesh or sequins.
* **Lingerie-inspired style:** Corsetry and yards of lace are both elements that conjure images of fluffy Edwardian blouses and parasols. However, if we are going with more skintight athletic wear items, then these can easily move into a lingerie aesthetic, so let’s avoid lace-up and lace elements.

### Misc notes

I actually started out focusing on creams, pinks, and purples, but realized it would read a bit too “gendered childrens clothing line”, so I decided to add the blues and greens.

Another thing I did here to keep things simpler was limiting the floral prints to accessories and bottoms, but avoiding tops. I felt that floral tops was the more pedestrian choice (I’m being DRAMATIC and CREATIVE here), so I limited it to pants and accessories. I think this also makes it easier to mix-and-match because you rarely have to worry about clashing prints if they’re all in pants.

### Specific things to look for

In this example since I decided to stick to athleisure it was simple enough to just search for floral prints and colors within the palette. For accessories I wanted to include some more direct references, so I looked into straw and canvas bags, a wide-brimmed hat, and a porcelain tea set inspired water bottle.

## Example 2: Your basic witch
This is basically the recurring summer goth/witch themed inspo that pops up periodically.

Here tbh I just got lazy but figured it would be good to have one shorter and less “Are you crazy?? Who’s gonna go through all these steps and detail????” example anyway.

Looking at the inspo board on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/ter4gr4m/warm-weather-witch/) (or a screenshot of it on [imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aUJpxvO.png)), we can see it’s a pretty traditional dramatic romantic goth sort of style with all black, with a bent towards a medieval historical style rather than more punk-y goth.

Say we’re starting with a casual wardrobe that’s mostly black already, but is pretty plain so no one would take a look and be like “YES this definitely has low-key witchy vibes.”

If the spring/summer basics are basic black denim shorts, jeans, and a jersey maxi skirt, plain sandals, and boots and I don’t really want to go full out queen-of-the-night-wears-valentino because I like stretch skirts and denim, then the place to try and incorporate the style would be in tops and accessories.

If I have the 3 bottoms mentioned above that I want to incorporate and get 2 more fun and themed (i.e. more elaborate or sheer fabrics, or silhouettes with dramatic poofy sleeves and/or severe medieval dress style square necklines) tops that go with all of them, then that’s 6 outfits and if you’re only wearing these on weekends that’s already a great set to work with, especially if you add options for accessories. You can have a lot of fun with a particular style even if you don’t have a giant collection of items for it.

The most obvious accessories to add would be a black wide-brimmed hat and a purse that has more elaborate details on it. Silver-toned boho jewelry would also work, as well as some more fashion-y sunglasses (e.g. circle style or cat-eye style instead of aviator).

I also shamelessly love witchy styles. This year I decided I think the more maximalist version is a lot more fun than the minimal sack-dress woodsy style, so I got 2 tops that were more on theme. I wanted to get more feeling of variety so I got a long sleeved off the shoulder blouson sleeve top and a square-neck sleeveless crop top. I think a lace-up corset closure would be more on-theme than a zipper, but I’ve tried lace-up styles before and I personally don’t like wearing them. I like how this top is reminiscent of stays (as in the corset-like things) but the zipper keeps it from being too ren faire anyway. (I already had a black sun hat).

[**Et voila, a few outfits.**](https://imgur.com/a/IZbLSrM). More obviously inspired by the board than a black ribbed tank top and the same bottoms, but also wearable in a casual setting.

## Example 3: 1920s-1940s adventurer style

You know those posts. The perennial Indiana Jones / Lara Croft inspired posts.

**Inspiration, items and outfits:** [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/pAS81H2) (more details on how I chose items and put together outfits in the album). [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/ter4gr4m/old-school-banana-republic-style/) (just inspo).

### Recurring Elements

TLDR: earth-toned vintage military-inspired style with a relaxed but practical feel.

* **Earth tones:** Obviously. Olive, khaki, beige/cream, browns of various shades. Some black, but it’s not a dominant neutral. Think National Park Service.
* **Sturdy natural fabrics:** All over the catalogs you see them bragging about how the properties of the cotton, linen, wool, and leather items of various kinds will aid you on your adventure. Not the sort of technical materials you’d get from modern workwear and activewear brands. (For the record, I don’t hate synthetics on principle. They just don’t make sense here.) There are still soft fabrics, but nothing diaphonous or delicate.
* **Comfortable silhouettes:** a bit loose to accommodate movement because spandex wasn’t really a thing in clothes back in our era of inspiration, but not so loose that things will catch on vegetation or machinery. I didn’t want to comb through all the scans to dig it up, but the copy from one of the catalogs advertising a skirt said something to the effect of “loose enough to take long brisk strides in without catching between the legs”.
* **Military details:** A lot of this style is closely related to the military (i.e. pilots) or is just so utilitarian in bent that military surplus makes sense. 
* **Vintage styling:** The catalogs cite inspiration anywhere from the Victorian era through the 1980s (they did actually sell t-shirts in addition to stuff like that embedded scans), but from what I can tell focuses on the elements of 20s through 40s. With an 80s bent, for example they have so many sweater dresses and shirt dresses with wide belts over them. So this means mostly structured and tailored items and more classic style shoes like lace-up boots and oxfords.

### Specific items and styling details that could work

* **Boots:** A lot of the modern inspo photos feature Doc Martens boots, which also work with the military inspiration. Shoes are generally comfortable and on the sturdy side, and are lace-up. Chelsea boots would work too.
* **Loose trousers:** Specifically jodhpurs, but we can assume that we’re not going to be walking around casually in those any time soon, but trousers that are relaxed around the thighs then tapered down can have a similar vibe. Wide-leg 40s trousers also appear. There aren’t really any leggings or skinny pants. Jeans were a thing in the 40s and definitely appear in a lot of working women historical photos, but I think going hard enough on the vintage pieces to pull a look more old-timey with jeans will usually end up looking like a costume or a 50s pinup style so I’d just avoid it.
* **Midi skirts:** Not mini skirts (might as well wear shorts) or maxi skirts which would be a trip hazard. Crisp styles rather than breezy or boho styles.
* **Belts.** Belted everything! Very 80s with the dresses.
* **Aviator-inspired bomber jackets, shearling jackets**: Optional: those leather flight caps and goggles :P 
* **Safari/field jackets**
* **Linen/cotton button-down shirts, beige/white or olive.** This + khaki or olive bottoms are core pieces. Henley shirts or plain tops can also work, more of an off-duty sort of vibe.
* **Hats:** structured hats like panama hats, in straw or wool. Probably wanna avoid anything that looks like a literal pith helmet.
* **Bandana/scarf** for hair or around the neck.
* **Heritage/Fisherman sweaters**
* **Jumpsuits and safari/utility dresses**
* **Vintage aviator style watches**
* **Leather/canvas backpacks and messenger bags**

For modern looks, a balance between vintage-inspired and modern. If pants are more modern (e.g. plain trousers vs pleated trousers), pair with a more old-timey top. If the top and bottom could be just any old outfit, add a hat + statement vintage shoes.



### Distinguish from other styles

So at a certain level of dilution, any original inspo can and will read more vaguely. But some things to think about:

* **[Soft prairie](https://i.imgur.com/WcLfHpl.jpg) / romantic / Victorian undergarments style:** At least one of top/bottom should be more structured. So a soft romantic vintage style top like the one in the linked photo could work with more structured pants (like the free people crop wide-leg pant from above shown again [here](https://i.imgur.com/KTSxaSY.jpg)). Or the pictured skirt could work with a utility/camp button-down.
* **Socialite on vacation in the Mediterranean style:** These two images show items/outfits that are pretty close, but not quite sturdy enough to feel adventure-y. [The first](https://i.imgur.com/NalDpIw.jpg) is more of a loungewear jumpsuit and while the [second outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/a5/95/25/a595256988539ae346fb99454a5df08e.jpg) is pretty close, the shoes don’t exactly look like they’re made for going places even though they’re flat. Open shoes can work, but I think something more heavy-duty like Birkenstocks fit better.
* **Just straight-up military inspired style:** I think by nature a lot of the pieces or outfits individually could be read as just plain vintage military inspo, but collectively they shouldn’t have a drill sergeant vibe. In another example of accessories making or breaking it, the sleek black boots and black beret bring it more towards [“when you have brunch at 11 and a coup at 12”](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/46/77/a0/4677a02872161d413f0cf08e6b73ce02.jpg). I tend to favor lace-up boots for this style because it feels more boots-on-the-ground and less shiny officer boots, if that makes any sense. Also sticking to lighter earthy tones can keep things more obviously safari inspired.
* **Professor style:** actual professors now obviously wear a larger variety of styles, but I mean that sort of old school ivy league humanities professor look. [This](https://i.imgur.com/jAQExpc.jpg) is a really fun look, but it’s on the formal/buttoned-up side and doesn’t quite have the outdoorsy vibe. I think incorporating at least one more utilitarian/relaxed fit piece can help bring it more towards an explorer/adventurer look.

# FAQ

Questions no one has actually asked me, since I obviously just posted this, but which I've seen cropping up periodically on FFA.

**Cool, now I can dress like a Tolkien elf / sci-fi villain at my new job at the law firm?**

If part of your job description involves wearing a literal uniform for safety/practicality or looking as close to some conservative industry standard as possible, it's probably in your best interest from a career perspective to stick to reserve your creative outfits for the weekend.

There was one true corporate goth “Dark Goddess of the Cubicle Farm” (sadly since deleted) which actually attempted to be fully business casual compliant, and the top comment was basically ""that just looks like business casual with small goth details?"" That’s the point! There’s a spectrum on how hard you can lean into a style. You can incorporate a small flavor of it, or a lot. Your clothes don’t have to be a 100% reflection of WHO YOU REALLY ARE INSIDE every day. Just have fun with it how you can.

**Do I need to have just one style? Do I need to define my style(s) to Fashion properly?**

No, only if you think it will be fun or that having a more cohesive wardrobe will make getting dressed easier for you. Even if you find it helpful to define your style, it doesn’t have to be like, “Atlantic storm goddess who is trying to pass as a schoolteacher in 1940s NYC”. Something like “I like things that are more minimal and structured for my business casual clothes” or “girly-leaning grunge” can also work.

You could still apply the process I outlined here. I just chose more sartorially weird examples because I think most people have a better sense of how to find items that were inspired by things that are obvious to find in mall stores, but it isn't always obvious how to do that if you're starting with movie costume or couture inspo.

Having a sort of mission statement for your wardrobe that you can come back to when shopping or deciding what you need to get rid of can help keep all your pieces more cohesive, which will make creating intentional-looking outfits easier. If you don’t care about having a cohesive outfit or wardrobe, there is no reason to do this. But many people find having some kind of cohesive look aesthetically pleasing and comforting.

You also don't need just one style! I don't militantly stick to one style, but I still like to come up with capsules within my wardrobe that fit more specific aesthetics. You could also have one main style so that most of your clothes will look fine together that you defined based off an intensely-curated Pinterest board, and then the other 20% is just whatever you thought looked nice. Or maybe 80% of your clothes is just whatever you thought looked nice and could wear to work, but you have a small capsule of going-out clothes with a strong aesthetic. Whatever floats your boat.

**Why does FFA have a childish obsession with shoving their wardrobes into overly specific style buckets?**

Because it's a way that people can have fun with clothes. Let 👏 people 👏 like 👏 things

Seriously though, it's an online forum. You're gonna get the people who are really extra into things.

**But why witches??**

"Guide: Packing for Travel, a.k.a., I'm going to [PLACE] in [MONTH], what should I pack!?","This sub gets a lot of questions about packing for travel, and there is a ton of good advice to be found on the topic. This post is an attempt to gather it all together in one place. 

Since people travel to lots of different places for lots of different reasons, this guide will attempt to give you a **strategy** to employ when packing -- it won't tell you exactly which items to pack. And since this is FFA, not a travel subreddit, these tips are mostly for *clothing choices*, not for the *logistics* of packing (though I did include a small logistics section at the end). With the exception of more long-term travel (months at a time), this strategy should work well for a weekend with friends in New York City, a 10-day African safari, visiting family for the holidays, a romantic getaway in Paris, or a month exploring in India.

Packing is the art of choosing the most (1) **comfortable**, (2) **versatile** pieces in your wardrobe that are appropriate for the (3) **weather** at your destination and the (4) **activities** you'll be doing while there.

Addressing these out of order...


**ANSWER TWO MAIN QUESTIONS TO START**

**1: Weather?**

I always start with the weather: What kind of **shoes** will I need, and what kind of **jacket**, if any? 

You will be miserable if you only pack a denim jacket, and it's freezing your entire trip. You'll be similarly miserable if you only pack canvas shoes, and it rains the entire time. So, to ensure your clothes don't distract you from you enjoying your trip, your first step is to pick shoes and jackets that are appropriate for the weather forecast. 

Note: Although you can (and probably should) spend time before your trip thinking about what you might bring, you should wait until the day or two before you leave to actually pack, because the weather forecast changes all the time -- and it will probably change again once you arrive!

**2: Activities?**

The second most important thing to consider is what activities you'll be doing -- even a general idea is useful. Lots of walking? Sight-seeing in an urban metropolis? Visiting a beach? Anything sporty, like hiking or canoeing? Will you be spending time around animals, or on a farm? Mostly outside, or mostly inside? Clubbing, bar-hopping, or fancy dinners? Any modesty requirements for visits to a mosque, the Vatican, etc.? Any formal occasions to plan for?

Answering these questions will help you further narrow down your shoe and jacket choices. A week in London spent eating at Michelin-star restaurants will require very different shoes and jackets than a week spent traipsing through the jungle in Thailand.

**BUILD UPON YOUR CHOSEN SHOES AND JACKETS**

When it comes to choosing items from your closet to pack, let *color* and *proportion* guide you to the most **versatile** pieces you own that you know you'll be **comfortable** wearing.

**Color:** 

If you have a fairly cohesive color scheme in your wardrobe already, that makes it 10x easier to create a smaller capsule for traveling. Here is a guide to [color matching](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1pbmrj/a_guide_to_color_matching/) and one on [personal color analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2hjrhz/an_introduction_to_personal_color_analysis_aka/). 

* **Easy mode:** Bring all neutrals. Everything goes with everything. The easiest choices are [black, white, gray, and denim](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/79/46/73794629f7802109dc122307c39abf29.jpg).

* **Moderate difficulty:** Add one or two ""pop"" colors to your neutral bases. [A Pair and a Spare](http://apairandasparediy.com/2015/06/how-to-pack-the-5-4-3-2-1-guide/) has a [black/white/denim + army green](http://apairandasparediy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/18510052620_35de9bce57_o.png) example. This blog post from [Live Love Sarah](http://livelovesara.com/2017/02/what-to-wear-in-central-europe-outfit-options/) shows a [black/white/gray/denim + blush pink](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/95/fc/e4/95fce4915b9d6aa4694f50fb88ccfd72.jpg) example.

* **Hard mode:** Forget ""neutrals"" and pack what speaks to you. The Vivienne Files is a fantastic resource for [color capsules of all types](http://www.theviviennefiles.com/p/four-by-four-wardrobes.html).

**Proportion:** 

If color is the ""match"" part of a ""mix-and-match"" travel wardrobe, then proportion and silhouette are the ""mix"" part. Just because navy and mustard are complementary colors doesn't mean you can automatically make outfits with every single navy and mustard piece you have. You have to consider proportion and silhouette to make sure the tops and bottoms you choose interface well with each other. (If you've yet to take the time to identify what proportions you prefer and that work for your body, Into Mind has a great [proportions catalog](https://anuschkarees.com/blog/2013/08/25/proportions-catalogue) to peruse. FFA also has [this guide to proportion](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/15sej6/guide_understanding_fit_and_proportion_in_an/).)

Identify one or two silhouettes you want to wear on your trip -- keeping in the mind the shoes and jackets you've already chosen -- and pack items that work well with each other. 

Here are some examples of pairs of silhouettes that contain at least one overlapping element:

* (1) [high-waisted bottoms + cropped-length tops](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/59/8d/2c/598d2c043826bffe5fe94816de4e54ff.jpg) and (2) [fit-and-flare dresses + cropped cardigans](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/312/18488432859_ec11770dce_z.jpg). The cropped cardigans work for both silhouettes: over the dresses, or with the high-waisted pants, maximizing your versatility.

* (1) [maxi skirt + fitted tops](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/38/30/4f/38304f676c4061d61b6699927e760242.jpg) and (2) [loose pants + fitted tops](http://stylishcurves.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4908-2-e1438565592970.jpg). Assuming you coordinate your colors well, all the tops you bring could be worn with all of the bottoms you bring.

* (1) [oversized tops + skinny jeans](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ec/07/b7/ec07b7697ea58b2fd6b74f13877d9f99.jpg) and (2) [mini skirts + oversized pullovers](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/87/e0/7387e0239d5851275f6273b0dd2b98f3.jpg). Again - you can wear the oversized tops with the pants or the skirts, giving you the ability to change up your look and your silhouette with some of the same pieces.

**On comfort:**

Don't try brand-new pieces or new combinations on a trip. If you don't wear it at home, you're unlikely to want to wear it while traveling. And if you don't have experience wearing a piece, you won't know its quirks -- maybe it takes forever to dry, shows water spots, rides up when you walk, wrinkles in a heartbeat, or stinks a lot if you sweat, etc. **Aim to pack things you already wear often.** You know you like them. You know they fit. You know they look good with X shoes or Y jacket. You feel comfortable in them. You feel confident wearing them. These are all important points! You want to enjoy your trip, not spend all of your time feeling uncomfortable in your clothes.

So, based on those four main considerations (weather, activities, versatility, and comfort) you can essentially work yourself through a flow chart of your own closet. Below, I've given two examples of working my way through this strategy when packing for two different types of trips.

**EXAMPLE PACKING EXPERIENCE 1**

4-day trip to visit friends and their new baby in San Francisco in January:

1. What's the weather? Mid-50s F, sunny, no rain forecasted. Great! In that case, I think I'll bring my leather jacket, and I have my choice of shoes since there's no rain. I always walk a lot while I'm in SF, though, so we'll keep comfort in mind. I put insoles in my VANS and find them very comfortable for all-day walking, and since there's no rain the forecast, I should be fine in canvas shoes. I'll probably bring those and my clogs, which are also very comfortable for lots of walking.

2. Since I'm bringing my leather jacket, all of my chunky sweaters are out, because they won't fit under it. So, I'll pick out a couple of thin sweaters and top layers that I know wear well under my leather jacket. 

3. Once I've picked the jacket and a couple of sweaters, I choose some first layers (t-shirts, button-ups, blouses, whatever) that match. I can also start choosing bottoms at this point: for me, it's pants/jeans, because I'm not really a skirt person, especially in cooler temperatures. Remember to keep asking yourself, ""What activities will I be doing?"" I know on this trip, I'll be hanging out at my friends' house with them and their baby, so I don't want to pack fussy fabrics or fancy items like silk or cashmere, because babies can be messy. 

4. At this point, it's useful to start thinking about color. My main neutrals are navy and denim, and most of the other colors in my wardrobe go with those -- and with each other (gray, cream, burgundy, mustard, burnt orange, olive green) -- so it's pretty easy for me to pick some navy/denim bottoms, any combination of tops I like, and go.

5. Now, I consider proportion to make sure the tops and bottoms I chose interface well with each other. Personally, my silhouette of choice is high-waisted bottoms + loose, cropped-length or tucked-in tops. So, I might pack high-waisted dark denim, some tops in cream and gray (mostly fitted that I will wear tucked in since the temperature will be cool), a cropped burnt orange sweater, and a regular navy blue sweater, knowing that I can ""mix and match"" all of it.

**EXAMPLE PACKING EXPERIENCE 2**

8-day trip to Cuba to climb and explore in March: 

1. What's the weather? 80s and 90s F, sunny, but the possibility of rain. So, I'm definitely bringing my Chacos, because those are perfect ""hot + wet"" shoes, especially in a developing country where I won't always be in big cities. I'll probably also bring Birkenstocks for dry days and a slightly more polished look. Jackets? Just my lightweight rain jacket should do.

2. Activities? I'm planning to sightsee and go rock climbing. So, I'm bringing a pair of climbing pants that I can also wear for hiking or horseback riding, etc. Then I add 2 tank tops to climb in, my favorite pair of high-waisted denim shorts, and another tank and tee to wear when I'm not climbing. Two of the four tops I'm bringing are linen, because... hot. The other two are merino wool because they won't start stinking immediately after I sweat in them, and I can wash/dry them quickly if/when they do.

3. It's Cuba and it'll be hot, so I'm bringing a swim suit, because you never know. I'll also pack a casual tank dress that I can wear with the Birks for a nicer dinner look, or as a coverup for any potential beach trips. 

4. Color check: The pants are gray, and the shorts are denim. All of the tops are rusty orange, cream, and gray. The tank dress is navy blue. Looks like I'm good to go! I'll probably also pack my orange and gray flannel for any chilly moments (and the plane). [This is basically my color scheme.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/b3/85/12/b3851225ec78f5bc605461f3960e4f7e.jpg)

5. Proportion check: Pants, shorts, and tees are combos I wear often in the summer. As a bonus, I'm bringing one cropped tee, and I can wear it over the tank dress to create a skirt look -- [a la](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/30/00/38/3000387a854a77134c47878bc513028d.jpg) -- if I want.

**FLESH OUT YOUR OUTFITS**

One important step is to actually build outfits with the items you've chosen before you pack them for good. Lay everything out on your bed to see how the colors look together. Try on outfits to make sure you actually can wear that jacket with that dress, or those shoes with those pants, and that it works -- that you like how it looks.

This is also the time to see how many combinations you can make with the items you've chosen. Can you wear most of your tops with all of your bottoms? What about first and second top layers (sweaters/cardigans over tanks/tees) -- are they flexible and interchangeable? Have you chosen any items that can only be worn with *one* other thing? If so, unless it's for a specific occasion, perhaps reconsider bringing it.

**IN SUMMARY**

1. Start by asking yourself what the weather will be, and what kinds of activities you'll be doing. Choose some shoes and jackets based on the answers to those questions.

2. Use your shoe/jacket picks to help you narrow down your clothing choices, always asking yourself if your choices are appropriate for the weather and your activities.

3. Consider color, proportion, and silhouette to ensure you can mix and match most of what you bring.

4. Bring comfortable, trusted pieces that you're familiar with and already wear often.

**OTHER GENERAL TIPS:**

* **Bring your favorites!** If you have that one sweater you find yourself wearing 2x or 3x per week, pack it! With your limited travel wardrobe, you won't mind wearing that sweater a lot because... you already do.

* Yes, you can **repeat** outfits and **re-wear** items several times. No one will notice. No one will care. Carry a stain remover pen to remove small marks.

* **Scarves and jewelry** can add interest, variety, and formality without taking up much space.

* **Scarves**: use them... (1) as a scarf, (2) as a blanket, (3) as a pillow, (4) as a head covering in conservative or religious countries and settings, (5) as a towel (in a pinch), (6) as a make-shift satchel (hobo-style), (7) as a privacy curtain, or (8) as a skirt (if it's big enough).

* I never recommend traveling with **white** pants, skirts, or dresses -- too much can go wrong.

* In general, I like to travel with **unfussy pieces and fabrics**. Things that won't wrinkle easily. Things that are easy to wash. 

* Consider **wool**: It's lightweight, it dries quickly, it doesn't hold smells, and you can confidently re-wear wool items more times than other fabrics. There are several companies that make high-quality merino wool clothing items that are great for traveling: [Smartwool](http://www.smartwool.com/), [Ibex](http://shop.ibex.com/), and [Icebreaker](http://www.icebreaker.com/en/home) are my favorites.

* For a one-off **formal occasion**, a dress or skirt can get you far: ""dress it up"" or ""dress it down"" with a change of your shoes, jewelry, jacket, and/or hair: [a jersey dress](http://www.athoughtfulplaceblog.com/dressed-up-or-dressed-down/), or [a jumpsuit](https://d2klylognp0re.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/BLG_boutique_support_tart.jpg), or [a lace skirt](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9pHKQfBGuDE/VRl463g3hRI/AAAAAAAAQ-8/Z1cHQXvU6zE/s1600/lace%2Bskirt%2Bdressed%2Bup%2Bdressed%2Bdown.png).

* If **space** is at a premium, bring old socks and underwear and throw them away before you come home. 

* Don't forget **pajamas** -- if you're staying in someone else's home, a hostel, or anywhere else that's not completely private, you'll want a top &amp; bottom you can wear around other people at night. Leggings or joggers + tee, for example. Bonus if either piece is one you can also wear as part of an outfit if you need to.

* I always bring a pair of **cheap rubber flip flops**, no matter my destination. For shower shoes, for wearing around the house / hotel / hostel, to the beach, to the pool -- you never know how they might come in handy.

* If it's a longer trip, consider if you'll be able to do **laundry**. If you can, maybe you can get away with packing a bit less and wearing a smaller number of items more often. 

* **Warm weather tips:** Maxi skirts, maxi dresses, and joggers are great for full coverage that won't make you overheat. Fabric suggestions include linen (though prone to wrinkles) and [wool](http://www.merino.com/wool/the-fibre/5-ways-to-beat-the-heat/). A [linen or chambray button-down](http://www.bodenimages.com/productimages/productLarge/17WSPR_WA785_LAV_W01.jpg) is a great top layer for summer travel. Wear it alone, over a tee, or [tied over a dress](http://brightontheday.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brighton-4-740x1110.jpg).

* **Cold weather tips:** Layers. Wool. Wool socks. Silk long underwear. Uniqlo [Heattech](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech-collection). Lightweight, [packable down jackets](http://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-down-sweater-jacket/84683.html?dwvar_84683_color=BSRB&amp;cgid=womens-jackets-vests-insulated#tile-2=&amp;prefn1=features&amp;prefv1=packable&amp;start=1&amp;sz=24).

**ON FITTING IN / BLENDING WITH LOCALS / NOT LOOKING LIKE A TOURIST**

Some people feel strongly about fitting in with the local style when they travel. If you want to take the opportunity of traveling to a new place to explore a new style, obviously that's fine, but it's usually not *necessary* to worry too much about it -- unless it's a modesty issue for cultural or religious regions. For example: If you're visiting Muslim countries, mosques, temples, the Vatican, or other religious sites or places of worship, you should be aware of and sensitive to the accepted dress out of respect. On the other hand, if you're visiting Stockholm from the U.S., for example, and are just worried about looking ""too American,"" you can probably relax a bit. Millions of people visit Stockholm every year -- its residents are used to tourists and are unlikely to treat you differently no matter if you're wearing an LLBean fleece and [Asics](http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/4/3/6/3/1/7/webimg/571940554_o.jpg) or the latest in Scandinavian minimalism or street style. Do not act obnoxiously or be disrespectful, and you'll be fine.

**ON THE LOGISTICS OF PACKING (esp. for air travel)**

Traveling with a carry-on instead of checking luggage has become the ""cool"" thing to do recently, and there are good reasons to buy into the practice: 

* Many (most?) airlines now charge extra fees for even a single checked bag, so you can save some money by carrying everything on the plane. 

* You can avoid the possibility of lost or delayed luggage by keeping everything with you. 

* You can adapt to last-minute changes in your travel plans (unexpected layover, forced plane change, rerouting, etc.) without worrying about ending up in a different place than your belongings.

* It's easier to physically manage smaller luggage than large suitcases (and maneuver through crowded spaces, onto escalators and trains).

* From a fashion and outfit-building perspective, bringing a smaller number of clothes makes getting dressed easier and faster because you have fewer decisions to make. That means you spend more time enjoying your trip, and less time in your hotel room, deciding what to wear.

Here are some **general tips for packing and traveling light:**

* It helps if your suitcase itself doesn't weigh very much. Every airline has weight restrictions for carry-on items, so be aware of them.

* It's a universal truth that you will completely fill whatever size bag(s) you choose to bring. Pick a smaller bag, and you'll pack less. Pick a bigger bag, and you'll surely pack more.

* [Roll, don't fold.](http://herpackinglist.com/2013/09/rolling-vs-folding/)

* Experiment with [bundle packing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ZrYtRjYfs). Here's a related [""superpack""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtCH6KLdfBs) strategy for just one overnight.

* Using packing cubes reduces wrinkles and keeps your suitcase from being an explosion of fabric and stuff every time you open it: [Eagle Creek](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packing-cubes/l/212) and [eBags](https://www.amazon.com/eBags-Packing-Cubes-3pc-Set/dp/B004C0XZM4) are two popular brands.

* Tuck socks and underwear inside your shoes to maximize space *and* help your shoes keep their shape.

* Use [re-useable shoe bags](https://www.amazon.com/Richards-Homewares-Travel-Shoe-Bag/dp/B000A68EAW) (or use plastic grocery bags) to keep the dirty soles of your shoes off the rest of your clothes. You can also use plastic shower caps to just cover the soles -- I see that tip a lot, but I'm way more likely to have plastic bags than I am to have 4 or 6 plastic shower caps lying around.

* Here are some [tips for packing toiletries](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/01/packing-tips-toiletry-bag_n_6554404.html).

* Consider the orientation of your luggage most of the time. If you have a traditional [rolling carry-on](http://gogreentravelgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/travelers-choice-hardside-rolling-carryon.jpg), arrange heavy things (shoes, toiletries, appliances) so they'll sit at the bottom (at the wheels) when you close the suitcase and stand it upright. That way, heavy things don't put pressure on your clothing items, potentially wrinkling them. It's also easier to pull and steer a rolling suitcase when heavy things are closest to the wheels. In a backpack, weight is best/easiest carried as close to your back as possible, and not too high. One caveat to this: Some airports still require you to actually remove the bag containing your 3-oz.-or-less liquids when you go through security (LHR, for one). You don't want them to be too difficult to get to if that's the case.

* Wear your bulkiest clothing and shoes on the plane (if it makes sense for the weather).

* Almost everywhere will you go will have almost everything you might need. If space is really at a premium, don't bring things ""just in case"" -- for ex., bug spray, umbrella -- you can always buy them in a pinch.

* If you anticipate coming home with significantly more than you brought, bring a [packable duffle](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packable-duffel/d/1399) that can expand to swallow souvenirs and gifts (make sure to attach a luggage tag with your phone number and email address if you plan to check it).

Whew! This guide got really long, but I hope it was still palatable and useful. I'm very open to feedback and am happy to make edits or additions, so please speak up if you have ideas! 

Also, I know I didn't include anything about **business travel / travel for work**. I don't really have any experience with packing suits and other business-casual or business-formal pieces. If someone wants to type up a section on that, I'll be very happy to add it in with credit to you!

LPT: Staying warm and fashionable this winter (Advice from a Canadian).,"*Last year I posted some advice to /r/LifeProTips that was fairly well received in regards to how to stay warm... But I thought it might be appropriate to follow it up with some ffa oriented advice.*

--------

**Note: I'm going to toe the line between fashionable and practical. This advice will neither be the height of fashion, nor the height of performance. If you want straight survival/performance advice, see my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/3u9el0/lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_from/).**

--------

First, let's talk a little about **fabric**. And, the secret I'd like to share with you is that **cotton is the enemy**. Jeans, blouses, dress pants, whatever. If it isn't wool or synthetic, it will get wet, stay wet, and provide very little insulation even when dry, and zero protection from the wind. But since it's generally not possible to avoid wearing cotton for 6 mos of the year, layer some synthetic (or smartwool/merino wool) items underneath any cotton item that you wear. So for instance, an outfit like [this](http://cliqueimg.com/cache/posts/img/uploads/current/images/0/46/821/main.original.640x0c.jpg) is fine, but wear some tights/nylons under the jeans and a insultaing undershirt under the cotton blouse. 

Second, let's talk **fit**. An ideal winter outfit will be well-fitting, yet loose enough to allow for unrestricted movement, but needs to create little sealed pockets of air as bubbles of insulation. Anything flowy/baggy/open will not. Anything super tight restricts blood flow and also causes issues.  So how does this apply to you? If you want to wear a [loose blouse](https://cdna.lystit.com/photos/dc34-2014/02/20/mango-white-flowy-shirt-product-1-17790655-2-051651916-normal.jpeg), that's fine, but wear a synthetic/wool long underwear or tanktop underneath and tuck it into your pants. **You're trying to mimic how a thermos works**. So that goes also for a [shawl type coat](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1SfssKpXXXXaiXFXXq6xXFXXXW/Free-Shipping-Hot-Sale-Women-s-Fashion-Wool-Coat-Elegant-Plus-Size-Cape-Shawl-Poncho-Wrap.jpg). Where possible, wear as many layers under, and create sealed pockets of air.  

And all this sorta segues into my point about heat transfer. You lose heat from the air, water, and induction/contact with cold objects. In addition to the clothing you're wearing, you can minimize these issues by:

* Warming up all the little pockets of air in your [not totally practical winter] clothes prior to going outside. That warm air will provide an additional barrier to protect you from the cold outside.
* Protect yourself from the wind. Yes, cover your ears/face/exposed skin with clothing (toque/scarf/mitts), but also stand in whatever shelter available and walk next to buildings to avoid the wind. 
* Stay dry. Getting wet will give you hypothermia/frostbite in minutes vs hours. If you feel yourself starting to sweat, immediately take off a layer... Or two. Whatever it takes. If it's slushy you're usually better off with $20 gumboots and a good pair of socks, rather than non-waterproof boots. 
* Protect yourself from conduction heat loss. If you're in a cold stadium/arena, be sure you have [something insulating to sit on](https://www.amazon.com/Outwolves-foldable-CAMPING-sitting-BACKPACKING/dp/B012JNYLG4). If you're standing outside, stand on a piece of cardboard or carpet ... or even wood, instead of the concrete. 

------

So what does my winter warm look like? Ideally it's a look that allows you to add warmth and remove as needed.

[**Here's a little inspiration album.**](http://imgur.com/a/E3pLs) 

----

Items of note:

* A large crossbody purse that can hold my ""inside shoes"" and any layers that I need to shed and stash when I come indoors.
* Toques, leg warmers or thigh high socks, and touchscreen compatible gloves. 
* [Fleece lined tights](https://www.amazon.com/Berkshire-Womens-Cozy-Tight-Fleece-Lined/dp/B00W50XF46) and a ton of bulky sweaters and sweater dresses. 
* A stupid amount of scarves. My favourite right now is this enormous wool scarf (looks similar to [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a6/78/86/a67886f55ef72bc99456e3377938ea30.jpg)). But blanket scarves are also great... Just make sure that the scarf has some ""warmth"" to it. Some of the more silken fabrics (some pashminas) aren't as great. 
* A reasonably warm, somewhat low budget, [coat](http://www.cartoondollemporium.com/forum/pics/cdeblog/2015/03/green-jackets-1024x1024.jpg) (on the left) from Garage. And while it technically breaks the rules by being cotton, I live in a very dry climate, plus it comes with a heavy quilted synthetic liner and polar fleece down the back of my neck. **But adding more layers is a much better idea than spending ungodly sums on a high-end winter coat that you'll only be able to wear when it's really cold.** 
* [Expensive] High quality waterproof boots. I have two pairs. One is [practical](http://www.sorel.com/womens-joan-of-arctic-boot-1708791.html?cgid=women-boots&amp;dwvar_1708791_variationColor=052#start=5), [one is more fashionable](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/67/84/d5/6784d52bcb7aabedaecb3c2e8acf2544.jpg). If you're gonna make it rain, make it rain on a high quality pair of waterproof winter boots. 

--------

Bonus! Winter safety for women:

* Many (lower) quality shoes tend to have plastic bottoms that become ridiculously slippery when cold. So make sure you take steps [lol] [to improve your traction](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/2mpolw/why_do_womens_shoesboots_so_rarely_have_any_grip/). 
* Make sure you tell people where you're going, when you should be arriving, and plan for a way to get home (my town is notorious for cabs disappearing when it's cold, so I always have an emergency back up who I can wake up if necessary). 
* Consider adding a [space blanket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_blanket) to your purse. They're teeny tiny and could save your life. 
* Bring a cell phone charger with you wherever you go.
* Hoods drastically reduce your hearing and peripheral vision. Consider wearing a toque instead (especially at night).",femalefashionadvice,352,1481914519.0,128,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/5ipzpr/lpt_staying_warm_and_fashionable_this_winter/
Europe - A Guide to the lost and confused traveller,"The plane tickets have been bought, your hotel is booked, the date is approaching and you’re looking at an empty suitcase wondering what to pack. You want to wear your comfortable sneakers, but some say “In Europe, no one wears sneakers and everyone looks out of a streetstyle blog.” Is there any truth to that? Can you wear sneakers and not stick out like a sore thumb? This guide will hopefully help clear up a few misconceptions and generalizations about Europe so that packing will be the easiest part of the trip.

**General information**

Europe may not be a big continent *(some may say that it’s part of the eurasian continent, but hey, semantics)*, but it makes up for it in historical, cultural and geographical differences. It consists of around 50 states and luckily something won’t be considered offensive in one and the pinnacle of fashion in other. These will be general guidelines more about the “dos” rather than the “do nots” with a focus at the end on country/city specifics. 

Also, you’ll probably always look like a tourist. It’s okay! Big cities are filled with them, visiting from the neighbouring country or the other side of the world. 

**Weather**

The easiest way to gauge how the weather will be is to search for the average weather at the time of the year you’ll be visiting. Be specific: “Paris average temperatures March” will be much better than “France average temperatures March”. When closer to the time of the departure look at the weather forecasts. I think it’s always better to expect the worst and overpack a little because running around trying to find warm sweaters or a rain poncho is a waste of time. Layers are of course a great plan, things that you can both wear on their own or layered in case of necessity. Also, I have used [this site](http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php) in the past with some success in getting a general picture of the climates I’m travelling to.

**Transportation - planes**

If you’re going to be flying in low cost airlines, read their most recent guidelines very closely and follow them to the letter! Measurements for carry-on baggage differ between carriers and some are stricter than others. If you plan on shopping, try to pack as light as possible so that you have space in your suitcase.

**Transportation - daily life**

Preferably, go for a bag that is always in your sight. Keep it as small as possible and not easy to open. Carry your transportation card(s) in an outside pouch or pocket. It doesn’t need to be an unbreakable fortress, a crossbody with a zipper is more than enough. 

If you’re going to a city where biking is a common means of transportations, plan ahead for that(  “Good type of skirts for biking include: maxi, midi, skater, tulip, anything loose that doesn't ride up.” /u/slugmilkshake).

If you’re concerned about travel safety (especially if you’re going to be travelling alone), I like the Adventurous Kate blog... This is a good list of travel safety tips, really for anyone: http://www.adventurouskate.com/top-10-travel-safety-tips-for-women/ (though her tip about Birkenstocks in Paris is wrong ) (this was added by /u/schauspielerin and it’s great advice).

**Footwear**

Go for comfortable, waterproof or easily dried. Yes, you can wear sneakers. No one will care or target you for wearing them. Choose pairs you know are comfortable and that you’ve had for a while to break in. If you want to be on the safe side in terms of style, go for things like Converse or Vans over the Asics you run in. 

Additionally, according to /u/Miasonna Birkenstocks Arizonas are still seen as a pair of house slippers in places like Austria,. The models that look more sandals are okay.

**Clothing**

Casual clothing is fine. Everyone wears jeans and a lot wear shorts. What can stand out is if you’re looking overly sporty-- out of a North Facecatalog with mountain boots, or are plastered in shirts branded with American universities or the local sports team of your choice. But if you’re actively thinking about how to not look like the Standard American Tourist, you’re already ahead of the game. In some countries, wearing leggings as pants (especially thin ones) is not common and the same goes for flip-flops. 

If you’re going to a city where biking is a common means of transportations, plan ahead for that(  “Good type of skirts for biking include: maxi, midi, skater, tulip, anything loose that doesn't ride up.” /u/slugmilkshake).

**Nightlife**

If you plan on going out, research well what types are available and what interests you. In some southern countries going out is something very casual and done outside, in patios or literally sitting in the streets so there’s no need to pack fancy clothing and heels.

**Country specific advice**

*Portugal* - While the cobblestones are a trademark of the country, they are very slippery when wet. This coupled with the not so flat cities makes shoes with good grippy soles essential. 

*Netherlands* - The Netherlands is absolute balls for heels. Seriously, worst sidewalks ever in the historic city areas. I have fallen so many times because of polished smooth uneven stones, slimey grime coating them, and the ever present thin layer of rain water/dew. as per /u/DeineBlaueAugen

*Northern Europe* -  It can still get cold at night (especially in June). Also, there can be a lot of mosquitoes in the more remote places in Scandinavia, so have something long-sleeved with you. /u/slugmilkshake

*Switzerland/Germany* - In winter it's obviously cold but as long as you're not going into the mountains you won't need snowboot(...). The streets are normally cleared of any snow. Public transport is ubiquitous but you'll do your fair share of walking. (...)Even in summer, it rains on the regular, so bring an umbrella or even better a raincoat. /u/Sparkly_Kitten

Changing your Style and Keeping Calm,"Alternate Title: How To Wear Clothes (But Like, Mentally)

So every week or two I see posts here titled ""How do I wear what I want to wear?"" or ""How do I get over the anxiety of trying on a new (to me) style or outfit?"" or ""How do I pull off \[x trend/things I've never worn before\]?""

But if it were that easy we wouldn't be making this [many](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/d8zztb/choosing_an_outfit_and_sticking_with_it/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9rw27u/how_do_you_get_up_the_courage_to_change_your/) [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/20seh6/how_do_you_feel_confident_in_certain_clothes/) [it](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cphhep/how_do_i_actually_wear_what_i_want_without_caring/ewpjfh5/?context=3) [all](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9ta4ob/item_from_your_closet_that_you_like_but_arent/) [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/37mbfc/how_long_did_it_take_you_to_finally_be_confident/) [time](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/63bmxh/girls_who_are_confident_and_happy_with_their/) (btw a lot of good advice across these thread). I'm hoping to create a compendium for reasons why ""just do it"" doesn't feel ""right"" and then responses to that. So if anyone has other feelings that hold them back aside from the ones I've listed, please feel free to add them! Especially if they found a solution for that way of thinking!

Just to make things clear: This is not a guide on ""how to wear something that might not be appropriate for the context I'm wearing it to"". If you work in finance in an incredibly stuffy office with rules, regulations, a mean boss and/or judgy clients, you're going to have to follow the explicit dress code. Sometimes these codes are implicit, and you work in a chill tech bro place where you're expected not to ever wear a tie not once not even a bowtie, or they're implicit in that no one expects to say anything to you in your manufacturing job, but there's a damn good reason everyone's wearing steel toed boots.

**I'm new to fashion and want to wear clothes deliberately, but terrified of doing this for one or many reasons**.

It's possible, when taking on any new endeavor, to be afraid because it feels like you don't have enough 'background knowledge' or knowledge of the 'rules'. You might make 'mistakes'. In this way, I would argue that fashion is similar to art- -I'm not sure there are mistakes. Maybe you'll discover that silver doesn't look good on you, or that you actually hate high socks, but you won't know until you try it on and walk around!

Doing it this way is costly though--some ways to mitigate cost are to really do research before hand\* as to what you might like, to try things on before you by them as much as you can, try to shop from places that have liberal return policies and also try to buy a cheaper version of the new thing before you spend more money on it that you'll have buyer's remorse about.

\*Think about what things you want to change and *why*. Are you trying to look more professional in the workplace? Do you want to dress in a way that expresses a unique part of your identity? Are there a certain set of adjectives you're hoping to project with your clothes (btw I rec [wardrobe architect](https://blog.colettehq.com/wardrobe-architect) for thinking about this)? When you figure out the details of what and why, the how gets easier (I can look more edgy by adding these sorts of fabric/construction details) and then you can feel confident in your choice of clothing to portray what you want and that could lessen the stress of wearing it out (I think).

It's possible that you're not actually 'scared', you're more stressed out by the idea that you'll have to spend more time thinking about what to wear. That's fair! But with all things there's a learning curve, and eventually planning outfits will become easy--or maybe you'll have curated your wardrobe in such a way that you could pull any four things together and it could work: either way the human brain thrives on making things efficient and you'll find that routines and patterns emerge naturally.

**I'm not new to fashion, but I've created this 'visual idea of myself' and I'm scared of changing it up**.

I get this. Change is hard! I'm not sure why people keep calling humans 'soooo adaptable' because change is something I think we're really good at resisting, ignoring and outright denying for the sake of continuing on even if it isn't comfortable to do so. You are working against a biological instinct here and will therefore need to give yourself every advantage against it.

1) After making the purchase or style decision or what have you that you make, say, out loud, ""I will wear this on Wednesday"" or ""I will wear this to Karen's birthday party"". It's hard to break a promise to yourself.

2) If you have friends who are going to something that you want to wear an outfit to, ask them what their outfits are and show them yours! This is an easy way to get feedback on your change and also, honestly, some happy validation from your friends, who will (if they're supportive--if not see below) tell you that you look good and psych you up to wear it. Also, now you can't chicken out.

3) Exposure therapy! Kiiinda. Wear the outfit or thing to a place no one will see you. A place you want to go but no one wants to go with you, for example, is a good one (like an art museum). Feel cool and new and shiny! Use this feeling when you wear the same/similar outfit to a regular errand. Wear it to an appropriate gathering of humans that already know you. Now you've worn it three times. It's a part of your wardrobe!

It will help here, to think about why you want to make the change you're making as well (see the above asterisk). If you can trust that you're making an informed decision, you can trust in your choice.

**Lumen, you don't get it, where I am right now, people** ***will*** **notice if I change, and they** ***will*** **be weird or mean about it.**

Fuck those people. 

But I understand that that's not useful so here's maybe a more nuanced approach.

Rule #1 (for **everyone**): **Do not fiddle. With. Your Clothes.** 

I've noticed that people comment that something doesn't 'suit' someone when that person gives vibes of discomfort with that thing, like constantly adjusting a neckline (I have a friend who was terrified of showing cleavage in one top and did it so often that before I hadn't noticed the top had a large-ish swooping neckline and then after seeing her do it 3 times I kept looking at her hands the next time she did it), constantly pulling things down, fiddling with buttons, folding up and down a shirt sleeve, general fiddling (tbh if you're a chronic fiddler it's possible no one will think this is weird?). 

Fiddle as much as you want at home. In front of your mirror. If you are wearing a button down off the shoulder or something (is this a thing cool people still do? idk) feel free to try it a million different ways, position it in any number of combinations, adjust and readjust as necessary. Feel free to even take pictures of all the looks! But once you're on the street, it's not something you're wearing. It's just a part of what you look like today and you aren't even aware of it--like your nose. It's on your face, but do you look? No! DON'T LOOK AT YOUR NOSE.

Rule #2: Posture matters.

People trying new things and feeling weird about them tend to slouch (more, if they're slouchers/a modern human in this world of needing to look down all the time). This makes clothes look like they don't fit, and makes bodies look...odd. People notice this change, and will associate it to your clothes.

Rule #3: There will always be stressful people.

People don't like change. It's why parents pick fights with kids when they're leaving home for the first (or millionth) time, it's why significant others freak out at unplanned haircuts. Change reminds them that they too need to be changing and also that they don't actually *know* you. Even if you're doing a small thing, someone might say something to bring you down or back to 'normal' because they're scared. Don't take on someone else's fear, everyone does things at their own pace and they'll get used to this new you eventually.

**Shit, Lumen, I might have a deeper problem than this**.

You're not alone! If you feel like you don't look good in the mirror in a really frequent way, if you're worried about a flaw you think you might have and feel like you have to focus your entire life and closet around it, if feelings of distress about your body (in or out of clothes) are getting in the way of your social or professional (or any adjective here) life, I think you should try talking to people (ideally a therapist!) about it. This is not an issue I'll be able to help with as a rando voice on the internet or as someone saying ""Guuuuurl just do it!!"" this is something that might take longer to unlearn, but you can unlearn it!

Hell, even if you think things about changing styles that are mean to yourself--y'know the ""I can't ever pull this off because I'm too x"" or ""this is for y people and I'm a k person"" or ""I'm not adjective enough to wear this"", you're being too mean to yourself. Everyone can try everything--the internet will ascribe different styles to different bodies, but we see those fake rules broken all the time and we love it.

Also, body dysmorphia is labeled this one ""THING"" that you either have or don't have, but I can't imagine living as a woman in the world and not existing on a spectrum of having ""unhealthy thoughts about your body looking a certain way""--I feel most of the time as though I've worked through my issues with regard to this, but then circumstances change or I hear something from someone or read something on the internet and find that I haven't perfectly gotten over *all* of it. I think someone reading this might say ""okay I think I can't pull this off, but I don't have Body Dysmorphia omg Lumen stop being overdramatic and patronizing etc etc.""--which fine, you can totes have these feelings while having a largely healthy body image thing going on--but it still isn't true that you can't pull something off and also someone else who does have BDD might express their anxieties using the same exact language, I can't tell who's generally okay but commenting on societal expectations of body, and who's really stressed or sad through the internet.

When this sort of disordered pattern of thinking is something you're grappling with ""just do it!"" might sometimes work, but it also might not. Please, DO NOT beat yourself up over not being ""confident"" enough or ""liking yourself well enough"" to wear the whatever it is that is giving you trouble! All change takes time, and changing your thoughts require more time than just changing a tee shirt. As always, I'm a big advocate for therapy. It's great. In an ideal world everyone has access to mental and physical health experts at all times, but if that's not a thing you can do there are people online who can help, and even apps made by therapists that try to make things more accessible for people! Also talk therapy isn't the only kind of therapy, remembering to spend time with friends and taking care of yourself (eating well but also happily, doing fun things with your body, looking at trees) are all important!

**Fashion is supposed to be fun, friendos**. **Let's** **have a fun time.** 

Also, as I said above, if anyone is interested in chiming in with tactics that work for them, that'd be great! This is *not* at all a comprehensive list, but idk--I thought it might be useful.",femalefashionadvice,509,1570738663.0,28,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/dg3vgn/changing_your_style_and_keeping_calm/
2018 Low Buy Year Summary,"Hi Ladies! 

I was inspired to post this by the post yesterday with everyone's goals of no/low buys for the year. This is pretty difficult for a lot of us without a plan. Its good to set intentions, but I kind of made a action plan to do it, and I kept notes of my progress. This is an honest accounting of how I did for the year 2018. 

I started this personal plan Last year when there was a lot of discussion on here about [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/opinion/sunday/shopping-consumerism.html) NYT article about a year of No-Buying. I was inspired by it but wasn't going to commit to a No-Buy year. I decided to make my own rules and see how I stuck with it for the year.

I ended up being laid off in January- so while I have plenty to live off of- I knew I had to change my buying habits a lot as I want to start a business and also live more sustainably without chasing luxury items and endless consumption of new- things.  My lifestyle doesn't require it, and honestly- I know I have a bad ass wardrobe and I love styling and dressing pretty eclectically/ distinctively.

Some notes- I am 41, American/ but have lived abroad for the last 7 years (Paris/ 3years, and now South Africa for almost 4 years.) I have been a maximalist for a while- and my lifestyle &amp; environments &amp; work needs have changed considerably over the years- I have quite a collection of everything from vintage (used to be a dealer)- to high end ""luxury"" brands. I have also bought used/resale/vintage for over 20 years, so while I still lover certain brands or designers- I rarely buy fast fashion, full price or even brand new. I am super happy when I travel to create tightly edited monochromatic capsules (and I travel a lot!) but I love having so many options at home. 

**Here was my ""Plan"" for 2018 and How I Did**

**1. I started off making a wish list of items for the year-** this included white whale/long term wish list items (i.e. Red Chloe Susannas) , foreseeable replacements (i.e. ""black chucks"") and an allotment of ""wild cards"" (I think I started with 5 for the year)- where I could buy something on impulse.  I could edit this list if something no longer appealed to me or was just- not a priority anymore. (i.e. ""Red Purse""). Overall I think there were like 10 wishlist/foreseeable replacements and 5 wild cards. I added/ edited this list as a draft in my Inbox as an easy way to make notes of things I bought.

**2. I made rules for the year of things I was absolutely NOT allowed to buy.**   
\- anything with stripes (confession: bought one striped tank)  
\- black or white or cream silk shirts (I have way more than my lifestyle warrants)  
\-Socks (Confession: bought one pair of socks in a tourist emergency)  
\-bras (Goal Achieved!)

**3. I made additional rules for ""trade-outs""**  
\- to buy 1 new tshirt = have to get rid of 3 (kind of followed this)

\- to buy 1 new shoe- have to get rid of 2  (pretty much followed this!)

**4. Made a priority of selling/ decluttering.** Sold quite a bit to TRR (which included hauling a MASSIVE suitcase of goods to the US on my annual visit) and selling locally at a high end resale shop. Also gave away a ton of of ""skinnier"" clothes to a good friend who has my old size/ and style) Still have bags of giveaways in my garage.

All this being said- I didn't stick to my list  OR rules. I bought a lot more than I planned- BUT still considerably less than in any year past. 

**5. Here is how I did.** 

Total Sold (cash) $650  
Total Remaining Store Credit (all on TRR) $1400  
Total Spent in Store Credits: $420  
Total Spent in Cash: $2295  
Not tracked but probably embarrassingly high amount: Shipping Costs to South Africa &amp; Duties 

Targeted # of Purchases for the year: 15  
Total Amount of Clothing Items Bought: 30  
\# Articles Used: 12  
\# Articles New: 18 (though sometimes I have bought things on TRR that are technically ""New"" but on a resale site - whatever, ""new-ish)

**Itemized List:**  
Dresses: 3  
Tops (incl jackets, sweaters, tees etc): 10  
Bottoms: 4  
Shoes: 6 (including one pair that was a gift)  
Accessories: 6 (2 waist bags, 1 purse, 3 pairs of sunglasses -but I lost one pair)

**6. Overall Summary of 2018**

I don't feel terribly bad about the amount of number of items I bought this year. It was more than I intended, but It's been eye opening to keep track for the first time! I think I did really well by doing some purging and making money off of the purges. I sold things I had impulse bought in the year before during some really dark times. I gave away a lot too. 

The things I bought I actually DO wear and most were planned choices (i.e. I wanted a pair of black camo trousers and searched high and low and got the most amazing pair- wearing them right now!)

Sometimes shit happens! I was on holiday and I brought the WORST pair of sneakers for the trip- so my feet were so miserable I had to stop and buy some new walking shoes. My list for the year I had listed new Chucks (my black and white ones were either destroyed or are looking pretty haggard.) I ended up buying Red Chuck Hightops instead. They were fun and I love them and my feet were so happy. Unplanned purchase but so needed! Note to self: don't bring 1/2 size too small vans slip ons to walk all over cobblestone streets in Europe. NO GOOD. 

I feel like I learned a lot about myself this year through a life coaching course I took, and a lot of critical analysis of my lifestyle and actual personal goals. I have stopped buying for the lifestyle I WANT and I am now buying less or not at all for the low key lifestyle I HAVE.  I KNOW I can do even MORE this coming year (see 2019 goals below).

Overall I am proud that I kept track and was accountable to myself for my consumption and spending. I got great deals on some things that I truly love (my MVP has been a Old Stock NWT gold leather vintage Bottega Veneta purse for $185! I wear it all the time!)  and have enhanced my wardrobe. I truly like being awake and conscious about my consumption instead of being ashamed of it, hiding my purchases, excessive, and always WANTING new things (instead of appreciating what I have) and also ignoring the costs and volume of new things entering into my life. 

It may look like I did not stick to my goals this year and it was a failure. But I only see progress and achievement. 

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Fashion/Shopping Goals for 2019**

\- No more mail order from abroad. The shipping and duties are crazy and the wait time is aggravating and I have burned myself SO\_MANY\_TIMES (2017 I'm looking at YOU!) by not loving the things or they are not fitting right and not being able to return from abroad. Waste of Money!

\- That being said- I have a $1400 in Store credit to TRR which I would like to utilize as MOST of my shopping budget for the year, but I don't want to ship internationally. So I will use the Store Credit when I LOVE something and can send to a relatives house or a friend traveling to see me or just wait to get it until I travel back to the US. No instant gratification. Is what it is. 

\- Buy more local/indie products in South Africa if I fall in LOVE with something. I am moving away this year and want a few more things from some local designers  
\- MEND, Tailor, and RENEW pieces of clothing I already own. One of my favorite t-shirts I have right now used to be a pale pink linen Isabel Marant Etoile t-shirt. I NEVER wore it until I over-dyed it a dark slate grey. Now I wear it all the time. I have lots of things that I don't wear because the hem is half falling out, I don't love the length or some other minor thing that keeps me from wearing it. I have a new tailor, some skills of my own and my creativity. I can refresh my wardrobe by fixing the things I have.

\- Say goodbye to my closet/collection of heels/wedges. I have SO MANY and I wear them so rarely. I love them like children and there are some beautiful gems.. And they take up so much space. But they just don't fit my lifestyle anymore and they haven't for a long time. I want to curate and sell what I can. Reduce by half??  
\- Take part of styling challenges and enjoy my closet. I started this already this year and it is really fucking fun. I like my clothes, my weight is relatively stable, I have been learning to appreciate my body how it is (and not waiting to wear something because ""it would look better if i lost 5-10 pounds""- Now I am wearing it anyway, I have clothes that are fun to style and tons of great accessories. It's Time to appreciate what I have accumulated, enjoy it as a hobby without the need to get more more and more.

\- I want to Learn to use my cameras better and take photos of my outfits. I am not comfortable with sharing photos very often, and I would like to share my creativity more. Is this lame? 

\- Set a target number of shopping items and wildcards this year and \_Stick to it\_. Continue tracking spending. Write down any wish list items and revisit to see if I still even want it. I think I am going to shoot for 15 again.   


\-Get a clothes steamer. I have wanted one forever since I worked in retail a zillion years ago. It's legit The fastest and easiest way to look amazing when you get dressed.   
\- Erase shopping apps off my phone (TRR and Ebay are my weaknesses, but honestly the TRR website sucks so much in comparison to the app !) I want to stop wasting my time by scrolling through saved searches and feeds to shop for things that are far away, that would require spending money I don't need to spend and wanting things that are always VERY similar or variations on things I already own. It's a double edged sword with that Store Credit sitting around tho. 

  
If you read all of this - Thanks for that! I hope this helps you put your goals in action for 2019 by making your own rules for yourself and then tracking it. I love this forum because everyone is so supportive. Y'all encouraged me this whole last year, and now I am going to make more improvements this year. Good luck on your goals everyone!

A Summertime Eurotrip Mini Capsule Review,"I always love reading about your capsule wardrobes, especially for travel, so I decided I’d give it a try. I just got back (well, like 2 weeks ago) from 11 days in Europe and am overall pretty pleased with my packing efforts, save for a few changes I will make next time as discussed below. This was the first time I actually put a little bit of effort into packing instead of my usual frantic ‘throw shit in a bag and hope for the best’ strategy. 

**The plan:**
My boyfriend and I had a wedding to attend near Milan so we decided to turn it into a full week’s European holiday. We flew into Zürich to explore for 2 days. Flights there were cheaper than to Milan and neither of us had been before so we decided to have a little pre-wedding adventure. We then took a bus to Milan and drove out to Lake Garda for the wedding weekend. From Milan we flew to Valencia, met up with his parents and stayed there one night before driving to Barcelona. We spent 3 days in Barcelona and then finally we all flew to London for our last 2 days. I needed to pack a combination of city wear, beach wear, and wedding attire, though packing for the warm weather made it a little bit easier. My wardrobe is already pretty neutral so it was pretty easy to pick things that match, but I went for blacks, whites, denim and pastel pink/purple.

**What I brought:**

Tops:
- white tee
- black tee
- lavender tee
- Navy tee
- long sleeve striped pink/white linen button up
- white short sleeve button up 
- Black linen tank top
- Black polka dot spaghetti strap top
- White spaghetti strap top
- Lavender sweatshirt
- Grey workout tank top 

Bottoms:
- straight leg jeans
- Jean shorts
- black skirt
- Black running shorts

Dresses:
- floral dress (for wedding)
- black poplin midi dress

Shoes:
- Maroon running shoes
- Black cross strap sandals
- Black mules
- Tan flip flops
- white sneakers 
- black heels (for wedding)

Swimsuits:
- Black one piece
- Paisley one piece 
- Black two piece

Underthings:
- Black bra
- Nude bra
- Sports bra (high support)
- Sports bra (low support, mostly for sleeping)

Bags:
- Rolling carryon suitcase- all clothing and toiletries 
- Small green backpack- camera, book, journal, headphones, misc. plane activities and supplies 
- Black bum bag- passport, phone, wallet 
- Small black shoulder bag- packed in suitcase ( for wedding)
- Tote bag- packed in suitcase 

[All Outfits](https://imgur.com/a/nn7BiJ3): (I also posted these to the  WAYWT a couple weeks ago)

[Day 1](https://imgur.com/a/rGJ3FxG): landed early morning in Zurich and spent the day exploring the city, swimming at the seebad and a ton of walking around. I wore the black bikini underneath for easy swim-to-street transitions. The skirt was awesome for throwing on over a damp bathing suit because it let me air dry without walking around either half naked or with a wet butt.

[Day 2](https://imgur.com/a/yXXsLT6): another big day of walking and exploring Zurich, much hotter today. We swam in the lake again and I again struggled with the dilemma of either walking around half naked or with a wet butt- I opted for the wet butt and was not happy. Should have worn the skirt again (or planned my day better)

[Day 3](https://imgur.com/a/3Ml17Ul): mostly a travel day. We took the bus from Zurich to Milan (which was, by the way, a beautiful ride) and I opted for jeans for sitting on a kind of gross bus for 4 hours. Once in Milan we had to find the car rental and drive about 2 hours further to Lake Garda. My [2nd outfit](https://imgur.com/a/6hh7aAu) for drinks with the bride and groom to-be. I was worried about being too dressy but it was actually perfect. 

[Day 4](https://imgur.com/a/t8KyqWD): wedding day! We had the whole morning to explore Lake Garda. I was worried about further sunburn on my arms after two brutal days of me not putting enough sunscreen on in Zurich, so I went for my long sleeve linen top, which also doubled as a good coverup after swimming because it’s a bit oversized and covers my butt so I don’t feel super weird walking around in just that and a bathing suit. And later, my [wedding festivities outfit](https://imgur.com/a/gMCJXK8). I usually love this dress because I don’t have to wear a special bra with it, but it was so hot that day and I regretted wearing a dress that was so form fitting. 

[Day 5](https://imgur.com/a/nAwuNYZ): for a quick flight from Milan to Valencia and a full day exploring the city of Valencia. I didn’t swim that day, but the skirt was fantastic for keeping cool. 

[Day 6](https://imgur.com/a/yN2L6mL): mostly traveling via car from Valencia to Barcelona. We stopped along the way at a few little towns to swim in the sea, but since we were in the car I could just change in and out of my swim suit. I wore my black one piece that day. 

[Day 7](https://imgur.com/a/CYiklQW): Barcelona, full day in the city. My feet were feeling a bit sore so I decided to wear my running shoes. I wish they were plain black or grey, but I don’t mind how they look with the black skirt and plain tee. I think the sporty bum bag further helps give this outfit a more athleisure-y look. 

Day 8: Barcelona and I don’t have a photo but I wore the denim shorts, linen black tank top and the black strap sandals with my bum bag. We did a lot of walking again but these sandals are super comfy so it wasn’t too bad! Today was probably the hottest day so I’m glad I went sleeveless. 

[Day 9](https://imgur.com/a/IeFgij4): Barcelona and a flight to London. I threw my sweatshirt on for airport/airplane times. 

[Day 10](https://imgur.com/a/3VIEU8h): London. Probably my favorite holiday outfit. I love all black and I think the silhouette is very clean and smart. It was a little chilly in the morning so I threw my sweatshirt on.

[Day 11](https://imgur.com/a/qGbu5Zi): London, a bit chillier and we met up with some friends for brunch so I tried to look a little more put together. I really love this top, even though linen isn’t really easy to travel with, because it’s so light and I can wear it as a top or a beach coverup. [Final outfit](https://imgur.com/a/hcmNR3i)for the flight home, swapped out the button up for a tee and sweatshirt and put on my white sneakers. 
 
**Thoughts**
My uniform for the trip was primarily denim shorts or the black skirt with a cotton tee. I wore the long sleeve button up shirt twice, and didn’t wear the short sleeve button up at all, which is unusual because that’s usually my go-to for the beach. I’d probably pack them both again though. I got some use out of the linen tank and the black polka dot tank, though next time I’d probably only bring one since they’re both black. Probably the linen tank because it’s more breathable. I didn’t wear the white tank top, I think mostly because it was stuffed in the bottom of my bag and I’d forgotten about it.. so I’d leave that out next time too.

the MVP of the trip was definitely the black skirt. In 32 degree C heat it was SO much better than shorts. I’ve never been a skirt person but I’d definitely consider getting it in another color, especially since I plan to wear it with tights in the cooler weather too. I was debating bringing a second, midi-length skirt too, which I would definitely throw in next time. I’m 100% team skirt now. A close runner up for MVP was the bum bag- I bought it at a secondhand shop kind of just for a laugh and my boyfriend mocks me endlessly about it but it is actually SO USEFUL especially for traveling. I love having my phone, wallet and passport in an easily accessible spot that isn’t my pockets. I also used it as my everyday bag for walking around the city. I’m glad they’re making a comeback because it’s been super practical and useful. I had packed a little canvas tote bag for my everyday stuff (which is what i usually use to run errands and stuff at home), but didn’t use it at all. I much prefer having my valuable things attached to my body so there is no opportunity for me to accidentally leave it somewhere or have it swiped. 

I was hoping to wear the black dress more than once, but it was so hot I didn’t reach for it after I wore it initially for the pre wedding drinks. We had a big brunch with some friends planned and i was going to wear it then but it ended up not happening. Still, I think it’s always good to have one versatile dress just in case.

I didn’t wear the jeans except for travel days and my last day in London, which again was just because of the heat. I’d probably bring a pair of joggers instead next time for traveling, although if it were a couple degrees cooler I’d be wearing the jeans more often. I think I’d actually be scared to go anywhere without a pair of jeans!

I think I really only needed 2 bathing suits- I think next time I’ll just bring one bikini and one one piece.

I didn’t wear the mules at all. I think the black cross strap sandals were enough for my “nicer” casual shoe. I suppose if I had more plans to meet up with friends or nice dinners or something I’d consider bringing them again, but for this kind of trip I definitely didn’t need em. 

I made a critical error with my flip flops- everyone told me that the Rainbows are tough to break in and the first few weeks would be a blister-fest. I had just gotten them and reaaaalllly wanted to wear them and didn’t listen so naturally after an hour had managed to destroy both of my feet. So I didn’t wear them for the remainder of the trip, though I’d bring them again once (if ever) they’re more broken in. 
  
I’d love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions for improvement!",femalefashionadvice,80,1565031223.0,30,https://reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/cmf5y2/a_summertime_eurotrip_mini_capsule_review/
[FIRST POST] I took pictures of my outfits for a month and now I'm looking for CC,"Last month I challenged myself to take a picture every day of my outfits to get an idea of how I dress and to effectively get CCW. I missed a few days, and a few days are marred by having to wear work shoes, but I got a good sampling of my style and how I tend to throw things together. I ended up buying a lot of new clothes in the process, so I'm currently on a no-buy until I move some stuff through Poshmark and donate the rest.

Very sorry for subpar photo quality (I live alone and am usually in a rush in the mornings when I do this, hence the mirror selfies), but criticism is still super-welcomed. I got some super helpful advice yesterday in the WAYWT thread, but some users mentioned that this might merit its own thread. Try to be gentle!

[Album of ~30 days of outfits](http://imgur.com/a/hGU5W#0)

About Me:

* **Height**: 5'3""
* **Age:** 25
* **Measurements:** 35"" x 25.75"" x 36"" (bust, waist, hips)
* **Body Type:** Pretty solidly hourglass, albeit a petite one
* **Why?:** I want to look more put together, dress my shape well, and look really well-styled. I'm not trendy, so I'm drawn to classic looks but because of that I want to avoid preppy, boring, sorority-girl, matchy-matchy and so on. Classic but with a bit of an edge. Ladylike but not Modcloth ""quirky."" To give you an idea of my personal style safe zone, see [this pinboard](http://pinterest.com/paonecarlate/my-style/). I really love Audrey Hepburn (not just Holly Golightly), but my go-to street style fav on any given day is Alexa Chung. Charlotte Gainsbourg, her mom Jane Birkin and Brigitte Bardot are also inspiring (though I have a semi-shameful soft spot for Lauren Conrad, too). Brands I love are Kate Spade, Rebecca Minkoff, and Dior though I've only invested a little in them so far.  And for an idea of my discomfort zone, i.e. things I'm drawn to but afraid to try, see [this board](http://pinterest.com/paonecarlate/%E3%81%A0%E3%81%91%E3%81%A9-i-wanna-get-a-new-look/). **If I could boil down into a few words what I'm shooting for, they'd be: gamine, Parisienne, clean, classic, stylish.**
* **You Now:** My current style waffles between boring and sloppy. I want to look classic, but I come off ""safe,"" or I want to try something new but I just get it wrong and look messy. Things I tend to wear a lot are Gap, Madewell and Uniqlo. Before that I was all H&amp;M, F21 and *delias, so my style is evolving. I'm at a point where I'm okay investing more in my clothes. I am girly and don't dislike skirts, high heels or pretty much any article of clothing, but I tend not to wear dresses and skirts to work since most people are super casual in jeans (most people where graphic tees and jeans -- my boss wears crocs every day!). I am not into the hyper-trendy, though, like black &amp; white prison bars I've been seeing on everyone lately for example. This is mainly because I don't know how to style such trends. I want to invest in clothes that I'll wear again and again and feel comfortable in. My job is jeans-friendly so I don't have to dress business casual, but I usually try to dress up a little because I enjoy it.
* **Budget:** Low to mid-range. The highest I'm willing to go for a single article of clothing is maybe $40-$80, for a dress or something more intricate I'll happily invest $100-$300. Pretty much my limit for any one item is $300 at the moment, and usually that's a purse. I rarely splurge on one item, tending to invest a little bit in a few items in the middle range or going on a shopping binge for trends to try at at a low-end retailer like H&amp;M or F21. At the moment I'm trying to edit my warddrobe way down and only go for the essentials.
* **Location:** US, LA (Los Angeles, not Louisiana)! Good weather year-round means my outfits are very flexible and I have lots of access to major retailers. The only thing I don't really need is a lot of outerwear. However, I do travel for work a fair amount and do need clothes for that occasionally, too.

Happy to answer any more questions or post more pictures if needed, but I'm pretty verbose, so hopefully that covers it!

ETA: Guys, thank you so much!!! You're all wonderful and very, very helpful. A few things:

1. The hideous (but comfortable) American Eagle booties are officially retired. They'll be replaced by an ankle boot with a slimmer fit up top. It's clear the look I thought I was doing with those is not coming off as intended or working.
2. Sorry about the ugly sneakers in a couple of the outfits. I work about 5-6 work events a year so I'm torn on whether or not to even bother with dressing up for those things.
3. Oh my god FIT!! I had no idea that the fit of my clothes was even a problem, but it seems SO obvious to me now. I'll study up on fit and look into getting some of these things tailored. What can't be tailored will be replaced by similar pieces from a petite line.
4. Jeans! Ugh. I'll keep looking for better fitting jeans that don't sag in the knee.

"How to still dress in ""my style"" without making my husband look like a pedophile","While joking, I'm also completely serious. I look about 6-10+ years younger than I actually am, which I know will hopefully be great when I'm in my 40s &amp; 50s (like my mother who has been mistaken as a 20-something sister on multiple occasions), but right now it sucks. My poor husband gets dirty looks as we're walking down the street holding hands because I don't look like I'm in my 20s like him, but in my teens and I feel like my fashion style isn't helping.

"Hi /r/FFA, I really need your help for a very rare and very special date night","
I met my wife when I was fifteen, way back in 1991.  We married in 1993, and we've had a rollercoaster life since then with fantastic highs and crushing disappointments; she's stood by me through many difficult circumstances, and staggers me with the depth of her devotion to me and our family.  We have four wonderful children.  I work away from home midweek, every week, and she's effectively a single parent in that time.  You can't imagine how much I love her and appreciate her, and I know it takes more than just big romantic gestures to keep a marriage strong - but after a huge amount of logistical planning, I'm making that kind of gesture :-) We'll be having out first night away alone together in about fifteen years next month.  She hasn't got a clue, and it needs to stay that way because - although all the logistics are taken care of - she's a worrier, and if she finds out before it's a *fait accompli*, then it'll all come to nothing.   

So, what's all this to you, other than a nice story?  Well, part of this special night involves a stay in a 5-star hotel and an evening mostly in the open air.  She'll need three outfits as I see it, and I don't think she has anything remotely suitable for any of them: firstly, something to wear to travel in (2 hour train journey, first class) and arrive comfortably at the hotel without feeling underdressed.  Secondly, something drop-dead gorgeous to wear to dinner, followed by a short walk to an open-air event that lasts about two hours - this is ~~Spar~~ London, so we need to be prepared for it being a bit chilly (I thought perhaps some sort of shawl to wear over the dress? But maybe a coat? She needs shoes as well for this outfit).  Finally, she needs something to wear the next day for the journey home, leaving the hotel again without feeling under or over dressed.  I'm looking for some kind of pretense or excuse for her to choose these, but I don't want her to cotton on and force the truth out of me - we're not good at keeping secrets from each other - so if I can just present these outfits to her at the reveal and the inevitable ""but what will I wear?!?!"" question, that might be best.  I know it's a bit of a risk though.

So... she is 5' 9"", about 140lbs, 38 years old.  Body shape sites give either hourglass or straight results from my estimates of her current measurements - the only one I know for sure is bra size recently measured at 36F, and UK Size 14 for clothes, sometimes 12's fit.  I can spend up to about £350 on these outfits.  It would upset her if I posted a picture so I can't do that I'm afraid.  She has long brown hair, greying.  Her usual clothes are practical rather than dressy, as a busy mum-of-four - jeans and jumpers usually - but she often wears a dress to church so she won't feel totally out of place in one.  She never usually wears make-up; but her smile lights up the room.

I'd really appreciate any advice about these outfits because I want everything to be perfect for her; can you help, /r/FFA?

I'm a style train wreck. Help me replenish my closet and start over!,"Hi FFA! I'm in a terrible clothing and style rut and have been doing my darnedest to get out of it to no avail. I'm hoping you guys can help, hopefully you're up for a challenge! 

Prepare for wall of text.

Here it goes:

I started a new job and am going to need clothing that can work for both work and school since I'll be going to work right after class a lot of the time. The dress code at work is ""business casual"" but most people wear whatever they want (jeans are fine). I like to look polished but not too dressed up because comfort is important too. Seems simple enough, right? Wrong. I can't find clothing that fits! Not even shoes! 
I'm down to one pair of jeans that are too big that I've been making work out of desperation, a few boring tops, and several black jersey knit dresses. I have like 4 pairs of shoes and they are about to wear out from being worn so much (I walk a lot)  


I have no style at this point--my ""style"" has become a matter of ""whatever fits today"" and I hate it. I've been shopping almost every day for the past month and have tried on so much stuff with hardly any luck.  An H&amp;M size 2 typically fits me but I really have trouble picking out wearable pieces from there and their jeans don't come anywhere near fitting.


On top of my sizing issues, I have to cover my arms and legs (tights are fine) because I have a skin condition that I like to keep covered, and the office is very cold. I also am really frustrated that a lot of styles out right now are sheer because I don't know how to wear them modestly. Another preference: in terms of shoes, I do not want to wear anything open toed or anything that shows a lot of my foot. 


I desperately need help figuring out what my personal style is AND getting some basic pieces (at the very least). 




I've determined that I REALLY need the following: 



-Jeans. I prefer skinny jeans but not jegging type jeans in a dark or medium wash. I have a big butt/hips for my waist size and short legs so that's always a challenge.

-White cardigan/assorted cardigans.

-Jackets and blazers galore.

-Shoes--nude heels? Flats? Pretty much any shoes that will fit.
 
-Classy dresses and quality tights.






Here are my measurements: 

I'm an hourglass according to the calculator, but some days I think I wear things that make me look more pear shaped...I'd like to avoid that and show off my best assets, my butt and waist.


Waist: 21""

Hips: 30""

Bust: 30""--though I wear a push up most of the time to help make things fit better. With a push up my bust measurement is about  33"" or 34""

Under Bust: 26""

Inseam: about 26"" (short legs)

Height: 5'2 

Shoes- 5.5 or smaller. 







Where can I shop (NOT H&amp;M and preferably not online since its so difficult to find stuff that fits I don't want to be returning stuff all the time)?
What styles can I wear? 
Could you guys point me in the right direction or am I S.O.L?

Blue Line safety at night,"Hi everyone, 

Hoping to get some non-snarky responses. I live in the city, take the CTA frequently, and have evening plans in Oak Park.

To the guys watching the woman being assaulted last night,"When somebody yells at you to call the cops, CALL THE COPS.

My friend was assaulted and robbed in the loop (Van Buren near Michigan) last night by a group of black teenagers, both boys and girls. They kept asking her, ""What are you going to do about it?"" while hitting her in the face and head trying to take her backpack.

Fortunately, she thought she could do something about it, because there were two men across the street and she called out to them for help and to call the cops.

Unfortunately, they stood there and did nothing.

I know the psychology behind asking for help in a crowd is disappointing, but if you see something stop being a mindless pedestrian and do something about it. You don't have to be a hero, but calling the cops can help.

Edit: Friend is shook up with bruises and bumps, but ok. Thanks for asking. I'm sure she'll read this post and appreciate your concerns.

Longshot -thank you Kedvale/Milwaukee stranger for helping puking woman on street last summer,"Tried on FB last year but didn't get traction. Figured I'll try here.

Thank you, dude walking his dog around Kedvale and Milwaukee last summer who called 911 for a puking woman at the bus stop! You very likely saved my life, and I hope you know you're the kind of person who makes this city great.

Background, I had 2 drinks at a nearby bar, but left early after being harassed by some asshole who refused to take ""I'm not interested, I'm here for the music, please leave me alone"" as an answer. Thought being fat, ugly, and clearly queer would keep those kinds of dudes away, but alas.

I started walking home, began feeling dizzy, disoriented, and uncontrollably sick, ended up collapsing at the Milwaukee/Kedvale bus stop. I was in and out of consciousness, puking non-stop, and couldn't even work my phone. Several people walked right past me, I was sure I was going to fully pass out and choke to death.

I didn’t think I’d live to 18,"I grew up on the southwest side of Chicago.  When people ask where I come from, I mention the one landmark that immediately comes to mind: the statue of an Indian on the corner of Pulaski and 63rd St. You can see the Indian statue in the movie ‘Wayne’s World’ when Wayne, Garth, and the boys go out on the town, which I always thought was weird since Wayne lived in Aurora (were Wayne and Garth guilty of stolen Chicago valor?).  I also tell people I grew up just outside Marquette Park, which I guess is somewhat famous as Dr. Martin Luther King once led a march through the park and was met with violent opposition.  I also heard that they used to hang black people from the trees in that park, but I was never able to confirm if that was true or not.

I grew up in the 90s and what used to be a neighborhood full of Irish and Italians was almost entirely Mexican. My parents came to the United States from Mexico and though it seems like several lifetimes ago, Spanish was my first language.  I learned to speak English mostly from television (and if we are going to be even more specific, mostly from The Simpsons – a show that still holds a very special place in my heart) as no one in my household spoke a lick of English.  My father provided for my family the best he could working construction and I had a pretty wonderful childhood.  I’d constantly go to the movies with my dad, loved to surf the early web on the family computer, and all-in-all lived a pretty normal life as a kid. 

Outside the home, however, things weren’t so nice.  Gangs were inescapable. Gangbangers have no problem picking on kids walking to school and fights were a regular occurrence.  In their defense, I remember most of those fights being relatively “clean.”  I don’t remember knives, or bats, or guns ever being used during one-on-one fights.  There’d be a violent clash, spectators formed a circle around the combatants, one guy got the better of another, and sometimes the bloody, beaten guy offered his hand, the two shook, and the fight was over.  That was nice, in its own way.  The way men would resolve issues.  There was a primitive decorum that I found respectable.

But it didn’t always end like that.  Not by a long shot.

It was a scorching hot summer day in the break between 7th and 8th grade.  All I really remember about the day itself is that I was enjoying a delicious Sonic the Hedgehog ice cream bar – the kind with gumballs for eyes – and I remember the sun was so oppressive, the heat so all-consuming that poor Sonic was halfway melted a minute after I unwrapped him.  I remember how delicious that blue ice cream tasted, how refreshing the cool ice cream felt as I sat on my front steps.  It was a simpler time when I didn’t need to drink, didn’t need to smoke, didn’t need anything else to keep me content other than that ice cream bar.  That moment encapsulates my innocence.  That would be the day I lost a bit of that innocence.

The sun was beginning to set that day, and as the shadow of night began to envelop the neighborhood, there was an electricity in the air.  It was palpable.  I could almost taste it as well as I tasted that ice cream.  But I didn’t know what was causing it; no one in my family did. But we could all feel it.  We walked from our backyard to the front, and we saw people walking toward my school, which was just a few blocks behind our house.  It was as though something pulled us, and I imagine this is what the rats would feel behind the Pied Piper. So, we followed.

My school was enormous.  It taught children from kindergarten to 8th grade and spanned an entire city block.  It can best be described as a prison mixed with a castle.  We saw the tall, gray walls of my prison come as we drew near and saw that people went to the left side of the building. That side was where the younger kids usually lined up.  It was summer, of course, and even if it wasn’t there wouldn’t be any kids there as it was later in the evening.  No one, really, should have been there at that time of day and that time of year.

We arrived at the corner of the school and we saw one or two police cars.  As I drew near, my eyes scanned all over for what the commotion was about.  The scene was quiet and, at the risk of sounding trite, too quiet.  Then I saw it: at the feet of the police officers was a bicycle that was half-covered with a blanket and by the powers of inference, I knew exactly what was being covered up.  I was pretty close, we all were, and what struck me was how casual the police officers were acting.  Just another day at the office.  Cool as cucumbers, they were.  All things considered, everyone there was acting pretty calm and collected. For a bit.

A car parks on the other side of the street and a man and women came out of the car.  At the time, they looked older but that was from the perception of a kid.  Now that I think of it, those people couldn’t have been more than 40 to 45.  The officers took the couple to the body and lifted the cover.  And then I heard it.  A sound that has stayed with me for 30 years.  The wails of a woman who is looking at her son who was shot dead in the street.  There was a pain in her voice that I felt.  It is a pain that I still feel today.  The father cried too, and I can still hear his echoes, but it is the mother’s cries that cleaved themselves and left an imprint in my mind. 

And then the brother showed up.  He must have been in high school, and he was pretty obviously a banger.  He wasn’t a banger in the shaved head kind of way but in the hair slicked back style, but he had that same aura of bangers that I knew only all too well.  His sorrow erupted but where his parent’s pain was pure sadness and grief, the brother’s was an unrelenting anger, a bloodlust he bellowed out in a growl.  He slammed his fists against the police vehicle and dropped his head.  In any other circumstance, the officers would have reprimanded him for hitting the cruiser, but the calm and collected officers knew better that day.  The dent the kid caused on the cruiser paled in comparison to what this family was going through.

And here we were, the crowd spectators, gawking as if this had anything to do with us.  The show was over, so to speak, and we went back home.  The funny thing is I was there my mom, my dad, my sister, but I don’t remember there being any kind of speech, any kind of lesson to be taken from what we just saw.  What would the lesson be?  Don’t ride your bike around the neighborhood?  Be bulletproof?  I think we just kind of acted as if we saw a play and decided it was best to just move along with our lives.",chicago,769,1737211292.0,75,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1i48xhr/i_didnt_think_id_live_to_18/
UPDATE: Electrified sidewalk in Lincoln Park/Lakeview — NOT resolved!! Need help,"LOCATION: The concrete sidewalk in front of Matisse Tavern and Half Shell, across from Trader Joe’s. Corner of Diversey and Orchard.

TLDR: dogs are still at risk of being electrocuted by the sidewalk on this corner, but the Alderman’s office refuses to block off the sidewalk or investigate any further until another injury occurs. New snow just fell that could cause the sidewalk to begin conducting again, leaving all dogs at risk walking by. Contact 44th alderman to let them know this should be investigated until it’s solved. 


Making this new post because my last one lost engagement and this is very much still a massive issue. The problem remains, so do not walk your dogs there. There’s a previous post on this sub from a couple days ago if you don’t know about this issue already. 

I’ve weirdly put myself in the middle of this because I’m so disappointed by how this has been handled. I’m frustrated to say the least, mostly at the Alderman’s office for their unwillingness to continue investigating.

I’ve been in contact with a lot of people in the last 24 hours (news stations, workers at the Alderman’s office, utility personnel, etc.) to get a resolution here so we can all feel safe on that corner again, especially with our dogs. 

Here’s where we’re at. The Alderman’s office has had 4 different electricians come out to look at the sidewalk. They’ve found nothing wrong, so the Alderman’s office considers the problem “resolved” and has no plans to investigate further… even though they never identified an issue. Apparently electrical problems magically solve themselves now! I can’t wrap my head about a problem being “resolved” without ever doing anything to fix it or identifying anything causing it in the first place. That literally doesn’t make sense. Let’s remember that at least 5 dogs have been electrocuted (excuse me— they’ve been shocked. Some awesome intellectuals in the comments care more about my word choice than the issue at hand.). 

I’ve done extensive research on this to make sense of what happened. From what I can tell, in these fairly common scenarios, there can be issues with frayed wires underground (possibly wires from old infrastructure that no longer exists, although the wires remain live) that usually aren’t an issue - until the sidewalk becomes wet and salty (salt makes water more conductive). So when the electricians were checking it out, I believe the sidewalk was not electrified because the ground was more dry, and they may have missed the problem. 

The sidewalk is completely open and there are no warning signs that this could still be an issue. Nothing stopping this from happening again. I believe there is very much still an issue, it may just be dormant right now. Although a fresh layer of snow just fell, so it could start conducting electricity again. 

I’ve been in contact with the Alderman’s office and they refuse to block the sidewalk or pursue any other action - until there’s another injury. With snow falling tonight and salt reappearing on the sidewalks soon, I think it’s only a matter of time before another dog is electrocuted. (Shocked) 

Someone also said on my last post that this happened to their dog LAST WINTER on this SAME CORNER. This issue is not going anywhere until we know why it’s happening. 

Here’s what we need:
- Contact the alderman’s office. PLEASE. 44th ward. So far they’re only willing to help when a news station is involved. Alderman Tunney said on a news broadcast last night that they would be out there until they got to the bottom of it. As soon as the cameras packed up, they did too! And now his office refuses to investigate further. Let them know that this is a public safety hazard until a cause is identified. Until then, the sidewalk should be blocked to protect our pets and neighbors. Email: ward44@cityofchicago.org and Phone: 773-525-6034
- Alert other dog owners. Seriously, even if you just see dog owners around that area on the street, tell them not to walk their dog there! Trust me, you don’t want this happening again. It’s worth approaching a stranger to give them a heads up. 
- In general, try to use pet friendly ice melt! It doesn’t hurt dog’s paws and it also does not act as a conductor the same way regular rock salt does!! So if issues like this happen anywhere else, it’s less likely to cause serious damage to the dog. 
- If you ever see a dog in extreme distress on sidewalk conditions like these, drag them away from the area. We weren’t sure what was happening at the time, so we kept the dog there on the sidewalk, not knowing the sidewalk was shocking her. This needs to be a more well known issue! 

Please help us to get this resolved and protect our neighborhood pets. I really don’t want to be afraid of seeing a dog electrocuted every time I have to go to Trader Joe’s. I truly cannot believe the Alderman is wiping his hands clean of this without identifying a cause.",chicago,535,1642213223.0,194,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/s49c30/update_electrified_sidewalk_in_lincoln/
Just some Friday night staff harassment at Monk's Pub,"We were at Monk's on Friday around 9:30. A group was leaving and the man babies of the group started to harass their female server. Like finger point in her face, hovering over her, following around, yelling at her - that kind. The ring leader towered over her and kept screaming at pointing. There were a number of men surrounding one woman. This woman handled it like a pro. Stood her ground and put these drunk idiots in their place. The tall, dark haired guy walked out and his idiot minions followed but the shortest dude in the group (had a beard) decided it was his turn and called her a ""russian whore"" or something uncreative. This dude was sadder to watch because he need a booster to look her in the eye. He decided to skip out on his bill so she had to chase him into the street. There were some women in this group that stood by these men as they harassed her.

This woman handled these fools alone - all other staff stayed far away and only came to assist her after these petulant man babies left. One male staff with tats on his arms stayed talked with her but let her run outside alone when she had to chase down the bearded troll.

This woman is a pro but I hope she finds another job. She was left with no support from her managers or any other staff.  No one around to deescalate or kick these fools out. She is an absolute badass but does not deserve to be harassed. ",chicago,468,1694443656.0,128,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/16fx79v/just_some_friday_night_staff_harassment_at_monks/

I thought I would be able to get at least a little sleep tonight,  because I slept so little last night, but the noise is just driving me more crazy . I'm hoping a female will put me up for the night? I'm not a weirdo or untrustworthy in any sense.

How to deal with harassment in public?,"I’m a woman in my early 20s and been living in Chicago for a little over a year, and I’ve gotten to using the CTA basically all the time - I love the city and appreciate the CTA, but I’ve been getting harassed by random people on the street very frequently as of late. I’ve had someone wish death upon my loved ones, someone make racially charged comments at me and refuse to leave me alone on the train platform, and someone try to hold my hand on the CTA. I’ve also had people make crude comments about my body. All in the last two weeks.

I already walk with purpose, avoid eye contact, ignore people as much as I can, but it still feels like I’m being bothered at least a couple times a week. 

Anyone have tips on how to deal with this or ways to be prepared for potential escalation (pepper spray, etc.)? I understand people are sometimes mentally unwell, and while I have empathy for them, it’s really been making me disillusioned on a day to day basis.

Thank you in advance!

Edited to add: This is NOT meant to be a bandwagon for hating unhoused people - I’ve also had random (not visibly unhoused) men come up to me to ask me for my name and number and refuse to leave me alone. I don’t want to conflate the issue I’m asking about with the narrative that unhoused people are horrible and dangerous.

My thoughts moving to Dallas from Chicago,"I made a similar post on the Dallas sub and thought it would be fair to post here to share my thoughts for those considering a move to Dallas or to reinforce your decision to not move to Dallas. I grew up in the Southeast, ended up in the Midwest for school, then landed a job in Chicago after college and ended up calling Chicago my home for over a decade.

COVID really changed my view towards living in a city environment and changed my life preferences. I decided I wanted a bigger place to live that's more quiet and getting that in the city would be hard. I thought about moving to the suburbs but I figured if I was going to live in a suburban environment, why not move somewhere warmer and a bit lower cost (many Chicagoland suburbs are really expensive for housing). I applied at some jobs in Arizona, New Mexico, Florida and ended up getting a job in Dallas.

**Transportation:** Public transit in Chicago is really good and in most cases, as long as you live on the north side, you shouldn't need a car. I always lived on the south side, so my partner and I shared a car. One issue we did have with CTA, especially on the south side was safety. My ex was assaulted, both physically and verbally many times. I will say that driving in Dallas is much easier and more efficient than in Chicago. In the DFW area, as long as it's not rush hour and you just want to run a few errands, a 5 mile trip will take you no more than 10min. In short, I find it easier to do tasks on the weekends in Dallas. Going to Costco, grocery store, clothing shopping, lunch out, and Home Depot can be done in just a few hours.

**Safety:** This is the one thing Chicago is notorious for. Of course we all know that Fox News greatly over exaggerates the crime in Chicago, but we also know that there is a bit of truth to it. Everyone I know in Chicago has been involved in some sort of crime or ""sketchy stuff"" at some point in their lives. In Dallas the crime is concentrated around bad neighborhoods or happens at night in popular nightlife districts but it doesn't spill over into other areas. Statistics may say one thing but my partner says she ""feels"" significantly safer in the Dallas area compared to Chicago. At least once a week she felt uneasy on CTA or walking around the Loop after work when it's dark in winter.

**Employment opportunities:** Both Dallas and Chicago have great job opportunities and I find the salaries between the two to be very similar. One thing I liked about finding jobs in Chicago is that they were almost always in the Loop or close to the Loop so I didn't have to worry about moving after getting a new job. One thing about Dallas is that jobs are spread out all over rather than centralized to a downtown area. This can be a blessing and a curse depending on how you frame it. People who want to live in the suburbs and live 10min from work will love it. But the issue is that if you switch jobs, you have to be strategic as to where the job is to avoid a long commute. At least in Chicago with most jobs being downtown, you already know how your commute will be.

**Entertainment:** For such a large metro area, Dallas is incredibly boring to me. All of the Dallas natives say there are plenty of things to do, but it's not on the same level as Chicago. Dallas has museums and other cultural activities, same as Chicago, but there just really isn't a cool neighborhood vibe where you can get off the train and walk around and discover a new quirky bookstore, record shop, and find new bars. You have to actively search for things to do. But how do you know what to search for? Like for example I once found out about a Thai food festival after it happened because that's an oddly specific thing to search Google for. Another issue is that when you search for things to do in Dallas online, the majority of them are in the suburbs and those events always are more family oriented. As you can imagine, a taco festival in Pilsen will have a different vibe than taco festival in Schaumburg. 

**Bar scene:** One of the best parts of Chicago is the unique bar scene. Every neighborhood has bars that cater to different types of people. Dallas only has a few nightlife areas and most are just a single street with restaurants that also happen to serve drinks. I went to a ""bar"" that was highly recommended by locals and was so confused when I entered. It was literally a restaurant that just happened to have a bar serving drinks.

**Out of town trips:** In Chicago I really liked heading over to the Michigan beaches, Milwaukee for the day, or Wisconsin for some outdoor fun. In Dallas there really isn't a lot to do within a 2-3hr drive unless you like small Texas towns.

**Outdoor activities:** Chicago isn't the best outdoorsy city but it beats anything in Dallas which is probably one of the worst cities in the US for outdoor activities. People don't even leave their windows open because it's either too hot, too cold, or raining. I love camping and it's very hard to camp in Texas as almost all of the state is privately owned land. We don't have that many state parks and the ones closest to metro areas are always full on the weekends. 

**Politics:** For me this is a wash. If you are more left leaning, Texas is one of the worst states to live in because of how overly vocal and conservative the state officials are. But I wouldn't say that Chicago politics are any less toxic.

**People:** We always hear negative things about Texas on the news but I don't think that represents people who live here. I always find Texans to be very friendly and nice.

**Race relations:** This one is so awkward to discuss but it's something I noticed almost immediately after moving to Dallas. Chicago is a very segregated city and black, white, Hispanic, and Asian people seem to live totally separate lives. And the interactions between races, especially between black and white people felt very constrained. For some reason, I felt like black people in Chicago were hostile to non-black people and many non-black people were uncomfortable being around black people. In Dallas, I witness no such awkwardness. 

**Food:** The Chicago food scene is in general, better than Dallas but there are some areas where Dallas comes ahead. BBQ and Asian food is better quality and more readily available in Dallas. And surprisingly I find the tacos to be better in Chicago. In Dallas, most of the taco places are more TexMex and finding a taco place that's similar to Mexico City style isn't easy.

I think Dallas is a great place to live to further your career and we still have relatively low cost of living compared to other large metro areas. There are a lot of Chicagoland natives who have moved down this way and usually it's for lower COL and weather and just a more laid back lifestyle. I think the DFW metro area is a great place to buy a home and raise a family but may be lacking for people who aren't interested in this.",chicago,0,1715187046.0,135,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1cn9d8s/my_thoughts_moving_to_dallas_from_chicago/
Pro tip for folks using Uber in the loop from an Uber driver,"if you are getting an Uber pickup in the loop, PLEASE type in the address rather than using your location on your phone. GPS and phone location in the loop are wildly inaccurate due to the tall buildings. Typically 1 out of three pick ups I get in the loop is off by anywhere from 1 to 4 blocks because people used their location on their phone. This affects navigation as well: much of the loop completely negates GPS satellites and our position on the map either wanders through buildings or the screen will just spin continuously. As a result, if you are watching our location you can see us all over the place in a matter of moments. 

Just a tip to make the whole process easier. Last night I get a pickup at 111 Wacker, wait 5 minutes and the woman calls me saying shes at Adams and Franklin. She gets mad that in traffic it takes me 5 minutes of one way streets to get her and cancels when Im almost there. This is a nightly scenario so save yourself some aggravation and look for an address to use. Youll get picked up faster and everyone will be less frustrated. =8)",chicago,486,1463154025.0,121,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/4j6we7/pro_tip_for_folks_using_uber_in_the_loop_from_an/

Some ideas about riding bikes in Chicago,"Last year, I posted here about my first day out on a bike that season and how much I struggled to avoid cars coming right up on me. It was surprising how many cars were angry, honking, irritated, nearly hitting me all the time, now matter how much I tried to hug the curb. Someone suggested I was being tooooo conservative, and ""owning the space I need"" might be a stronger approach to letting other drivers know what I was doing.

Since then, I've adopted a few tactics and today's ride seems so much smoother than my first ride last year. I thought I'd share my strategies here in case you have any thoughts. (but please be kind, I know some people hate all bikers, full stop, and that's not what I'm talking about).

One. Awareness

* Be super aware of the right of way, lights, cars behind or in front of you, potholes, and more. Try your best to see which parked cars may have someone in the front seat about to open a door. This is probably common sense to 90% of cyclists, but it's a good place to start.
* Be careful with music. You need to be able to hear if a car is riding up on you.

Two. Dialogue.

* Make it as clear as possible where you are going. Indicate often. Some people don't know the official biking signals, so I just point directly to the path I'm taking -- I point to turn left, I point to turn right, I point straight to let cars know at a 4 way stop sign that I want to go straight. I find people are much more generous when they know what I'm trying to do.
* Use the midwest wave. Whether driving or walking or cycling, the midwest wave is a great way to say ""thanks for letting me pass"" or ""sorry I didn't see you were turning left"" and it lets the other person know you weren't trying to be an asshole. That can go a LONG way with drivers.
* Some people are just assholes, and there's nothing you can do about that. Just try your best.

Three. Use the bike lanes and bike routes

* I will go out of my way to use the North Shore Trail or 606 or other bike-specific routes. No risk of colliding with cars. Still need to be careful to share the roads with pedestrians etc, but less likely to end up with a broken arm... or worse.
* Some roads don't have bike lanes and they are just so awful. Fullerton is terrible for bikers. I try to use side streets instead.  

Four. Leave your ego at home

* This should really go for drivers, too, but I'm here for cyclists. The fact is, when playing ""right of way chicken"" with a car, the cyclist is going to lose. We might have the right of way, but if a driver is plowing towards us, we have to get out of the way or we're going to be seriously injured.

Five. Safety, safety, safety

* Wear a helmet. Make sure it's a good one that fits properly. I've shared before the story of my friend whose head was literally run over by a semi after knocking him off his bike. His well-fitted helmet saved his head from popping like a watermelon. He's a medical physicist now. He could be dead. Wear a helmet.
* Think about your clothes! I'm surprised to see a lot of people wearing black when they ride. That might be fine during the day, but I've seen moving shadows at night only to realize -- oh wow, that's a person in all black! I nearly didn't see them. 
* Consider reflectors. On your bike, on your helmet, on your bag, on your clothing. A blinking light can also make sure you are see amidst the brights of a car at night (which only seem to get brighter as years go on, blinding everyone).

I'm sure we could go on and on with good tips, but I think the communication point is a great one. When someone is parked in the bike lane and I have to change lanes to go around them, pointing where I am going nearly always leads to a car slowing down, letting me pass, and then they go past me and I give them the midwest wave to say thanks. It's made my city biking so much nicer and I hope maybe these tips will make your biking nicer too!

A Very Reddit New Year's Eve Party,"I met a guy at the Christmas party last night, and it turned out we were both refugees from Digg (no real shock there).  I remarked to him that the biggest difference that I noticed between Digg and Reddit was the striking contrast between the user communities.  People on Reddit just seemed more *polite*.  It was based on that reason alone that, after a mere three months on Reddit, I felt comfortable enough to invite all y'all strangers over to my place last year for a New Year's Eve party.

Well, it's that time of year again, and I'm really looking forward to throwing another party.  Of course, it will not be a huge bash like the two concerts over the summer.  It'll be a return to the original format: **no cover charge, dress in your Sunday best, BYOB, and if you can bring food, that would be great.**

My apartment is located at Diversey/Western/Elston - it'll be hard to miss with the neon Reddit alien in the window.  However, **if you want to RSVP, please shoot me an email at greeneggsandham4@hotmail.com.  Even if you know where I live, please RSVP anyway** so I know who all is coming. :-)  I'll send out exact address info to those who RSVP.

Obviously, it'll be on Dec. 31st, starting around 7-ish or 8-ish, whenever, and going until 2-ish or 3-ish, whenever.  The 76 bus stops right outside my door, the 49 bus is mere steps down the street, and the blue/red/brown/purple lines are easily accessible.  There's also lots of free on-street parking, and carpooling is highly encouraged.

**EDIT 12/10:**  Also, please include your reddit nickname in your RSVP.  Theeeeeenks.

**EDIT 12/11:** If I don't send you a personal response to your RSVP, don't worry - I got it.  I'll send out detailed address info a couple of days before the party to everyone.

**EDIT 12/27:** Trees are welcome, but will be sequestered to the basement.  Regular cigarette smoking is verboten anywhere in the house since I'm allergic to that shit!

**EDIT 12/28:** Tomorrow afternoon, I'll be sending out details to those who have RSVPd.  Email me now if you want to get on the guest list!

**EDIT 12/29:** I have sent out details just now to all those who RSVP'd.  Let me know if you didn't get the email.

Some ramblings about the CTA after having visited Toronto,"I just spent a week in Toronto and got around entirely on public transportation. I figure Toronto is a good system to compare with the CTA given that the cities in general have a lot in common and are of comparable sizes.

To preface, this isn't just another one of those ""THE CTA SUCKS!!!"" posts, it's me trying to genuinely and in good faith perform a comparison with another similar city. Also this is my impression from one week mainly traveling to tourist destinations in Toronto, not what the average person would be experiencing if they lived there.

* Coverage: The L wins in coverage - the Toronto Subway currently has four lines, and two of them are very short (similar to the Purple and Yellow Lines). 48 route-miles and 75 stations in Toronto vs. 103 route-miles and 145 stations on the L. They are opening Line 5 in Toronto fairly soon which will add another east-west corridor, but the L will still offer significantly better coverage.
* Frequency: Lines 1 and 2 (the main ones) in Toronto both operate with very high frequencies, as frequent as every 2-3 minutes during rush hour, and even during off-peak hours every 5 minutes or so. Even ignoring the current staffing issues, most L lines aren't scheduled to run that frequently, especially not during off-peak hours.
* Layout: The Toronto Subway is similarly hub-and-spoke as the L is. While there isn't a singular focal point analogous to the Loop, there is a circuit bounded by Line 2 between St. George and Yonge and Line 1 making a U shape between those two stations, and four legs branching out from that circuit. They are opening a new east-west light rail line further north relatively soon, which will allow easier travel around the city not via downtown, and I guess the closest analogue to that would be opening an L line along Western or Kedzie or something like that (which I would absolutely love to see happen sometime).
* Elevated vs. underground: The Toronto Subway is almost entirely underground. I imagine this is very nice in the winter, and the heat lamps on the L only help so much (not to mention the wind). It also cuts down on noise from the surface and people living near the tracks (though you can definitely still hear trains from the street). On the other hand, the L being mostly elevated helps you get your bearings for where you are while you travel so you have a better idea of where you are, and of course offers a more interesting ride.
* Cleanliness: Take this with a grain of salt since I was mostly in the downtown area that they probably do more to maintain and probably have some ""grass is greener"" bias here, but the Toronto Subway felt cleaner both on trains in stations. I saw minimal trash out and generally the platforms and trains felt well-maintained. I do hope the CTA ups its game with regards to keeping stations and trains clean.
* Safety: I never rode in Toronto at late nights, and really have never felt unsafe on the L during the day. However there was one case where my train stopped and then bypassed a stop due to a ""security incident"" at Bloor-Yonge.
* Train design: Lines 1 and 4 operate open-gangway trains which are really nice since you can more easily find a less-crowded part of the train. The railcars are also a lot longer and wider than the L cars (75x10 ft in Toronto vs. 48x9 ft in Chicago). I would love to see open-gangway trains in Chicago someday, but I know operating wider/longer railcars isn't really possible due to the platform width and the sharp curves.
* Buses: The TTC bus system (in my *very* limited experience on it in Toronto) felt pretty similar to the CTA buses, but of course I wasn't really relying on it.
* Streetcars: There was a post here a while back lamenting the loss of Chicago's once-large streetcar network. I took the Toronto streetcars a number of times, and other than the ones that operate in reserved medians they are unbelievably slow, probably slower than buses. They also don't have particularly good acceleration, especially uphill. They have more space but are really slow. Also there were some diversions due to construction, and the track layout offers a lot less flexibility in rerouting than it would with a bus. In general I think most of the former streetcar lines are better off as buses, and if we ever do add any new ones they would only work on very high-traffic corridors and need to be in a reserved median with traffic signal priority.
* Airport access: Toronto wins this one by a lot. They have the Union-Pearson Express which for  about CA$10 is able to get me from downtown to the airport 14 miles away (comparable to the distance from downtown Chicago to O'Hare) in 25 minutes, compared to 45-60 on the Blue Line. It mostly runs along GO Transit (commuter rail) tracks, with a spur for the airport and a special platform at Union Station. It would be awesome if we could run some equivalent service to O'Hare via the NCS tracks since the Metra station is now on the ATS, but I know that track is owned by a freight company who doesn't really want more Metra trains running there.
* Commuter rail: Their GO Transit system in general has more frequent service than Metra, and collects fares off-board using a proof-of-payment system (tap your card before boarding and after getting off, and they do random fare inspections). This allows boarding all cars at all stations which is really nice. Toronto Union Station is also a through station, so a lot of inbound trains will just make a brief stop at Union Station and then continue running outbound along another line. The big difference is Toronto is part of the Golden Horseshoe with a number of fairly large cities, while Chicago is (relatively) isolated, so most traffic in Chicago is headed from the suburbs to the city, while in Toronto I would imagine there is a good amount of traffic to places like Mississauga.

How safe is Avondale?,"I have searched this sub and other forums for info, but most comments are a few years old so I figured it's safe if I ask again. Apologies if I missed a recent post about this topic!

My boyfriend and I are seriously considering moving to Avondale from Lincoln Park. We're drawn to the neighborhood because we'll be getting waaaay more bang for our buck, public transportation seems accessible, and many of our favorite restaurants are nearby.

The main ""question mark"" in my mind is the safety of the area. I am a 26 y/o woman who will be walking about .4 mi to the Belmont blue line stop to commute downtown.

Details on the location: South of Barry; East of Central Cark/Milwaukee ave intersection; North of Diversey.

When we toured the place, it seemed to be a quiet residential street, with families on either side. Detached garage parking for my boyfriend's car and a fenced in yard for our dog are big selling points to us. The unit is on the first floor so any tips on home security systems are also welcome.

Maybe I'm being totally irrational, but I've been reading as much as I can about the area since I've been in LP for 4 years and have mixed feelings. Like I mentioned, a lot of the ""negative"" comments about crime, gang activity, etc. are anywhere from 4-10 years old at this point.

What's the right way to deal with pushy beggars?,"I had kind a kind of freaky incident yesterday night at about 9:30PM. I was walking west on Chicago towards the brown line stop at Franklin (by myself; and by the way I am male). There's a poorly-lit stretch between Dearborn and Clark, and there were about four guys just standing there in the darkness talking to each other.  As I walked past, a couple of them asked me for money. I said ""I'm sorry, I can't help you"" and kept walking.

One of them kept walking with me and tried to shake my hand. I tried to ignore him and just keep walking, but he kept following me, and started talking about how rude it was to not shake someone's hand. (I know full well that trying to shake strangers' hands on the street is a tactic used almost exclusively by people who want to engage you when you have no interest in engaging them, and in the circumstances I felt like it was also a bit threatening.) He followed me for probably a block like this, until I eventually apologized for not shaking his hand and said I was sorry but I couldn't help him out.

He turned friendlier but wouldn't stop following me. He asked my name, asked me where I was from, talked about how we as hungry, etc, etc. I kept telling him I was sorry but I couldn't help him, but he just wouldn't leave me alone. We walked a couple more blocks this way until finally I got to the brown line station. He didn't follow me up the stairs, but he stood right outside them and shouted up at me about how this was shameful. Once I was up on the platform he kept shouting that he could still see me, this is shameful, etc. Finally the train came and I left. I'm still a bit rattled, honestly.

How should I have dealt with this situation better? I want to be compassionate, and I can understand how someone who found (for whatever reason) that they had to beg money from strangers might feel, but I also don't want to put myself in danger and I don't want to encourage threatening stuff like that.",chicago,26,1339354240.0,87,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/uuw89/whats_the_right_way_to_deal_with_pushy_beggars/

Street Parking in East Village area between Augusta and Division,"I'm looking into an apartment in this area between Augusta and Division. It only comes with one parking spot though so one of us would need to do street parking. I've never done street parking in the city (have only lived here one year and had garage parking). How hard would street parking be in this area?  


It looks like a lot of the streets are free parking, which seems like it would fill up even faster than permit parking, especially being close to Division. I'm concerned mostly from a safety perspective. If I came back later at night (10pm-12am), I'd probably have to park farther away from my place and not sure how safe it would be walking back at that time. Secondarily, I've heard in winter, it can be quite annoying to find street parking...

Public Safety - Please Be Careful,"Last night I received a message from work that someone in their building had been robbed by two people in teens/early twenties wearing black ski masks. This happened in Ravenswood on 10/26 two blocks west of 4606 N. Hermitage. I clocked it but because I was in Edgewater I didn’t think too much about it.

At 2am I turned onto W Early Ave that meets Magnolia Ave in Edgewater right off of Broadway. As I turned I saw a person wearing all black, a ski mask/balaclava, riding their bike on the sidewalk, actively looking at peoples homes. I made eye contact with him while I was slowing down to find parking.

Then he slowed down and watched me. Something in me felt like this was a dangerous person and I sped up and rounded the corner. As I did that I could see them pedaling to follow me. 

I called 911 to report the suspicious activity and met up with police later who acknowledged they were trying to find this particular person/people. There were no discernible descriptions about the person other than their clothing and they seemed to carry themselves like a young person: late teens/early 20’s. That and the fact that they were actively casing peoples homes.

I could be a long shot and it could be a false alarm, but it feels like there’s more nefarious activity in the area. Please be careful, don’t walk home alone, and send a text to your friends to mark that you’re safe.",chicago,40,1698529363.0,2,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17inw0r/public_safety_please_be_careful/
Thank you CTA bus drivers,"I do believe that the bus system needs to improve, but just wanted to share the experience I had the other night.
I was waiting at the corner of 26th and Pulaski for the bus at around 12:40 am. I knew better than to be in that area so late but I didn't have a better option and I knew the 60 was coming in 15 minutes so I thought I would risk it. A few minutes after I sit down a car with it's headlights on pulls over about 20 feet back from my stop, and stays there idling. This was already super menacing, as nobody else is around and it's fairly dead in the streets. However, two minutes later they pull forward a couple feet. A couple minutes later a few more feet. It was extremely unnerving and frightening and as a woman it was hard to not imagine some disastrous scenarios. This continued for the next ten minutes, the car slowly inching closer to me. I stand up knowing that the bus is coming, and as it pulls around a building I see that it says Not In Service. My heart immediately sinks. It's a 30 minute walk from here and I will be at the mercy of whoever is in that car. I don't know if it was the look of desperation on my face, if it wasn't really out of service, or just luck but the driver pulled over, directly in front of this car at this point. I am literally on the verge of tears with relief as I get on, and thanked the driver 4 or 5 times. He was stoic and I thanked him again as I got off but I don't want to think about what might have happened if he hadn't decided to pull over for me. 
TLDR: a bus driver may have well saved my life and I'm very grateful that we have even the system that we do here, even if it should improve.",chicago,20,1700432633.0,3,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/17z8slo/thank_you_cta_bus_drivers/
Got hexed twice by the same homeless woman. Who else has this happened to??,"So, three years ago (October 19, 2012 according to Facebook) my boyfriend and I were walking in Lakeview when a homeless woman approached us to ask for money. We said no, and as we walked away she yelled after us ""I hope yo' baby dies!""... which was such a specific and bizarre thing to say under the circumstances (we don't have a baby; I wasn't pregnant or pregnant-looking at the time) that we never forgot it. For years I have joked about how this person put a hex on my firstborn, fairytale-style.

Fast forward to last Friday night: we're walking to dinner after work in River North, and a woman walks up to us across the street from the rock &amp; roll McDonald's.

""You've gotta help me out... those people wouldn't, and I'm just looking for a little help. I just need to go in there [gestures to McDonald's] and get three fish sandwiches--"" to which we were like ""THREE?""

Anyway she asked us for money, we said no, we continued walking, and then suddenly...

*""I hope you both die, I hope yo' baby dies.""*

IT WAS HER. IT WAS THE BABY-DIES LADY.

Anyway, it got me thinking, how many people has this woman put a hex on in the last three years, or in the years before that? Thousands? Anyone else in this sub? How do you feel about being hexed? Do you think my hex has been reversed now that she accidentally did it to me twice? Who *is* the baby-dies lady?",chicago,49,1439502894.0,42,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/3gwhep/got_hexed_twice_by_the_same_homeless_woman_who/
Car in Chicago?,"Hi everyone! I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice regarding transportation in Chicago. I am moving to Chicago this month as I just got into a school there, so as a student I was wondering how much I would need my car. I plan to work at the school, and don't really party/go to bars, so I would say the latest I would stay out is around 9pm. While I fully plan to take advantage of CTA, (I get a free pass as a student, weepee!) I'm still a little nervous about not having my car with me. As a young woman from a small town, who actually saw her first train when she went to Chicago... would it be wise to take my car with me? Any advice is appreciated, and can't wait to see everyone at the meetups!

**THANKS so much everyone for all you help, I'm still debating, but you all have really given great advice.

EDIT: It's probably important to note that my commute is pretty reasonable as I plan to live only 3 miles from campus, with the brown line leading directly to my school. 

EDIT2: I should say, I get free parking on my neighborhood street.

EDIT3: My main concern really isn't getting from point A to point B, it's more taking trains/buses at night. How safe is this? I kind of want my car just in case I know I'll be out late that day or something.

EDIT4!! As a part of my academic program I do a practicum which involves me going to different sites across Chicago. The professors have told me that more sites are available if I have a car, since I won't be limited to where trains can take me. While there is the metra option for the suburb area, another issue is time. If I had my car I could drive to and fro without delay and be able to make it to a class that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to attend. Practicum doesn't start till next year, so I guess my real concern now is if I should wait or just take the car now.",chicago,4,1312436084.0,53,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/j8j5y/car_in_chicago/

"As a visitor to the city, I just want to give a thank you to the quick work of your police officers last night after shots were fired near my friend's place.","Around 10:30pm we heard about 8 shots fired right outside the apartment (my friend lives in Wicker Park and was told just yesterday that there is rarely violence in the immediate vicinity of his place).  It was the first time I've heard shots fired on the street so obviously I was shaken.    

Within about a minute, sirens were screaming and we heard them coming closer.  I hopped on chicagoscanner.com and was following the scenario live.  Within about a 20 minutes your officers had multiple people in custody after they found ditched cars and weapons nearby.  I was shocked how fast they got the situation under control.  No one was injured thankfully.

After chatter about this report of shots fired came to an end, we kept listening out of curiosity and I was blown away by the dozens of dangerous situations the officers raced to over the course of just one night.  It put me at ease and allowed me to get some sleep knowing we were safe and had people looking out for our safety.  Thank you for your bravery and courage.  I highly recommend giving the police scanner a listen one evening to understand the drama and stress these officers undergo on a daily basis.

Just a reminder to stay vigilant and beware of scammers,"I feel like such a dumbass right now. I thought I've lived here long enough to avoid this type of thing but apparently not. Last night I was scammed, and there were a million red flags I should have noticed but didn't.

I was in the west loop area doing food deliveries, and a lady approached me. She was in tears and panicking, which was probably why I let my guard down. Also, I hate to admit it, but I also let my guard down because she was a young white woman, so her story seemed more believable.

She told me a story about how she lived far away, and she couldn't drive home because her friend was drunk. Red flag number one, she seemed perfectly sober so she could have driven. Also, her friend was nowhere to be seen. Nor was the taxi. 

She gave me her phone number so I could contact her, which really means nothing because she's obviously not replying to texts or calls. It was probably a throwaway number anyway. 

She said that the taxi required a cash deposit because she was traveling over thirty miles. Red flag number two, why would a taxi require cash if they accept cards?

I told her I didn't have any cash on me, which was true. She immediately pointed to the shop across the street that had an ATM sign. Red flag number three, she knew where the ATM was without hesitation.

She followed me inside, I used the ATM, of course it only gave multiples of 20, and she said the cash deposit was $65. Red flag number four, that's such an arbitrary number. And why couldn't she just withdraw the cash herself if she actually had money? Anyway, I withdrew $80 plus a $2 ATM fee. 

I gave her the cash, she said thank you, I saved her life, hugged me, the whole shebang, and I hopped on the L and we went our own ways.

The whole ordeal was FAST, so I wasn't processing things properly. I was also tired from work, plus it was dark and cold out. It wasn't until I sat down on the train and took a breath that I realized what really happened.

Moral of the story, don't be an idiot like me. Don't give money to strangers, ever, unless you're fully prepared to never get it back. Even if they're the nicest person in the worst situation, always offer to help some other way, or just don't help at all. You're not obligated to be a hero to everyone.

"Women, please be smart when you go out partying","Edited 9/13/2015 6PM in response to some comments. Added or edited text are in [brackets].

Some of the crazy things I see as rideshare driver makes me want to say this:

[Men and] women, please don't put yourselves in dangerous situations. Use wisdom! If you're going out partying or whatever, use the buddy system. Have a friend that YOU REALLY KNOW with you who will be the designated person, one who won't drink, and who will help keep you out of trouble.

Don't get wasted as a group without a designated friend. 

Having said this, no one should rape another person. [Rapists are 100% responsible for their actions. It's not the victim's fault, even if he or she is absolutely wasted.]

[Even so, men and] women shouldn't do [careless] things [such as] getting completely wasted (alone or with a group) and wander around alleys hailing every car that passes by them (I saw this Friday at 2 AM).

I'm not victim-blaming. Again, there's no excuse for rape or any other crime. [It's not the victim's fault, no matter their words, actions, or the clothes they wear.]

I'm simply asking [men and] women to use common sense, to be mindful of your surroundings, to have a designated KNOWN friend (not some stranger you just met at the bar - like one of [the passengers] I had recently), and not to get so smashed that you find yourself in an alley hailing every car in the street.

Missing or Stolen Vehicle! Please keep an eye out.,"Welp, I went to the bar alone on Monday night. To cut a long story short I had WAY too much to drink. I woke up Tuesday afternoon and, unable to find my keys, grabbed my spare car keys and took a taxi back to Belmont &amp; Sheffield to find that my car was missing.

The vehicle in question is a silver 2002 Toyota Solara, a 2-door sedan displaying the license plate 'S94 1768.' There is an ACH model military helmet with a desert camouflage cover and SWD goggles displayed in the rear windshield. The front left bumper is badly damaged and was strung together with orange zip-ties; the corner light is distinctly hanging out from its housing.

The keys are on a  Nite Ize S-biner (a la http://www.simpleoutdoorstore.com/images/nite_ize_s_biner_ahhh.jpg) and include a car key, remote, three house keys with colored bands, and an Apple iPod in an orange rubber case.

The last known location of the car and keys was Big City Tap at Belmont &amp; Sheffield sometime between 2 AM and 4 AM. The car was (at the time) legally parked in a 15-minute standing zone which cuts off at 5 PM. Since I did not return until the next day I had assumed it was towed but I have been keeping tags on Chicago's towing records and it has not come up. I filed a police report for a stolen vehicle this morning and did a walk-around of the nearby streets with no results.

If you see this vehicle please send me a message! Thank you in advance.",chicago,14,1448481714.0,28,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/3u99o2/missing_or_stolen_vehicle_please_keep_an_eye_out/
I just got robbed and I don't know what to do next.,"So I just returned to my apartment this afternoon at around 3:45pm with my front door left wide open. I live on the 3rd floor of a walk-up in a nice neighborhood in the city. Unfortunately, my apartment is located in the back of the building right next to the alleys and the train so I always lock my door, lock my windows and close my blinds when I leave my apartment.

*But what is even more unfortunate is that the fire escape leads right up to my window.* These bastards knew I wasn't home or they didn't care, either way I'm so grateful that I wasn't around. They climbed up the fire escape, opened my window,  busted the locks on it, took my stuff and ***walked right out the front door***. I know it was more than one individual because the object they stole couldn't have been carried by one person alone (roughly  113lbs).

I'm basically freaking out because crime rates are so high in this city. I've had friends robbed at gun point on the streets. What if I had been home, sleeping in the next room in the middle of the night, during the encounter with these jerkoffs? What if they decide to come back? How did they know that I even had anything worth value? I rarely even put my blinds up! and when I do, I have sheer curtains that cover up most of the window.

 It's rather nerve racking.

I don't know what steps to take next. How am I going to protect myself from the next scumbags that try to break in? I want to know in what ways I can better protect myself and my apartment from another home invasion. 

**Any insight, comments, or advice would help.** 

But please refrain from posting if you're going to be rude because I took every precaution (affordable &amp; logical) into consideration but it still happened. I want to know how I can prevent this from happening in the future because I don't plan on moving for a few years. 


TLDR; My apartment was broken into during the afternoon via fire escape and they walked out the front door with my stuff.

New to the city: Woman commuting at 5.45am -- is this a good idea?,"Hi Chicago! I have another ""should I live in this neighborhood"" question you guys love to answer -- sorry! I'm going to be working by Willis/Sears Tower for a few months (January - April) and I wanted to ask about two areas in regard to early morning safety. I'm a late 20s woman and I've found a sub-lease at N Clybourn &amp; Webster. I know Lincoln Park is generally considered safe, but I need to be at the office by 6.30am and I'm a little concerned. I've been to Chicago a few times on holiday (freaking love the city and hope to move permanently one day), but I'm not super familiar with the area and the public transportation is kind of lacking in the immediate vicinity. 

Google Maps tells me I have three options, all leaving between 5.45a-6am, total commute time 32-42 minutes:

1). Walk ~20 minutes to Armitage &amp; Sheffield and take the Brown Line to Quincy &amp; Adams. There's a Starbucks that will be open on Armitage, which makes me feel better, but there's not a whole lot of stuff between the apartment and it.

2). Walk ~6 minutes across the bridge to Ashland &amp; Webster and hop on the 9 bus. Change at Harrison &amp; Ashland (5 minute wait), drops me off right outside the office. The street view looks a bit sketchy/empty around Ashland, especically where the bus stop is. 

3). Walk ~6 to Fullerton &amp; Greenview for the 74 bus. Change at Fullerton &amp; Sheffield (5 minute wait) for the 37 bus, drops me off ~4 minutes away from the office. Fullerton &amp; Greenview has a lot more businesses, but they won't be open at that time. 

Any thoughts on which option I should take?  Will the cold weather deter a lot of potential threats? I hate running, and I really hate running when there's ice. Am I completely overthinking it? OR should I look somewhere near DePaul/Fullerton/Diversey in LP and hop on the Brown Line from there? I used to live in San Francisco with similar early hours, but I knew that city really well and which streets to avoid, etc. I've been living in ridiculously safe cities for the past few years and feel like I've lost a bit of my street-smart intuition. Any insight to soothe my neurotic and over-prepared personality is greatly appreciated. :)

Got a hit and run notice from the police. Any experience with this situation?,"Today I received a hit and run notice (that I missed in my stack of junk mail). It states that my car was involved with a hit and run. It says I have to be at 1718 S. State St today at 5:30 (why so late?). I do not drive the car but it is in my name (my girlfriend uses it to go to work). I looked up the address that was on the report and it is for an intersection a couple miles from her work but outside of her route. Her work is right off of the expressway and the report says it happened a couple miles south. The address is far from our apartment so I know its not something from the neighborhood.

Another thing, on the report, it says my license plate # and EXP of 4/2012... however if this is when my license plate expires, the actual sticker expires 12/12. 

Lastly, I called the # but the investigator will not be in until 3:30pm.

Obviously I'm stressed. I know my girlfriend is a very good person, as most of us are. If an accident occured, I know she would not flee the scene. Also, there is no damage to the car at all so I don't see how this could be accurate. Anyone have experience with this kind of situation? could it be as simple as a misreported plate? Thanks all in advance.

EDIT: One thing that stands out in the letter: ""It is a Class A Misdemeanor for anyone who willfully fails, refuses or neglects to complete a trafic crash report as required by law""... so obviously if this was a fleeing the scene kind of hit and run, they would of come to my house and arrested me right? I'm thinking this is some kind of insurance requirement that the person had to file and it became a hit and run? maybe a mirror touched or something? ugh who knows... has this happened to anyone else?

P.S. Please keep the topic on point. I dont want this turning into a 'Dude, break up with your girlfriend she is lying' thread. We are all (mostly) adults here right?

EDIT 2: I figured it out but this is a strange situation. On the day before this incident was reported, there was a snow storm. At the intersection in question, she slide and tapped the car in front of her. The woman in front of her got out of the car to inspect, said there was no damage and left the scene. My girlfriend says everything was cordial and there was no anger or anything. Total regular tiny little love tap. WTF do we do now?

EDIT 3: BTW, the date of what happened was Jan 20, the letter I got from the police says Jan 21... The letter itself was sent on Feb 9 and i received it on tuesday of this week (thought it was junk mail and didn't open it).  I called the Detective but her secretary said she was with a 'client'. If I wasn't so damn anxious I would laugh.

EDIT 4 (2/19/11):
No official charge. Just the conversation with the detective. When I called, it went well. When my GF called, she described it as being the kind of conversation you see in a detective noir movie. ""WHERE WERE YOU ON THE NIGHT OF THE 21ST OF AUGUST! WHO WERE YOU WITH"" and a lot of disbelief from the detective. Anyways, I managed to find the police report online (for a fee) and purchased it. When I read it, my jaw dropped. Complete lies AND the person apparently pulled over and called the police and got taken to the hospital complaining of back and neck pain.

Some of the statements in the police report were inaccurate. The date of the event was wrong, but the day was right. There was a statement that said my GF sped away to flee the scene, however, she waited for the other person to leave first, all this after the lady said there was no damage and drove away. Lastly, it says when she sped away from the scene, that she went further down the street, when it fact she got in the left turn lane and turned on the street. Mind you, this is ALL during a snow storm, in traffic, while everyone was going 5mph.
Also, strangely enough, the time of the police report was 1 full hour after she got off work, however the event happened less than a half mile from her work. So how would it take 1 hour to get to the intersection in question? even at 5mph during a snow storm?

In the end, if this woman wants to go after my insurance company? so be it... but hit and run? this isn't something to be lying about. We have no money... My GF makes 8 bucks an hour and goes to school full time. We are swimming in debt. Dont know what to do. The detective never called us back so I will call again tomorrow",chicago,8,1329500752.0,26,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/pu45n/got_a_hit_and_run_notice_from_the_police_any/

Hey /r/Chicago - visiting Chicago the weekend of 8/25 and curious about a Donut shop!,"Hey /r/Chicago! A group of us are visiting Chicago from Aug. 25th-29th. Certainly not my first time (it is for some of my group), and definitely not my last. We all want to explore areas of the city other than the Loop/River North (where I've always spent most of my time in the city on prior trips), night life, restaurants, breweries, etc. I've already looked at ""What to do in Chicago"" in the sidebar for some ideas and definitely appreciate all the comments there!

We heard about this donut shop in the south side that apparently has some of the best (and biggest) donuts in the city. It's called Dat Old Fashioned Donut, in Chatham. I've also heard not so many good things about the neighborhood. We won't have a car (taking Megabus into Chicago, staying at a hotel in the loop) and will be relying on cabs/public transit (CTA 3-day pass).

I've done some research and it looks like it is possible to get there via public transit, but it's a bit of a cruise! Also, while I'm trying not to be ""too"" concerned about safety (we'll be going there after a trip to Hyde Park and the Museum of Science and Industry, and there are 4 of us in the group) it is certainly a concern from what I've heard about the area.

Basically, is it worth it? What is the best route? Google Maps says to get there from the Museum of Science and Industry to take the #55 Bus Westbound to #4 Bus Southbound. Back to our hotel, take #4 Bus Northbound to the Green Line at 63rd/Cottage Grove to get us back to the Loop.

If it's not worth the hype, definitely let me know! Would there be any other donut shops that are worth visiting instead?

Thank you all! Looking forward to (once again) visiting your fair city!

TL;DR - Heard about awesome donut shop in not-so-awesome neighborhood. Is it worth going? If so, what's the best way via public transit?",chicago,5,1312659103.0,26,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/jazh4/hey_rchicago_visiting_chicago_the_weekend_of_825/

"Short, stupid question [What would you do?]","I was walking earlier tonight near Halsted and Briar. At the crossing, a driver ran the stop sign trying to make a left turn onto Halsted.

Considering I was in the intersection, I waived my arms frantically and jumped up instinctively. Driver stopped, and I sighed relief and shook my head. There were no other gestures.

As I'm passing by, the driver has the audacity to role down his window and say ""*It was an easy mistake asshole, don't be a dick about it.*""

I did not respond. Should I have? Part of me feels that - by leaving it alone - I enabled him to commit future issues, one that may cause bodily harm to a pedestrian in the future. Perhaps if I turned on him, he'd exercise caution going forward. Turning his carelessness back onto the passerby shouldn't be rewarded. But at the same time, I don't prefer to escalate things. It typically rewards neither party. What would you have done? This question sounds [and probably is] stupid, but considering he almost killed me, then insulted me, I'm interested in the best way to handle these things.",chicago,0,1536470738.0,13,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/9eaq2k/short_stupid_question_what_would_you_do/

Survival in the Second City (x-post Survival),"I am a ""country boy"" at heart but I presently reside within the big city of Chicago. With the way that this winter has been going I (like most Midwesterners I'm sure) have been feeling extremely stir crazy as of late being hunkered down in my house. While I love the outdoors, Chicago does not lend itself to a lot of great outdoorsmen/survivalist situations (unless dodging stray bullets counts, lol). That is until I discovered all of the fun that I could have out on the ice on Lake Michigan; building ice and snow shelters, exploring, hiking, etc.

In years past I would not venture too far out on the ice due to fear but with the consistently freezing temperatures this winter I decided a few weeks ago that the ice was more than safe to venture out on in ever increasing distances. Besides, it is crystal clear ice that you can see is easily 18 inches thick in most places, at a minimum. 

Let me mention that one of the reasons I enjoy it so much out there is because it is one of the only places that I have ever been to in the city where I can feel ""alone"" and as though I am not living amongst the throng of humanity that makes up this city. Additionally, I have found that I MOST enjoy it out there when it is snowing as well. It simply feels like I am in another world, isolated from humanity, doing it all on my own. 

So the snowstorm hit the city today and I had every intention, since early this morning, to hit up the ice world yet again today. I strap on all my layers and gear, head out of my house, and walk across the street to the lake and begin my trek. I head north east on the ice and am enjoying myself, nothing unusual at all. While I had previously had fun throwing giant ice blocks into the water by traveling to the waters edge, I had no intention of heading so close to the water today. 

I am walking along the ice (probably 20 minutes I had been walking) when all of a sudden I am swimming!! Oh SHIT!!! I am sinking quickly past my waist, my gloves are wet and it is hard to get traction to grab onto anything but I manage to grab a giant ice sheet that is sticking up vertically and I pull myself out of the water. Adrenaline is pumping but I am out of the water. 

""Time to get home,"" I tell myself and begin heading back towards shore. I am freezing but not cold (if that makes sense), likely the adrenaline at this point. I was scared but nothing major at this point. I know about hypothermia and I know I have more than enough time to get back home before anything serious happens. I begin walking back in the direction that I came from (or thought that I had come from) when all of a sudden the reality of the situation begins to hit me.

I. Can. Not. See. A. Thing. The snow had turned into white out conditions and is just pounding down on me. I can literally see no more than 10 feet in front my face. This is when the fear begins to set in. I have no idea what direction I need to travel. The snow is shifting directions it is blowing in (i had known the snow was coming out of the south west but with the shifting winds I lost that as a guide to direction) and disorientation sets in. So I choose a direction and begin walking. 

Nothing looks the way it should however. Or at least nothing looks familiar. The ice shelves, the vast expanses of flat ice, nothing looks familiar. I begin to doubt seriously that I am heading in the right direction. And of course I left my phone (with gps) purposefully at home this time because, as I told myself, ""There is no way I am going to need this with how many times I've done this before."" I keep telling myself to stay calm. I am getting colder, my clothes are freezing, my goggles are fogging over; this situation is going down hill quickly. 

I keep walking though in the direction I believe to be the shore. As well, I am choosing the ""path of least resistance,"" meaning I am avoiding the gigantic piles of ice sheet that jut up at surrealist angles...a broken ankle trap waiting to happen with the lack of vision, accumulating snow, and lack of traction that I have. I work my way around one of these huge ""piles"" and before me is a vast expanse of flat ice. I don't recall ever seeing such a wide open space before but it makes for easier walking so I begin heading that way. 

All of sudden I start hearing ice crack. I freeze in my tracks. My heart sinks. Fear rises. ""If I go through here I am certainly dead,"" I tell myself. I am 50 feet from one of the ice mounds (safety) and I can't see but feet in front of my face and I have to make a decision, and QUICK!

I change direction and head for the ice mound, except I am still thinking about the shore and not immediate safety. I walk a few steps, ice cracking under me with each step, and then i hear it.

""Slosh, slosh!"" I am walking into slush, with ice cracking around me! I am outrageously afraid!! I stop dead in my tracks. Look for the nearest route to the ice mound, and make a B-line for it. Ice cracking the whole time. I run, as best a run as I can muster at this point, and I make it to the ice mound. Safety!!! 

I reach the mound, climb to the highest point I can, and have a seat and begin to contemplate what my next move should be. I can sit here and wait for the snow to let up so I can get my bearings but risk hypothermia or I can keep moving (in some unknown direction that I think MAY BE the right direction) and try and get around this very dangerous section of thin ice that I stumbled upon. 

Last ditch effort, maybe I should yell for help. LOL!! ""HELP!!!"" ""HELP!!!"" I scream. Nothing. Of course. It is desperation for certain that made me think this may work. 

Then I resort to the only option that I know will work, and I pray. 

""Jesus, get me out of here."" 

""Jesus, SAVE me!""

I am compelled at this point. What I'm hearing in my head is, ""Keep moving.""

So I follow that instruction and decide to keep moving along the ice mounds. SLOW going and super dangerous. These are sheets upon sheets of ice, hundreds of pounds of ice (sheets easily a foot thick) sticking up at vertical angles. I'm climbing over them, around them, through them. They break sometimes and it becomes clear that I could easily get trapped under one of these if they broke at an inopportune time. But I keep moving along this mound that twists directions. I don't know if I'm headed in the right direction but at least I am in no danger of falling through again. 

I climb down off the mound and begin walking on the flat ice right next to where this mound starts. Still able to see so very little. I am getting very worried about what I should do. I pray again. ""Jesus, HELP!"" At that moment I hear it, finally, something I can use to gauge where I am at. In the far off distance I hear a cop siren. It is hard to gauge exactly which direction its coming from but it gives me a relative idea of where to go. I shift course slightly and begin walking towards the direction of where the siren came from. 

Slow going. My clothes are completely frozen. My boots are water logged. The snow is soooo deep in places that it is sucking every ounce of energy I have to walk through it, let alone having to climb through several more ice mounds on my way back in. It is extremely difficult to maintain a straight course with the shifting and blinding wind snow combination. 

Finally, far off in the distance, I am able to see the main ""ice cliff"" that you have to climb down over to get where I was. I trudge along, make it to the cliff, climb up over it, and walk across the park to my house. I am DRAINED but alive. Get home, shed my gear, start a warm bath, end.

My feet and toes were deep red and blue but they are alright now. I don't think I will be going out there again like that anytime soon but I learned some very valuable lessons today. The importance of a compass (or GPS) even a few feet from home, what its REALLY like hiking in white out conditions with no landmarks anywhere, the importance of staying calm NO MATTER WHAT, and how things can change in a literal instant from having fun to a survival type situation. Thank the Lord that I am here now able to type this all out and not swimming with the fishes (or freezing with them) on an ice shelf over Lake Michigan. I am truly lucky to be alive today I feel, things could have been SO much worse. 

Oh yeah, I was VERY lost indeed it seems. Best I can tell I was heading due South when I encountered the thin ice the second time when I needed to be going due East. I am stunned at how easy it was to get so completely disoriented so quickly. Yikes, scary stuff indeed! And to think, all this took place within .5 - .75 miles from my home and an unbelievable amount of people, all of whom had no idea what harrowing survival situation was unfolding in my life.

**TL;DR:** Went exploring on the ice over Lake Michigan. Fell through the ice unexpectedly. Got lost (for over 45 minutes) in white out snow (blizzard) conditions on my way back in to the shore. Almost fell through the ice again. Harrowing climb through dangerous ice mounds. Prayed to God for direction and then heard a police siren in the far distance. Headed that direction and finally found my way home. I'll keep all my toes. Learned a lot of lessons. Won't be going on the ice again anytime soon I think.

Urban Outsitters Owner Responds to Dognapping Story Inconsistencies,"I am a customer at Urban Outsitters and received the following email. I thought it might provide a different perspective that what was being reported.

[Background for anyone who hasn't been following the story.](http://wgntv.com/2015/02/21/doggie-day-care-owner-responds/)

Dear Customer:

You may have felt slightly confused, as I feel somewhat slighted on the fact that much of the facts were omitted from the recent Urban Out Sitters stolen van news reports. The entire staff and I wish to write a summation, a testimony and statement of truth to all Urban Out Sitters clientele and inform the media in hopes that they will rectify, correct and justify the situation they manipulated from last few days broadcast.

First and foremost, no one at Urban Out Sitters lied to the media, nor intentionally twisted turn-of-events. More importantly everyone at UOS spent sleepless nights worrying and searching for the lost pups and was extremely cooperative and compassionate toward the welfare of the dogs.

This past Wednesday evening, I received a call from one of my dog walkers at Urban Out Sitters. At approximately 4pm, one of our vans had been stolen and the driver was talking to police. I asked to speak to the driver. He told me the van had been stolen, he had a gun pointed at him and “the guys” took off with the van. I asked which way the van was headed and he told they were headed west on Grand Ave. When I arrived on the scene, I asked the driver if he was okay, he said yes, (a little shaken up), but OK.

I started to call the customers involved. I informed them that the car had been stolen at gunpoint and two people fled with the dogs in the car. I asked them to come to Urban Out Sitters so we could talk and figure out how to locate the dogs. All of my clients showed up, along with the media. (a lot of media). A client had tweeted to NBC and several other media outlets that “Dogs missing after armed carjackers take doggie day care's van - FOX 32 News Chicago.” Moments after the tweet, the press started to arrive at Urban Out Sitters. I spoke to the jam packed lobby at River West, Urban Out Sitters. I went on camera to say what had happened. I explained that I had a conversation with my driver and that he was held at gunpoint and ordered to exit the car. After I finished with the press, I headed out along with many other staff to search for the missing vehicle. After a sleepless night of combing the streets, The next morning, a detective working the case asked if we had any video footage. He wanted to see if the assailants had been watching the store. I pulled up video footage from our cameras DVR system.

In the video footage, the two assailants approached the vehicle. The vehicle was not running or left unattended. The driver had two keys one was in the van ashtray, the other with him on his key ring. He thought he locked the car, as we have a two key system in place. In the footage, you can see the van’s exhaust spurt out by the engine being turned over. The van was located directly near the front door of the facility (with the driver only steps away in front of the van) by the time he could get the vehicle, the two men already started the car, reversed the van, and sped away. At this point, the driver and a UOS dog walker immediately jumped into action, got in their car and bike to follow the carjacked vehicle. The driver (witness) and walker chased after the van and the driver confronted the two thieves at one of the intersecting streets near Milwaukee, Chicago and Ogden area. At this point the driver (witness) cornered them. At the vehicle one of the thieves in the van pointed a gun at the driver (witness) and told him to exit away from the vehicle. I was shocked and appreciative how he put his life in a dangerous situation by chasing and confronting the assailants. UOS is working diligently with investigators (which you can verify) to get camera footage from the blue light cameras showcasing the secondary confrontation Urban Out Sitters is also organizing a search for the two assailants by offering a reward to anyone who may know who they are.

Omitted by the press:
- the van was not running.
- the (witness) is an Urban Out Sitters employee
- the car was stolen
- the video footage was provided by Urban Out Sitters
- the footage was shortened and you don't see the driver pursuing the assailants

Overall, this was a horrible situation we wouldn’t wish on anyone, it has been an emotional tragedy, it was not a careless regard, or negligence. Fortunately the dogs and driver are ok. We are sorry if you feel that you have been mislead. But we all know how the media can substantialize or manipulate events. I had not received the full story, just that “The van was stolen, they pointed a gun at me and took off with the van” That is the information I shared with the press. I was later told this information was incorrect when I spoke to a detective and we viewed the video, who informed me that the story from my driver was reported correctly and that I didn’t have the full scope of the incident.

If anything, you are getting the correct story, and above all know UOS did not take this issue lightly. With over fifteen years of success, caring and loving every clients pets as like our own. Above all – we strive to build trust and safety.

The outpour of support from the entire Urban Out Sitters clientele has been phenomenal. UOS is extremely grateful for their generosity, love and understanding over the past few days. The overall community outreach, support and the effects this has caused actually instilled positive changes that will be beneficial toward the pets who share our great city.

In addition, Urban Out Sitters would like to share its newest elevated levels of security. We have installed GPS Tracking Systems into our cars and 2-way cameras into all pet taxis. We also got calls and support from other local pet care services. They have told us they too will be installing GPS tracking devices within their vehicles.

Also, last year, UOS has been developing and branding a newer GPS technology to help, monitor, and be centralized within Urban Out Sitters client database. Each GPS tracking will be a pet tag that all dogs will be required to wear to ensure that if a dog is lost, or stolen, it can be quickly recovered. In the event a client’s dog is lost, the client will be able to log into their online account, or thru Urban Out Sitters app to locate their loved one immediately. Urban Out Sitters has been working on this over the past 6 months and anticipate it will be ready by Spring.

Should you have any further questions, or wish more detail surrounding the event, feel free to contact me directly.

Sincerely-
Joseph Giannini and Company ",chicago,16,1424540099.0,13,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/2wo78b/urban_outsitters_owner_responds_to_dognapping/
Potential tourist this weekend! Questions!,"Hey guys, I'm a 20 year old male currently living in Arizona, lifetime baseball fan, and I'm planning to hit up Chicago for Saturday and Sunday nights on a whim. My whole life I've promised myself if the Cubbies ever make the World Series I'll be in Chicago for the games, and low-and-behold here we are. 

So I have a plane ticket to O'Hare lined up for about $250, and a motel on Congress for about $44 a night for two nights. I just had questions about the train lines, specifically the blue and red line. I looked it up and maps says the blue line goes from O'Hare to downtown, and that the red line goes from my hotel to Wrigley. Would these be viable ways of getting around? Or would getting an uber or something be best? 

Also, what are cheap food options around downtown? I'm not looking for anything fancy, I'll stick to McDonalds if I have to, being a broke college kid travelling on a budget. 

And safety? What streets, locations, areas should I do my best to avoid? Should I not stay any later than a certain time in certain places, etc. 

Since I'm a native Arizonan, born and raised, I'm pretty ignorant to the cold. It says online that it might rain in Chicago Saturday and Sunday, and should be around the 50s. Is that accurate or should I prepare for worse? 

I'm 20 years old so I can't go out to any bars and drink (legally) unfortunately. Is there any kind of viewing parties/restaurants I could hit up that I could watch the games at on Saturday and Sunday? 

If there is any other information I could use please please let me know! I've only ever heard good things about your guys' city, and I am so excited to finally see it in person.

Residential Street Boulevard Rights/Responsibility question.,"So, we have a neighbor on our street...who has been hassling dog walkers.

The problem is that since she has purchased the property, and moved into the neighborhood...anytime a dog is on the boulevard grass strip along the street, she begins harassing the person walking the dog. Now...our street does not have a poop issue. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find dog feces anywhere on our street. Im actually impressed on how clear our street is, because we're just a nice residential street, but even on such a street you typically see a turd or two that someone left behind. 

Having lived in Chicago all my life, I have always been under the impression that the boulevards, while maintained by the property owner...are actually owned by the city and/or enjoys a right of access/easement. 

We have more than a few people in this neighborhood who have and walk their dogs. This woman has literally come running out of her residence screaming at people...so, obviously want some clarification here. Can people safely tell this woman to get stuffed and leave them alone? 

***EDIT***: The consensus is that the strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street is city property, but maintained by the property owner, and thus...right of way and public use is not inhibited and she can be told to buzz off.

"Question for dog owners in the city, about dogsitting","Hello r/chicago!

I recently moved to Chicago from Omaha, NE. I have a dog, 60lb boxer mix named Toby. He is a wonderful dog, but is having some trouble adjusting to city life. He has some separation anxiety when we leave the apartment (whining, sometimes barking). I am working with him right now - trying to leave for small periods of time to get him acclimated. 

My birthday is Sept 27th and my boyfriend wanted to treat me with a day/night on the town. I am very concerned about my dog being alone for that long, not just for his stress/safety but for the other residents of our apartment. 

Does anyone have any recommendations? Are there any services like an overnight dog sitting, but for during the day? I would put him in doggie daycare but I am still working on socializing him and am concerned a large group of dogs might be way too much.

Thanks so much for your help!

A message to all protestors. Specifically Chicago.,"A message to All protestors around the country, specifically Chicago.

The Chicago Police departments actions/policies are well known.

They have also been monitored by police scanner for the last several days.

The police are using the protests to mine your personal information. They are listening to your phone calls, watching your text messages/tweets in real time. They will use this information against you and your family. Believe it.

1)	STINGRAY 

There is a black SUV with a large T-bar on top that has been following the protest. This vehicle is equipped with STINGRAY. This device acts as if it is a real cell phone tower. It tricks your phone into connecting with it, instead or your carrier. The police can then hack you phone. No data is safe. If your phone connects to their STINGRAY, they will have everything. If things get heated, they can also Jam all cellular and wi-fi service within several blocks. This vehicle is also equipped with multiple High definition cameras, thermal imaging, shotgun microphones, etc.

2)Your cell phone.

DO NOT bring your personal cell phone, or wi-fi enabled camera, or i-pad with you.

If you must have a phone with you, and/or are able to afford it, Buy a “burner phone”. You can purchase a 10-20 dollar phone, and a 20 dollar activation card in any grocery store, Family Dollar, 7-11, etc. Pay cash for the phone and the card. Do not buy groceries on a credit card, and then also pay cash for the phone separately at the same check-out. Buy your phone as a stand alone CASH purchase in a store you do not normally shop at. 

Create an anonymous email account either from a public computer, or use TOR. You will need this account to activate a new twitter account and most likely to activate you burner phone (depending on the service). 

You will need to call from another phone to activate your burner. Do not call from you home, or your cell. Find a pay phone, or some kind of public phone to use to activate the burner. 

Do NOT call your friends, family, anyone you know from this phone. Do not give your friends and family the phone number. Do not log into any of your personal accounts from this phone (facebook, instagram, twitter, reddit, etc).

Use the phone to create a brand new twitter account that cannot be tied to you in any way. Do not upload your picture to this account. Do not follow yourself, friends, or family from this twitter account. Do not log into this new account from any other computer or phone. The only thing you will be using this new twitter account for, is monitoring twitter, and uploading photos and information from the burner phone about the protest. Do not tell anyone you are associated with about this twitter account.

ONLY bring the burner phone to the protest. Do not turn the phone on until you reach the protest. Turn the phone off and pull the battery out of it when you are leaving the protest. (just turning it off is not enough, you must take the battery out when you are not using it, do not wait until you get home.)

Your only communication with the outside world while at the protest should be twitter.

3) Tactics

In order to try and keep traffic flowing, and keep the protestors in their control, the police have done the following in Chicago.
Marked police cars do not follow the group, they are on parallel streets to the group, and have been told to keep their lights and sirens off. 

The only cars that follow the crowd closely are the Paddy Wagon, and STINGRAY.
The best strategy to keep the police cars and the STINGRAY as far away from the protest as possible is to ONLY WALK AGAINST TRAFFIC ON ONE WAY STREETS. It will be nearly impossible for the police vehicles to follow you if the street is clogged with traffic that is moving the opposite way, even if the protest is confined to the sidewalk. CHANGE YOUR DIRECTION OFTEN. Use side streets.

Do not tweet out to anyone where the protest group is planning to go.

Most police officers are extremely out of shape. Combine this with the heavy load of gear they are forced to wear, and they will have a hard time walking long distances. As a group, the protestors should keep their pace up. Rotate leaders in the group to be able to maintain a brisk pace. Occasionally, the entire group should start to jog, force the police to run with you. They will not be able to keep up, and will be forced to rotate out. Only stop the group at major intersections, this will give you a few minutes to rest, and force the police that are following you into traffic duty, denying them a break. 

4)Bike cops

The Police have been using the bike cops very effectively. The bikes are able to move through traffic much easier than cars, and they are fast enough to be able to “leapfrog” the protest group, getting to intersections before the group does, setting up a blockade line, and forcing the protestors to go the direction they want. 

They have been very vocal about keeping Lake Shore Drive, the Ohio/Ontario feeder, Michigan ave , Congress Parkway and the bridges open on the radio. These should be you main targets to most effectively keep them busy, focused more on traffic than on the protestors themselves. Changing direction often will help you keep the bike cops from beating you to intersections. 

Bicycles have a major weak point. The tires. High pressure rubber tires are very susceptible to small sharp objects that might happen to be in the street. Use this to your advantage. 

5) Police identification.

There have been a lot of uniformed officers following the protests. They think they are hiding in their numbers just like you think you are hiding in yours.  These officers do not want to be identified any more than you do, in fact, they know if their picture is plastered across the web, they are less likely to get promoted.

PROTESTORS SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION AND TAKE PICTURES OF EVERY POLICE OFFICER AT THE PROTEST.

Take close up pictures of every police officer you see. Get their name and badge number in the picture. Question every officer you see.  If your phone records video, confront every officer, ask for their name, badge number, Beat number, and superior officers name. Upload any pictures or video you get, even if they refuse to tell you who they are, a good close up picture is all you really need. Facial recognition software will identify them. They all have family’s, friends, and most have facebook accounts. Someone has uploaded another picture of them with a name attached at some point. They cannot hide.

Any information/pics/video you obtain about police officers at the protest, tweet under multiple hashtags. Address these tweets to @Youranonglobal.  Do not send this info if the STINGRAY is within sight of you. Walk several blocks away from the protest if you are going to upload critical information. 


6) Undercover police

There are undercover officers among the protestors. If you are paying attention, they are easily spotted. Keep an eye out for white men 25-30, walking alone. They probably will not talk to many people. They will seem friendly when talking to you but ask a lot of personal questions. They have recording devices on their person. They will be carrying a well-concealed weapon, most likely a small caliber handgun. They will never unzip their jacket. Most will have a shoulder holster, and when you are walking behind them you will notice that both of their arms do not hang down and sway the same. They probably have crew cuts, or noticeably short hair and are clean shaven. They will regularly break off from the group, and then mysteriously reappear. They are terrible actors, and if monitored closely, will give away their identity by occasionally nodding, or acknowledging other uniformed officers that they know. 

IF YOU SUSPECT A PROTESTOR OF BEING AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER, NICELY ASK FOR THEM TO OPEN THEIR JACKET. IF YOU SEE A WEAPON, VERY LOUDLY SHOUT “GUN”, AND FORCE THE UNIFORMED OFFICERS TO GET INVOLVED.  GET A PICTURE OF THEIR FACE.

7) Police scanner

The Chicago police have been using what they call “Citywide 6” to communicate with each other for all radio calls related to the protest. These radio calls can be monitored in real time with any one of several “scanner” phone apps. They know they are being monitored however. Unfortunately for them, the city has not been able to purchase expensive encrypted radios for all officers, so they have no choice but to use open frequencies to communicate. There are several people tweeting out their radio messages in real time. You can follow this info at #chicagoscanner, amongst other places. 

Knowing that they are being monitored on the radio, the police have resorted to using their personal cell phones to communicate sensitive information that they do not want heard by the public. Stingray can be used against them because of this. The sergeant in charge of organizing the officers assigned to the protest has been on site the last 2 nights.
He has been in a marked police car with the plate 41X on the top. If the car is spotted, surrounding it with protestors will put him within range of the STINGRAY, thereby limiting his phones use. Get a picture of him.

8)L-RAD 

Up until this point, the Chicago police have not used L-RAD (google it), they do have it however. The Chicago police are fully militarized. If the protests grow, you can be sure it will show up. All protestors should have ear plugs. The best you can find. If you are using “foam plugs”, additional isolation can be achieved by wiping some petroleum jelly on the  plug before inserting it in your ear. Even with ear plugs, the volume of the device is still going to be painful, but its throw is only about 30 degrees off axis, so if you need to get away from it, run 90 degrees to the beam, don’t try and outrun it further down the street.


9) Be smart. Don't give people you do not know, even within the protest group, any personal information. Do not use your last name. Do not tell people what account you are tweeting from. Know your rights before you protest in the streets. Do not go to the protest alone, go with a friend or relative that you know you can trust. Always move together.

The Police departments goal is to suppress the movement. They will do this by any means necessary.
They will follow you home if they perceive you as a ""leader"" or a threat. They will harass you, pull your car over for no reason, stop you in subway stations. Do not let yourself be followed when leaving. 

Be safe. Stay strong.

Can anyone living in the area speak to the safety of the Sedgwick station and Sedgwick and Blackhawk streets at night? Thanks!

"Going to start working the overnight shift in the loop, live in Bucktown. Do I need a car?","I survived my first year here without a car just fine. Groceries and random chores were a pain, as was getting around the city to meet friends. I spent a ton on Uber. Also, my significant other lives in Milwuakee so getting there via amtrak and a combination of ubers would cost about 50-80 bucks round trip (alternate weekend visits).

I commuted to work using the blue line (a 15 min walk from my place, followed by another 10 min walk in the loop) or the 56 bus (which won't be running during overnight). I also bike to work currently because its the fastest way to get there. 

**The reasons I am considering getting a car:**

* Safety at night, avoid walking to blue line at midnight. Instead I would have a 10 min drive to the loop with free parking there until 8 AM (Which is when I could get out of work)

* Save money on potential ubers to work (when its bad weather/too cold, I would probably uber to work rather than walk to blue line $10 each ride)

* I live in a neighborhood with plenty of street parking

* Save money on bi-weekly commute to Milwaukee (50-80 bucks)

* Huge time spent on shopping/running chores (groceries, dry cleaning, random purchases)

* I can afford it without adjusting my lifestyle choices too much (In fact it could save me a lot of money)

**Reasons why I am not completely convinced:**

* I could get around groceries/goods by ordering them on amazon/instacart

* Leasing/Financing/Insuring/Maintaining a car would potentially cost me 300-400 a month plus some down-payment

* Not entirely sure of my future location (which is why I am leaning towards leasing)

* I could bike at night to work for the time being, until winter.

Thanks!

**TL:DR:**
Switching to Overnight Shift. Work in loop live in bucktown. Also go visit SO in Milwaukee. Should I get a car?

What resources should I check if I wanted to find updated information on a crime commit near my apartment last night?,Basically last night I woke up around 4:30 AM to hear very desperate calls for help somewhere outside my building. I called 911 immediately and considered walking downstairs to see what the commotion was since I couldn't see it from my window. After hanging up with dispatch the screaming stopped and a few minutes later I watched as a cop car turned onto my block. Still don't know what could have happened but it sounded terrifying and I want to know if that woman ever got the help she needed. I can't find any recent crime reports online in my area.

Need info about the neighborhood.,"I'll be in Chicago with my husband and child in June and we're looking at a few apartments as an alternative to hotels.

"[MINI-VAN UPDATE] My friend's stolen van is still in Chicago!

My friend just posted again on Facebook about her stolen mini-van, and I just thought I wanted to let the Chicago reddit community know. Not necessarily to be on the lookout (let's face it, it's like a needle in a haystack at this point), but just in case if anyone is curious.

My friend and her daughter went to the carnival tonight at St. Barbara's Church. Her daughter drove with her car and they were parked at the intersection on Lyman &amp; Farrell (one of the small neighborhood streets in Bridgeport near St. Barb's and Palmisano Park). While they were getting into her car, they literally saw her van drive by and pass them up on Lyman. They quickly called 911 and chased after them. I guess they lost track of the van in an alley at 37th and Hermitage.

Good news is that they saw who was driving the van. It was a Hispanic man and Hispanic woman. They got a decent look at their facial features so they reported all of that new information to the police. Again, here are the details from before...

* Stolen between 8pm last night and 11am this morning (June 17) at the intersection between 35th street and Marshfield in the McKinley Park neighborhood
* 2002 Chrysler Town and Country License plate # R499050 light blue almost silver in color, some minor dents and rust.
* It has a soccer ball decal in the back window
* If you see it, please call the police and PM me. She has her phone number on Facebook and the Bridgeport Chicago IL Facebook page, but not sure if she wants me to put it on reddit.
* Again, [here's a pic](http://www.admiralmotors.com/chicago/2002-Chrysler-Town-Country_01_85ad005e1656993a49e7256550fbc8ad.jpg) if you want to visualize it.

Loop clean up after this weekend’s events,"UPDATE 8:40 am 6/2: Good morning all, unfortunately I have not had much success hearing back from the wards. However it is not surprising due to everything that is happening around our neighborhoods and suburbs. I will continue tracking and updating this post as I come across any new information. If you have anything that can be useful for all of us, please DM so I can include it in the post. Below are some of the organizations that I could locate online. One word of wisdom: PLEASE BE CAREFUL OF POTENTIAL SCAMS, BE AWARE THAT IN THESE UNFORTUNATE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS THERE ARE THOSE WHO TRY TO OBTAIN FINANCIAL GAIN BY CHEATING AND MISREPRESENTING THEMSELVES. PLEASE DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE PRIOR TO PROVIDING ANY SORT OF FINANCIAL HELP.

UPDATE as of 7:30 am 6/1: First of all, thank you for your patience while myself and a few others have been trying to figure out how we can help. 




1. As we have all seen over the past couple of days, our neighborhoods got destroys. So please take a look around your neighborhood first. See where you can give a hand. I heard about some members of this post are going over to Walgreens in Wicker Park located on Milwaukee and Armirage. So if you are in the area, they will appreciate a hand.

Location: 1750 E. 71st, Chicago (meet in the parking lot)
Call for more information: 773-609-3007

this: https://twitter.com/capitolfax/status/1267309319395164161?s=20

3. Please check FB to see if there are any other established organizations that are looking for volunteers. 

4. I emailed the Alderman to see where we are needed the most. 

5. Lastly if anyone has any additional information and would like to have it posted here for everyone to see, please DM me and I will update this post. 


Thank You all for your continued support of our city, communities and your patience. 

Please be safe out there and do not forget your PPE! Every single one of us matters and can make a difference!

Would anyone be interested in joining up to help clean up the Loop after this protest? 

IMO, it won’t benefit any of us if our beautiful city remains in the current condition

—:—-:—-:——:—-:——:——:——:——:——:——:—-

UPDATE As of 6:30 this evening, I have not been able to get any information as to the best way to proceed. I will continue trying tomorrow. All I know is that with everything that’s going on, and CTA being closed, let’s see what tomorrow brings. Please be safe and don’t put yourself in compromising situations. Unfortunately our help will have to be POSTPONED again. As usual, if anyone hears anything to the contrary, please post it here or DM me. Thank you all! 

HELLO ALL, I just called the City Hall as well as Mayor’s Office and could not reach anyone regarding if we can go tomorrow or not. I was told by the City Hall Officer that an entire city is blocked off. I also tried reaching out to the Mayor via Next Door, but it looks like direct messages are blocked. If anyone knows other ways to reach either the Mayor or the Governor, I would appreciate your help. I also tried 311 and CPD. To figure out what to do we need someone with the authority. 
Lastly: my question to them was: can a number of volunteers go into the areas between 6-10 to clean up. 

Thank you for your help




UPDATE 4:41 pm: Since I don’t know if we will be able to access the areas that need our help, I will continue updating as I find out more. If anyone hears anything, please continue sharing in this post or DM me. 


UPDATE as of 3:48 pm: Someone has just informed me of the following: “The police are already trying to focus on more protesting. Over the police scanner you would have to be a resident of the area to go in it”. “Not until closures are lifted, looting was still going on this morning early afternoon. The wood was removed and more damage was done at a Walgreens, at adams and Michigan”

Has anyone else heard about it? I would appreciate the confirmation. 




UPDATE as of 4:30 am: I JUST (4:37 am on Sunday 5/31/20) SPOKE WITH DISTRICT 1 PD and WAS ADVISED THAT MOST OF THE BRIDGES ARE STILL UP and WITH ALL THE TENSION, IT WOULD BE WISER TO PROVIDE HELP WHEN ALL OF THIS IS OVER AS THEY EXPECTING FOR MORE AFTER THE CURFEW. 

To avoid unnecessary tension, as I am sure PD is on the high alert, and to provide the most benefit, I believe we should CANCEL today and regroup once we know protests are over. 

PLEASE DON’T PUT YOURSELF INTO UNNECESSARY DANGER, AS SUCH, LETS CANCEL TODAY and I WILL CONTINUE CHECKING with CPD and KEEPING EVERYONE UPDATED as to when we are ok to go in to help. 

Thank you to all of you who were interested in doing this with me. I will keep you all posted through here with any further information. 




Edit 3: Please please please check the news/reddit or whatever your source of info is prior to heading out. Let’s all be safe. And lastly - I am not sure how you are planning on getting there, however, I have suspicion that Divy bike stations might not be available. 

Edit 2: I will post an invite link for general info in a few minutes. Thank you to the creators if  for doing it so quickly!! 

New link will be provided with updated details


Edit 1: 

Thank you all for loving our city!

Has ICE arrested one “dangerous criminal” in Chicagoland?,"I may have missed it, but has ICE arrested one purported dangerous criminal so far in Chicagoland? You know they’d publicize that so much, and I’ve yet to see it — and I’ve been following this semi-closely.

I think it tells you all you need to know when you see what neighborhoods they’re in. A lot of middle-class neighborhoods, most with below-average gang presence, and targeting the non-dangerous, low-hanging targets of people who need to be out for work or bringing their kids to school — or, the other day, the lady taking her kid to the hospital.

The combat gear makes this so sickening. They don’t want to put themselves at risk at all and go after who they’re claiming. I’d think by sheer chance though they’d be picking up some real criminals, murderers and rapists, like Trump claims.",chicago,865,1761150029.0,234,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1odcubq/has_ice_arrested_one_dangerous_criminal_in/
The amount of dangerous/bad driving in Chicago is absolutely out of control.,"I realize this may be an unpopular post on this sub given how many comments I see refusing to even engage with this fact when it is brought up on other posts, but the events of this past week have been too much for me to not attempt to find some outlet for all of this frustration.

Don't get me wrong, I have lived in this city for a long time and I know that not only has driving always been bad all over for Chicago but it has only continued to get worse and worse since the pandemic. And just to be clear, this is not isolated to any neighborhood, area, or type of driver/car. It is endemic throughout the city and the problems are all the same.

Drivers simply do not follow the rules of the road and operate like they are the only car in existence. Never mind illegal turns, driving both dangerously over *or under* the speed limit, the fact that almost a dozen times a day, I see drivers not only speed up to go through yellow lights but also blast through ***after they have already turned red***.

The amount of disregard drivers have for not only others' but even their own safety is nearly as disgustingly reprehensible as the city itself failing to address such a widespread issue. Instead, the city continues to pour more and more money into law enforcement that fails to even attempt to resolve the very basic, extremely dangerous circumstances that a majority of citizens face every day when simply living and working within Chicago.

Editorial: City Council should reject proposed $1.25M settlement in Dexter Reed police shooting,"The City Council should not approve the proposed $1.25 million settlement to the survivors of Dexter Reed, shot dead last March by Chicago police after he opened fire on them.

This is not to say that all the actions surrounding the traffic stop of the 26-year-old Reed in Humboldt Park on that fateful day were appropriate and shouldn’t be second-guessed. A group of five officers, dressed not in uniform but in tactical clothing and gear, surrounded Reed’s car for reasons that remain unclear (and are still under investigation).

Ordered to get out of his car, Reed refused and instead rolled up his darkly tinted windows. The situation escalated quickly, with Reed shooting at the officers from inside his car and hitting one (thankfully not fatally). Officers opened fire in return, and Reed staggered out of his car and was shot to death.

The Civilian Office of Police Accountability, the agency that investigates allegations of police misconduct and recommends disciplinary action, released the horrifying video within a few weeks. Andrea Kersten, COPA’s chief administrator, then went on an ill-advised media tour in which she shared preliminary conclusions she’d drawn about what the officers had done wrong.

Reed’s family used much of the information Kersten provided in advance of completion of COPA’s investigation in the wrongful-death lawsuit they filed just a few months later. And now here we are, with a proposed settlement readied for council approval and COPA’s probe still not complete! The Finance Committee is scheduled to consider the matter Monday.

Much of the initial criticism of the cops focused on the number of shots they fired in rapid fashion — 96 bullets in 41 seconds, as numerous headlines trumpeted. But the family’s attorney now emphasizes the circumstances of the traffic stop itself, suggesting that an allegedly improper pretext for stopping Reed would have been the plaintiffs’ primary argument in favor of liability.

There are — and have been — reasonable debates to have about the Chicago Police Department’s use of pretextual stops (pulling over cars for minor infractions as a means to search for drugs, guns or both) in neighborhoods populated mainly by minorities. On this subject, CPD Superintendent Larry Snelling has agreed with the critics, at least in part, and has de-emphasized and reduced the number of such stops.

But, even if a stop isn’t justified, we all should be able to agree that police are within their rights to shoot back if someone they’ve pulled over shoots at them first. Police work in Chicago is extraordinarily hazardous duty in a city beset with firearms, many of which are illegally converted via cheap, easily obtainable gadgets into the equivalent of a machine gun.

Paying an excessively large settlement to the survivors of those killed after violently attacking cops sends a few unmistakable messages. In the more immediate sense, the message sent to the officers involved in the Reed shooting, who remain suspended while they await the outcome of COPA’s investigation and the departmental response, is that the city already considers them responsible. That’s inappropriate.

But, more broadly, the message delivered to all the other men and women on our streets putting their lives in jeopardy each day to try to make Chicago safer is that they put their livelihoods and reputations at risk when they use deadly force to protect themselves against someone shooting at them.

In November, Officer Enrique Martinez, responding to a call for help on the South Side, was shot to death from inside a car he had approached. Martinez lost his life in a hail of bullets from one of those illegally converted handguns.

You have to be a cop, or be a loved one of a cop, to understand the bravery required, and the fear that must be overcome, in order to walk up to a car in many Chicago neighborhoods and confront those inside the vehicle. Especially at night, as Martinez had to do.

The argument for settling with Dexter Reed’s family is that paying the costs of defense and risking a judgment might well cost taxpayers considerably more than $1.25 million. That sort of calculation is always a consideration in litigation against those perceived as having deep pockets, whether that’s the nation’s third-largest city or a corporation or a wealthy individual.

But this case strikes us as about more than money. Sometimes a principled stand is in order.

We have a Police Department that appears to be starting to get its footing back after cops were castigated in far too many corners of this city during the reckoning following George Floyd’s murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. We seem to be heading toward an appropriate middle ground between “backing the blue” no matter the facts, which dominated for decades, and the “defund the police” madness that ensued in more recent times. Surely, it’s possible to hold police accountable for wrongdoing or terrible mistakes while also supporting them when they act reasonably in the face of mortal danger.

“Where is our line in the sand?” Ald. Anthony Napolitano, 41st, told the Chicago Sun-Times. “These officers were fired upon. One of them was hit. … You can’t Monday-morning-quarterback that. It’s next to impossible unless you’re gonna put robots on the street.”

When you shoot at police officers, you bear at least most of the responsibility for what happens next. And the next time police shoot and kill someone who shoots first at them, how will the city defend itself from that lawsuit, having capitulated in this one?

Since the mayor’s Law Department isn’t going to do it, the City Council should draw that line in the sand and reject the settlement.",chicago,311,1739117824.0,322,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1ili9ro/editorial_city_council_should_reject_proposed/

then by Foster some other moron carelessly let his toddler wander off the walking lanes onto the bike lanes when several bikers including myself are approaching yards away causing us to veer into oncoming walk lane traffic to spare the lil guy.

Is Chicago a good place for queer people?,"I'm a transmasculine nb person currently living in KY and trying to think about where to move to in the future. I want to avoid small towns, and I'd like to move somewhere where I can meet more queer friends and potentially date. Is Chicago a good place for this, and is it safe for queer people?

EDIT: Another question- are there a decent amount of queer spaces in Chicago that aren't just bars and clubs?

EDIT 2: So many replies holy shit. Thank you all! And another question- a lot of you mention queer-friendly neighborhoods like Boystown, Andersonville, Lakeview, or Edgewater, but how close are those neighborhoods to bus lines or subways? I hate driving and I've heard Chicago's public transit is pretty good, but what are the best options / are they close to those neighborhoods?

EDIT 3: Another question, this one is kind of dumb, but as someone who knows little about the layout of Chicago, on apartment hunting sites, what streets would those gay neighborhoods be listed under? When I search the names of the neighborhoods specifically, I don't get too many results. Also, what's the rent like? About how much could I expect to pay a month?

EDIT 4 lmao: Any advice for apartment hunting from states over? I know some websites have virtual tours, but it doesn't feel quite the same as actually checking an apartment out in person. Also, any advice for finding roommates? Roommates generally seem like a decent way to cut down on rent and living costs, but as someone not from Chicago, I'm not sure how to find prospective roommates there.

EDIT 5: To those recommending Chicago Queer Exchange or similar groups, do you have any advice for navigating them? I'm nervous about the idea of rooming with people I haven't met in person and am unsure of what to do about that.

Avoid LSD if you can,"We just almost got caught, we were coming south on LSD, planning to get off at north. City and cops have the exits closed.

Unique Driving Rules in Chicago,"I have never taken the driver's exam (written or road) in Chicago but feel there are likely some things in the driver's handbook that I didn't learn growing up:

* Whenever possible, block the intersection. Ignore any signs indicating otherwise.  Ignore the crosswalk timer which might influence whether you can/should block the intersection.  Your fellow commuters won't mind one bit and neither will pedestrians who can easily navigate around you.  It's far more important for you to save those precious seconds.
   * Don't worry about the red-light cameras.  Half of them don't work and for (actually) reading this handbook, you can not only save a few seconds but avoid paying a ticket as the appendix of this handbook has a list of the working red-light cameras.
* Whenever you leave the city and are on an open freeway/tollway, continue to drive slowly in the left lane.  This is your reward for dealing with the stress and reduced fuel economy of city driving.  It is neither dangerous nor stressful to others who prefer to drive at or above the speed limit.
* Feel free to use the left-hand turn lanes on NB J-BPDLSD (which you are required to refer to it by as ""LSD"" was too convenient and overused) even when not making a left turn in the area between Roosevelt and Maggie Daley Park.  It is understood traffic is an undue encumbrance and those lanes are seldom used, and inexplicably long.  The drivers behind you who actually want to make a left but can't when the left-turn light is given won't mind and neither those going straight who you will have to cut off.
* Special rule for rideshare drivers and Amazon delivery trucks ONLY: pull over wherever convenient for you to do so.  Don't worry about looking for a spot to pull over closer to the curb.  Preferred to take up as much of the single lane as possible.  But remember you MUST turn the wheel toward the parked cars when stopping on a downhill and away from the parked cars when on an uphill.

(on top of $206 M already spent this year) Chicago police misconduct costs keep soaring with proposed $35 million in deals,"Sorry--it's not a free site. Anyway, the BUDGET for the year for this is/was $82.6 million. Mayor Johnson has already approved $206 million. We're likely going to be paying $35 Million MORE. From the story:

""City attorneys are recommending aldermen settle up to avoid even larger court payouts in five cases. If approved, the payments will exacerbate the city’s looming budget problems.""

For what it's worth, the people getting these settlements were tortured by police and spent decades in prison for crimes they had no part in and were targeted because of the people they knew and the neighborhoods they lived in. 

Anyway. It's pretty gross. And the hell of it is, it's not like any of this made chicago safer. When you hear folks talk about ""the good old days"" or whatever of Mayor Daley... putting the wrong guy in prison means the guy who did it is still out there. blah blah blah.

Garbage dumping in englewood,"I moved to englewood this past summer with my boyfriend and our two dogs. It’s pretty quiet, our neighbors are generally pretty nice, and we love our apartment. Our only issue is all the garbage being dumped in the empty plots of land throughout the neighborhood, very obviously from people that do not live in our neighborhood. Most of it is construction garbage (drywall, rotted wood, etc all in industrial black bags) but theres also occasionally excessive bags of regular trash or landscape clippings. A lot of our neighbors tie plastic bags to their fence to avoid littering, so small trash is not usually a problem, its people loading their cars/trucks up and dumping them. My boyfriend wants to speak to the alderman but I want to know if theres anything more that we can do? Englewood gets such a bad rap when in reality its not what it used to be, its just a community of people that are maybe not all doing the best financially but most people we encounter are truly so nice or just mind their business.

We Have Exactly One Week to Fix the Trump Tower Chicago Fish-Kill Settlement,"After over a decade of knowingly decimating fish in the Chicago River, the Trump Organization has managed to negotiate a surprisingly deficient settlement that benefits itself. But if we push for some simple changes during the public comment period, it could much better serve wildlife and Chicagoans.  
**About me:** I've worked or volunteered for several ecology-focused nonprofits, including one of the two involved in this litigation, but what I'm writing doesn't necessarily reflect the views of any organizations I've been with, even if it very much reflects the views of a whole lot of people within those organizations. I'm not affiliated with LVEJO, which I mention below.

**Background:** When Trump Tower was built 17 years ago, it included an air conditioning system that pulls in water from the Chicago River to help cool the building. Those systems can be ok, but Trump's cut corners in both design and operation. The water it releases is far too hot, but more importantly, the system has been trapping and killing a ridiculous amount of fish and other wildlife ever since it was installed. Seven years ago, the Sierra Club conducted a permit review and then sued the Trump Organization for operating this giant fish-killing machine without a permit. Then last year, a judge finally ruled that the Trump Organization was violating environmental laws. 

Chicago environmental circles expected a settlement where the Trump Organization pays $5 to10 million into an Illinois state trust fund, with the Illinois EPA issuing grants from that fund to improve the health of the Chicago River. But in the proposed settlement that's currently open for public comment, the Trump Org agrees to pay only $4.8 million, with $3 million going to ""restoring the Chicago River habitat for fish and aquatic life."" And 100% of that $3 million is dedicated to projects improving and beautifying the small stretch of downtown river closest to Trump Tower. Many other projects--projects that don't have the funding options that downtown already had--would much better benefit both Chicago River wildlife and the public.

**Problems with the settlement:**

1. It's not enough money.
2. The money could be spent more efficiently to benefit the Chicago River's ecology and Chicagoans--not just the mainstem of the river where Trump Tower is located. 

**What's in the current proposal:** Costs have to be reported to the Illinois EPA, but there isn't much oversight or specificity for what ""restoring the Chicago River habitat for fish and aquatic life"" must look like. It's anticipated that it will be a bunch of bundles of floating logs for turtles to bask on, and submerged structures that hope to attract and provide habitat for fish and other wildlife. There are some questions around whether that type of project is the most beneficial, and big questions around why a project of that type would require all $3 million. But the biggest issue with the project is actually the location. 

**Why the location matters:** At first it may make sense that this money would focus on the part of the Chicago River closest to Trump Tower, since that's where the violations took place. But the first thing to understand is that the Chicago-Calumet River System is a heavily integrated system with few barriers. Once you make it past the electric barriers near Lemont, you are in a system of over 150 miles of heavily connected canals, streams, and rivers without a bunch of significant barriers, like large waterfalls. Fish can, and do, move freely throughout this system during their lifetimes. This was generally understood for a long time, but in the last few years scientists at the Shedd Aquarium have repeatedly confirmed it. Their fish-tracking studies have shown that Chicago River fish frequently make long multi-mile trips along the river system, and sometimes even between the lake and the river. Because of this, improving the habitat for fish in one area can benefit their numbers throughout the system. **In these situations, the most cost-effective improvements are generally ""worst-first,"" meaning the dirtiest areas where toxins are actively leaching out and harming wildlife should be first priority.** 

* The small stretch of river near Trump Tower is less than 1% of the river system, and it's possibly the cleanest stretch of the river already, due to the constant influx of clean lake water into the area. In many other areas of the Chicago River, remediation could have a huge benefit: taking an area that's too toxic for most wildlife due to an industrial past, and transforming it into welcoming productive habitat. You'll never see that kind of improvement in the mainstem, since it's already so clean. 
* This may also be the absolute worst place to put these types of structures in the whole of the Chicago-Calumet River System, due to the risk of future fish entrainment and impingement (the thing Trump Tower is doing now). That's because this downtown stretch of the river is filled with other large buildings with similar air conditioning systems using river water. While none are as dangerous as Trump Tower's has been, they all pose some risk to fish, especially smaller, younger fish. Encouraging fish to spend more time and probably nest/spawn specifically near these baby-fish-killing-machines may not be the best idea, and it'd be better to build these structures literally anywhere else in the river system. 

**What's a better idea?** $3 million could fundamentally improve parts of the Chicago River and those nearby communities. And $3 million could fund multiple projects in different areas that need attention. 

It's hard to say what part of the Chicago River System is in the worst condition right now. At certain points it could have been the area around Goose Island or Bubbly Creek, with their manufactured gas plants and stockyards. But remediation of those places is being actively pursued already, for example by forcing Peoples Gas to fund remediation of their old sites and designating several areas superfund sites. 

In my opinion, the area most in need of remediation is the heavily polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon polluted spur of the river that pokes into the Little Village neighborhood, officially called Collateral Channel. The Little Village Environmental Justice Organization (LVEJO) has been trying for well over a decade to get Collateral Channel remediated. They tried to get MWRD to fix it, since they originally dug the channel. But so far, all LVEJO has been able to do is get some fencing up to protect the neighborhood kids from playing near the toxic waters. LVEJO has a proven track record of spearheading major lasting improvements to the built environment in Little Village, including their recent work at La Villita Park immediately north of Collateral Channel. La Villita Park is great, but in the summer the smell from Collateral Channel drifts over it. 

**To get a sense of what this amount of money can do:** Just $1.5 million would probably be enough to fund clay cap remediation of the Collateral Channel, leaving plenty of money for the kind of biopark and community boat launch they've been trying to get funded for the past decade: [https://www.facebook.com/share/1AiEbxpdzF/](https://www.facebook.com/share/1AiEbxpdzF/) 

**How to fix this settlement proposal:** You can read the proposed settlement and make a comment during the next 7 days here: [https://epa.illinois.gov/public-notices/npdes-settlement-notices.html](https://epa.illinois.gov/public-notices/npdes-settlement-notices.html) We the people are represented by the Illinois Attorney General's office in this case. The AG is required to consider our comments and can withdraw from the settlement and request changes if our comments show this settlement would be ""inappropriate, improper, or inadequate."" If you contact other elected officials or media, it could help put pressure on Kwame Raoul's AG office to change the settlement.

**What should we ask for:** Negotiating a higher payout at this point in the process would be a big ask. Improving how that money is allocated is more likely. Here's what I propose we ask for, and notes on why it matters:

* That the $3 million dollars go to an independent grantmaker like the Illinois EPA or the City of Chicago's River Ecology and Governance Task Force, and that the funds could then be awarded to the project or projects most likely to improve the ecology of the Chicago River System as a whole. 
* The current settlement designating all the money for the mainstem downtown doesn't make any sense from an ecological perspective, and it's especially insulting given that the area already has plenty of options to fund these kinds of projects. For example: Just after Trump Tower was built, $100 million federal loan was all spent improving the riverwalk in the mainstem area around the tower, and that was on top of massive other public and private investments to that small section of the river. Other neighborhoods along our river, like Little Village, don't have those same funding options.
* The Trump family has a long history of repeatedly using money intended to benefit the public or charities on Trump's own properties. Given that context, it's all the more upsetting that this proposed settlement would devote all remediation funding to the areas near Trump Tower.

Immigrant Story,"When my grandfather passed away a few years ago we found this letter in his papers.  My great-grandmother wrote this in 1969, and I transcribed it exactly as written.

&gt;My Story  
&gt;  
&gt;When I was 13 years old I had to leave the village where we lived in a very small farming town near Kiev, Russia. Because of the anti-semetic ""programs"", our parents felt that our lives were in danger because the kossak soldiers were raiding the villages and beating jews and burning their houses. Two of my older brothers and two of my older sisters had already escaped to the United States where they had earned enough money to send some to my family so that they could buy a boat ticket to cross the ocean. All of this happened very long ago but I can still remember the horror of having to leave my Mother and Father and my other brothers and sisters expecting to never see them again as long as I lived. Being a farm girl and relatively uneducated, I really had no idea of how many thousands of miles I had to travel before the joy of seeing my relatives in the United States again.  
&gt;  
&gt;I was to travel with a neighbor couple and we had to escape in the middle of the night to avoid being seen by the authorities. I remember that we had to walk for many hundreds of miles nearly always at night. I was very cold at night because I had no warm clothes, to carry and we sometimes could not find the shelter of a barn when the weather was bad. We were always afraid of being seen by the soldiers or the police and being thrown into jail or worse. I remember being very hungry because most of what we ate had to be found on the land we were passing. Sometimes some kind people would help us and let us sleep where it was warm and give us some food. I was very small but I was very strong from working on the farm and this permitted me to keep up with the people I was walking with. After a very long time I remember seeing the large ships and ocean for the very first time. We were put in ""steerage"" which is the very bottom section of the large ship. It seemed like thousands of us were crowded together with hardly any room to move. When the boat finally left the port nearly everybody got seasick and the smell was terrible. We could go up and get some air, but it was too cold much of the time.  One night there was an awful storm and there was so many children crying that I was even more frightened. After many days we were able to see the shoreline of the United States and eventually the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour. I cannot describe to thrill and relief that I felt at that magnifiscent sight. There were also all those high buildings even back then before World War I. They let us off the ship at Ellis Island where doctors examined us and we were asked questions in our own language. I could not speak English at all. I had to wear a big tag which gave some information about me and instructed the authorities to get me on a train from New York to Chicago where my brothers and sisters were living. It was all so bewildering, frightening and exhausting. On the train I was unable to talk to anyone who understood me. When I finally arrived in Chicago there was no one at the train station to meet me! That was the last straw and I really broke down and cried. Fortunately, there was a Travelers Aid Society in the station looking for these poor, frightened people and they comforted me and gave me something to eat. Just about then my family arrived and there was much happy crying and hugging. They had misunderstood the instructions and gone to the wrong train station. You can only imagine the joy of seeing familiar faces of loved ones and being able to communicate with them after all those weeks of uncertainty and many thousands of miles traveled by a 13 year old child.  
&gt;  
&gt;I have never forgotten the blessing of this wonderful land of opportunity and freedom. We all studied hard and learned the language as fast as we could. My brothers became doctors and we all valued education very highly. I never saw my Mother and Father again, but I did get to see the sisters and brothers I had left behind when I traveled to the old country about 60 years later. It just confirmed how blessed we were to live in the United States of America.

She lived and died in Chicago, sadly before I was born.  She had a wonderful life and raised a family, none of whom can fathom what it must have been like to flee pogroms as a 13 year old and somehow make it to Chicago by foot, steerage, and train. 

I thought of sharing this with everyone today because yesterday while the weather was so beautiful, I got to help stop a young Venezuelan immigrant from jumping off a bridge.  When myself and another helpful bystander were trying to talk him out of trying for a third time, we asked him what we could get him, thinking the answer might be water or food or money.  And through his shaking and tears, he said ""work"".

There's a line from the Hebrew bible we read every week at Shabbat services that goes: *""When a foreigner resides with you in your land, you must not oppress him. You must treat the foreigner living among you as native-born and love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.""*

We know Greg Abbott doesn't believe in anything like this, but surely the idea resonates with Christians, Muslims, Atheists, and everyone who adheres any moral code at all?  Virtually all of us had family that were foreigners in this land.

Neighborhoods to consider for an out of state graduate student,"Hey Folks!  
I am looking for some inputs on which neighborhoods to consider to rent an apartment while I stay in Chicago for a year. My situation is that I am an out of state graduate student and will be staying in Chicago for a year. Being a student my budget is really tight and I am ideally looking for a 2 bed or 3 bed apartment with a monthly rent of $400 - 600. Furthermore, I want the neighborhood hood to be peaceful with access to gyms and opportunities to socialize with young professionals.  


Based on my research thus far, I should avoid south of China Town. However, from what I see,that does not leave me with much neighborhoods that are safe and within my budget. Ideally, I will not like to go any further north than Wicker park and any further than west of  West Town.

Do you have any suggestions into what neighborhoods I should consider given my criterion.

Thanks in advance for any help/inputs.

open letter from a chicago gang member/ama,"this is written poorly so bear with me if your interested

what's up yall....i'm gonna start this off with some info upon myself, i found reddit a couple months back in the summer when i was looking up fl studio techniques (/r/flstudio) and i've been really amused by the diversity and structure of this site, i spend alot of my time on here learning about things i'd otherwise be unfamiliar with but i typically stick to /r/makinghiphop /r/hiphopheads /r/islam /r/trees and /r/iama

i'm from the south woodlawn area of chicago, a specific block known as the 'mecca' in the vicinity of marquette and blackstone (rightfully named) down the block from mt. carmel high/hyde park high/jackson park. this area has been strictly black p stone since the 70s....some of my kinfolk are blood related to the honorable likes of chief eugene hairston, melvin bailey, and   lamar bell.

i'd like to consider the blackstones among the wiser more righteous gangs in the land but this varies quite much.....you have sets like mine called the mecca.....then you got sets that pride themselves by the name terrortown or slaughtertown so you can use your imagination with that shit. original black p. stone ranger doctrine advises against unneccasary violence, promotes moorish identity and promotes reflection of truth, justice and freedom.

heres where my open letter comes in place: things are different my friends, this is a new era of chicago gangsterism. in the 90's violence occured over pride, money, identity, essentially always had a (often very arguable) purpose......nowadays that doesn't matter. these young cats (15-21) get to listening to /r/drillandbop and get gun happy. i've seen cats shoot each other over miniscule amounts of money. seen cottage grove cats shoot irrelevant humboldt park cats for bearing different flags (foolishness). my advice to you all are if you see gang activity avoid it. i see alot of these young hipster that get to gentrifying thinking shit is sweet, trying to take pictures, be friendly etc etc.....a few months back i had a white guy walk up to me at the walgreens on 67th and get real friendly ""are you a vice lord? have you ever killed somebody? do you sell crack?"".....if that was somebody 5 years younger then me that might have ended badly. i read a book a while back called gang leader for a day, some of y'all might be familiar with that literature......that shit is a fairy tale, especially in this era of chief keefs, king yellas, etc etc...don't try that shit. also, white people, dont try buying drugs from people clearly affiliated with gangs, thats how you get mugged. if you try buying drugs off an open market (without prior communication/from a stranger) i reccomend only spending half of what you intend, then if the first transaction is smooth, continue at your discretion. if there are any youngins that go to mount carmel.....don't walk south.....dont try and hang out at the restaraunts and what not when you should be in school or after dark. its atleast 10 highschool kids in my neighborhood that don't acquire knowledge at hyde park like they should....back in the late 90's i MYSELF used to have fun with you cats.....imagine what my youngins would do. mind your own business, enjoy yourself and chicago is the most beautiful city in america, snow or not.

i say all this because my intent is to promote positivity and peace, the reddit community is very unique and even if you weren't i believe each individual on here serves a purpose, don't let some young kids power trip or thirst for money disrupt that.

now i encourage you to AMAa (ask me almost anything), but bear in mind what i admire about reddit is its open and diverse community, if i, a damn gang member can fly on this site, i imagine 10 off-duty CPD deputies are too, so be realistic with your questions.

proof: if a moderator wishes i can send him pictures or write him portions of the black p. stone doctrine privately. i will NOT send pictures of my face, friends faces; street signs; anything remotely identifying myself or my location, or anything else incriminating or subject to gang injuctions

"Hi Chicagoans, I'm moving over to your lovely city from Australia and am looking for some tips!","First things first, why am I moving to Chicago? Well essentially I'm just taking the plunge and moving over for fun, adventure and a change of scenery. I love America and figured I'd give living there a shot! I don't know anyone in Chicago and have never been there, but it sounds like a happening place and from what I can deduce, pretty much epitomises the 'America' I want to experience.  

By way of background I've been on holidays to NYC, DC and LA so if you feel like throwing in some comparisons that would be fantastic! 

Me: Mid-20s, male. 

So, some of the questions I have are:

1. Firstly, which ~~neighbourhoods~~ *neighborhoods* do you recommend I check out for accommodation (I'd like to be within walking distance from 'stuff to do', I'm in my 20's and I estimate my budget will be about $1000 p/m)?
1. On that point, what are the best websites for finding accommodation? 
1. What is the job market like (I've experience in media relations/consultancy as well as hospitality management/bar tending)?
1. Again, are there any websites you would recommend for finding work? 
1. Are there Chicago quirks I should be aware of before I move over (i.e. ~~neighbourhoods~~ *neighborhoods* to avoid, things not to say, tourist traps)? 
1. Do you have any recommendations for things I should see or do in my first few weeks?
1. Finally, anything else you think I should know?

*Thanks in advance for your tips! Looking forward to arriving.*

Edit 1: Thanks so much for all the responses. This has been *really* helpful. It's been great to compare these comments with stuff I've read on the Internet. Also, thanks for those who have PM'd me offering advice. 

Edit 2: So now I want to leave and come over right now... You guys have been more helpful than all the Googling in the world. Nothing better that advice from the people on the ground. I'd be great if you guys could up vote the comments that provided comprehensive responses, as I feel this info would be hugely useful to anyone moving over!

For example section B-2 states that it's illegal to fly directly over any person who is not involved in the operation of the small unmanned aircraft, without such person's consent; and section B-3 states that it's illegal to fly  over property that the operator does not own, without the property owner's consent, and subject to any restrictions that the property owner may place on such operation; which includes all park district property.

Can we discuss Down-zoning?,"So I live in the Avondale neighborhood right by where the raucous [Alderman Rosa meeting occurred last week] (). My problem is that after reading a variety of articles, and going through some of Rosa's [Community Driven Zoning and Development](http://www.aldermancarlosrosa.org/cdzd)  (it's kinda long),  I can't really get a handle on if if I think Down-zoning is a good idea or a bad one. I'll list the pros and cons as I can see them, though I know I'm missing key parts of the debate (I'll update as more info comes in):

**Pros**

* Lot by lot control of new construction creates opportunity for building better integrated (services and population) neighborhoods

* Possibly protects against over-development and gentrification 

* Preserves quasi-historic aspects of a neighborhood particularly small businesses

* Allows the alderman to cherry pick projects that appeal to their base


**Cons**

* Property owners lose control of how to sell or develop their property (I think this might affect both large developers like Fishman as well as individual property owners ready to ""cash-out""

* Assumes that property rates will continue to increase and development money will always be there

* Assumes the 'character' of the street or neighborhood is worth preserving (the [stretch of Milwaukee in question] (https://chicago.curbed.com/2017/10/12/16464692/milwaukee-avenue-development-downzoning-avondale) is a dump, IMO)

* Assumes that gentrification can be curbed or stopped

* Allows the alderman to cherry pick projects that appeal to their base

* Increases political power of an elected official with little oversight

* Seems to view the problems of the future through the lens of the past.


**Some questions**

* Is gentrification and cultural identity actually the biggest issue we need to worry about? For example, should we be building for better sustainability or specific types of businesses?

* What are the future prospects of the neighborhood or Chicago writ large?

*What types of migration can we expect to see over the next 10-20 years (i.e. more young professionals? more immigrants? more internal migration?)

* What can the tax base support? What are we losing if we don't open the neighborhood up to larger developments?
 


Please, avoid emotionally-charged political rhetoric, I'd like to actually understand the issues. If you have a stake in one side or the other, I think that's important, but not a reason to assume your opinion is morally superior. Be charitable and assume that people have valid, rational opinions that they have thought about. Thanks.

Question about commuting downtown via metra from south suburbia,"Howdy south suburban friendos!

I could use your help planning my Metra commute downtown.

I reside in Crestwood and currently taking SWS line downtown for work. A month ago SWS line had an issue where all scheduled trains were canceled and I was forced to take RI line home. After realizing that RI stops almost closer to my home than SWS, I figured I could just try and take RI or even ME to work.

Here are my questions:

* Any of you take RI line downtown from blue island station? Is it safe? How much is parking at the station? It looks like certain trains are slower and/or faster than others. How does that work?
* Also, looking at the map, it looks like ME line is also very close to the Blue island RI stop. How does that work? Is it the same station? Or is ME station further out? Do tickets work on both lines? Also looks like ME is suuuuuper slow and there are a ton of stops. Is there a way to avoid those stops?

Any info would be highly appreciated!

Many thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: After reading some nice comments (thank you!) I decided to get in my car and go check the area out. Blue island looks like such a cool neighborhood. There are several parking lots and looks like you have to pay for them via the Passport app. I saw $1.25 or $1.50 parking rate signs. Area was empty on a Saturday but I would imagine it should be busier on a workday. Also, as one person mentioned, if boarding from Blue island station, you have a choice of RI or ME which is nice in case one of the lines suffer some kind of issue.

In the wake of all the car jackings and traffic in the city I'm surprised that a bike only neighborhood pilot program.,"I've went down to the loop and various L ""suburban"" stops like California on the Pink line, Western on the Blue line and Southport on the Brown Line. When you arrive at the stop(s) typically there is a divvy station within a block of the staton and a handful of mixed regular bikes/e-bikes is there to rent. The problem with this is that ""sure you could ride your bike everywhere but your competing with cars and little bike lane support."" I will say that compared to years in the past when divvy wasn't so huge and wasn't on every corner, right now the bike network is fine. 

My proposed idea is to have a certain neighborhood (whatever that may be) be fully dedicated to bicycles to lessen congestion, improve local health and lower cost of living. Cars in areas like these shouldn't have to take up a sizeable amount of income per household to make a living or even to sustain a family. For deliveries to businesses (or to consumers) they would use a cargo bike to deliver like [dhl does](https://www.dhl.com/us-en/home/press/press-archive/2019/dhl-rolls-out-its-cubicycle-in-new-york-city-participating-in-new-pilot-program-to-test-the-use-of-cargo-bikes-to-alleviate-traffic-congestion.html). In some of the streets that have one ways like W Newport Ave that is a one way with cars parked on both sides, for the bike side of this it could be a two way bike lane with on street bike parking/racks for each house. Reduced carjackings (get rid of cars have no carjackings amirite? /s) while this wouldn't stop anyone from stealing bikes or robbing people for their bikes it would lower the profit margin that someone could make for reselling a bike as compared to a car, also they wouldn't be able to run as far (or as dangerously) as compared to a car that was stolen that is on the run. Promoting community health instead of driving a vehicle that puts out noxious fumes that idles for a huge amount of time in stopped traffic, but also lowering general global warming in that area (as per extensive amount of research).

I like the neighborhood for its good and bad aspects, but am hesitant to put in an offer just yet, in part due to all the horror stories I've heard about the Blue Line during rush hour (i.e. the top post in this thread: [Why is the blue line so comically bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/am3chs/why_is_the_blue_line_so_comically_bad/))

On the plus side, my job *is* flexible enough so that I could commute early, like 6-7 AM, and leave work around 3 PM. Would this avoid the worst of the rush?

How fucked is the Divison stop in the morning around ~7AM? I realize this stop might probably be one of the worst, since people don't really start getting off until Chicago, Grand and finally the mass exodus at Clark/Lake.

And coming home at around 3 PM or 4 tops -- would getting on at Washington or even heading down to Monroe be doable?

How much worse is the crowding in the winter vs. the summer at the above mentioned stops?

As a last resort, I could drive if needed; but that seems a bit wasteful. I can also work from home on occasion, like if the Blue Line is just completely down/delayed as I know happens sometimes.

I hope there's a solid Blue Line ridership who check this sub, looking for anyone who has a similar situation or can offer any advice. Thanks!",chicago,11,1551197337.0,47,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/av13eq/thinking_of_moving_to_wicker_park_and_relying_on/
Drivers: I love you. I look out for you. I am one of you sometimes. But PLEASE understand these things about cyclists and drive safer.,"1. You are not always going to be faster than a cyclist, and you do not always need to pass us. I ride on the Glenwood Greenway a lot - a low speed neighborhood street with parking on either side and a ton of speed bumps and stop signs. It is not hard to go faster than cars - who have to slow all the way down at the speed bumps - on this street (or on a lot of neighborhood streets). However, I will regularly have cars accelerate to pass me, only to have them slam on the brakes as they approach a stop sign or speed bump. Maintaining a normal speed, I can have a back and forth like this with a car a few times before they finally get off the street or I get clear of them. Patience is a virtue. Look ahead to see what’s coming. Will passing that cyclist really get you where you want to go sooner? If not, don’t do it. You’ll save some gas avoiding the acceleration, too. 

2. Check your mirror/blind spot or use the [Dutch reach](https://youtu.be/GzIf80eSfCg) before opening your door to get out of your car. I’ve been doored before, and it sucks (got the scar to prove it). 

3. Use your signals. The best way to be safe on the road is to be predictable. The bike lane is almost always on your right. Cyclists will pass you on your right if they think you are going straight. 

4. Know your hand signals. Left arm extended = left turn. Left arm bent up at 90 degrees or right arm extended = right turn. 

5. Streets are a shared resource. If you’re frustrated by cyclists on the road, understand that some “annoying” things cyclists do are defensive. Riding farther out in the road to take up the lane lets us be more visible and avoid getting doored. Riding in groups makes us more visible and provides safety in numbers. 

6. Cyclists would much rather not be riding in the street with cars, too. We should all be advocating for more off-street and protected bike infrastructure.",chicago,0,1623068937.0,33,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/nubbld/drivers_i_love_you_i_look_out_for_you_i_am_one_of/
What can a helmet do?,"Pardon the cheesy title...but it's time for some real talk. 

Some of the streets of Chicago can be dangerously deadly, and there is minimum support for many CPS students with budgets constantly being tightened.

I am visiting Chicago for a week in October. Where do you suggest I stay during that time?,"My stay will be from October 14th to the 21st.  I am traveling alone but will also meeting up with a friend or two who live in the city.  I already have my plane ticket booked and now am just focusing on the best place to stay during my time there.  I am open to anything (Hotel, Motel, other. etc.) The following factors are important to me, ranking in terms of importance to most to least:

Safety:  I'm told Chicago's bad rep with safety is overblown and that outside of the bad neighborhoods, the city is mostly fine.  Obviously, I don't want to be in or close to one of those bad areas.  

Good location:  One of my favorite things to do when visiting big cities is to walk around, take in the sites, and enjoy the vibes.  I'm sure I will be spending a good deal of time in my hotel/motel/etc., so a good area, even if just for that, would be ideal.  Any potential proximity to attractions, things to see, and great restaurants are always a plus.

Affordability:  Obviously, I don't want to skimp to the point of the area being dangerous or uninhabitable.  I'm not struggling financially right now and have budget my money appropriately to enjoy this vacation.  However, any suggestions that don't break the bank would be appreciated.  I don't need luxury, as I will probably do little more than relax after a long day and sleep there.

If you need any further information that would help you make a more informed suggestion, I can answer it.  

And while this is not why I came here, I am always open to any suggestions someone might have in seeing the city.  I am doing my research, but always appreciate the help!

Thank you for your help!   Looking forward to visiting the city again soon.  I visited for a family trip in Middle School, but haven't done my adult trip yet, so I'm very excited.  Plus, only a 45 minute plane ride from Minnesota, so that part will be nearly painless.

1.  Living anywhere near downtown is basically impossible.  If the price tag doesn't ruin you, the taxes will.  I'm not saying it's not worth it, it's just that we're not wealthy.
 
Living North of the loop, prices stay relatively outrageous until you get up near O'Hare.  The reason for this seems to be the low crime rate.  It seems like I can afford to live in a garden unit of some buildings, but even then, I'm still at the top of my price range.
 
2.  Living South of the loop gets hairy... fast.  The prices are much more reasonable, but according to the various crime data maps, these are much more dangerous areas.  Additionally, they don't offer the type of lifestyle we would like (walking to restaurants and groceries. Very little driving.)
 
3.  Super far south, we could live in a mansion (literally) and almost buy it cash.  Taxes are low.  We would have access to both the Green and Red lines as well as a garage for our car(s). And the crime stats are scary.

How safe is Lawndale for a concert?,"My 17 year-old son wants to go with a few friends to the Lyrical Lemonade Summer Bash concert at Douglas Park in Lawndale at the end of June.

Please, no generalizations and assumptions about it being the west side of Chicago.  I’m looking for first-hand insight from people who know the area.

Update:  We’re going to let him go as long as he adheres to some ground rules:

1. No driving/parking &amp; no public transpo - they have get a ride there and back from a reliable, trustworthy adult.  Found out the mom of one of his friends drove last year.  They need to arrange something like that again.
2. They have to be aware of their surroundings and help each other steer clear or walk away from any situations with people who are being aggressive.  Not the time to prove you’re not a punk.
3. Phone - leave the house at 100% and no burning battery life on stupid shit - and be responsive to a few check-ins.  
4. They need to be at a designated pick up spot 100% on time.

Final update:
Thanks to all who contributed constructive feedback from first-hand experience in the Douglas Park area. Our son and several of his friends went to the concert and had a blast. Our son said Sunday (second day of the event) was the best day of his life.

"Help r/chicago! I'm moving to Evanston and need advice beyond what's in the ""read before posting"" post.","Hi Everybody!

So I'm about to move from Georgia to the Chicagoland area for work.  I got offered my dream job in Deerfield (no, not at Walgreens).  I can find some decent looking places in the suburbs to rent in my price range, but as a 29 year-old, single guy I imagine that would be pretty soul-crushing. 

The problem is, sitting in traffic coming from the city seems equally as soul-crushing.  I'd love to live in the city, but I have a pretty low spending range, and it seems like most of what I can afford is pretty ugly looking.  Couple that with the drive, and I'm not sure I want to move there.  So I'm trying to figure out what Evanston might be like.  I've driven down Green Bay road before, and it seems like I can take that straight from Evanston to work in about 30 minutes, which isn't too bad.  

So what I need help with is figuring out how to make this work.  What's life like in Evanston for a late 20's single guy? Does Evanston have a decent dating scene for people who don't go to NU (and who maybe aren't interested in dating 20 year-olds)? **And more importantly**, where in Evanston should I be looking?  I've been saving some money for the last 2 years hoping to get this job, and I can use that to boost what I can afford up to ~1,350 after all utilities and parking are included.  But, obviously, the farther under that cap I stay, the more money I can spend on my social life.  

That said, I'd love to find something with a decent amount of space and that seems reasonably well kept.  I've looked at a lot of apartments already where there's the gaps between the wall and the floor, or where the interior doesn't seem to have been updated in 50 years.

So throw me your advice. Tell me what parts of town might be helpful, what parts to stay away from.  Which management companies are good and which to avoid.  I'll take any help you can throw my way, and I'll really appreciate it.

"Neighborhoods for 40+, No Kids","We're a 40-something married couple with two dogs, no kids, probably moving to Chicago this summer. We moved to Brooklyn from Austin, TX and I do not love it. My Slampiece loves it and likes city-living where as for me it sucks my energy dry. We need a good mix of walkability and city, but I also want to get in the car and go to the grocery store or Trader Joe's (I cook a lot). Also these dogs are killing me in an apartment and I feel like we need at least a pet relief area. One is old and won't be with us much longer, but I want her life to be awesome. Right now we have to carry her up and down the stairs about 6 times a day. 

We're coming out for our first scouting trip in a few weeks and I want to prioritize some neighborhoods to look at.

The details:
Renting for the first year or so, budget &lt;$2500 for 3 bedrooms or 2 plus a space for an office. (We both work from home so need individual spaces.)
No commute to consider other than to ORD, but can use Lyft to do that.
I would prefer a townhouse/house with a small pet relief area.
Washer/Dryer in unit, dishwasher too. Does Chicago have disposals? I want one of those too...
If it's an apt. can't be on the second floor (elderly dog can't do stairs)
Looking for walkability to stores, restaurants, parks, transit
Prefer to be in the city
We travel a lot, mostly from ORD
I'd like to have one car, fine with street parking but prefer a space of course
Racial/socioeconomic diversity
Feel safe walking in the very early morning if no outdoor space (elderly dog currently needs to go out at 4AM)
We don't do the bar scene because we old. 
Tend to be civic-minded, cook a lot, like to eat out a good bit, not huge sports fans, but will probably go to a Sox or Bulls game on occasion. 
I love a good park, and have a deep, deep love for sitting by/in a pool reading in the summer.

It feels like this is a pretty suburban list, but my slampiece doesn't want to do that for our first year if it can be avoided. When we buy, I'm thinking Western Suburbs will be the right fit.

Some neighborhoods I'm interested in and need feedback on:
Bronzeville
Hyde Park
Rogers Park
Andersonville
Ukranian Village
Logan Square
Pilsen

LakeFrontTrail Guidelines. Please Post More Best Practices.,"It's Dangerous out there.  I've seen way too many accidents and collisions.

Most accidents can be avoided like this:

1)Utilize the furthest to the right you can run/bike/skate.  At all moments, you should be actively looking to be at the furthest right you can be.  Naturally some prefer to run on the trail, some don't.  That's OK, but cyclists, don't pass people on the inside unless of emergency.  It confuses and creates problems.

2)Run in single file or extremely close side-by-side.  If your side-by-side takes up an entire lane, don't run like that.  If you are jogging at peak times, there's no excuse.  Unless you're cruising at 6 minute miles, people, bicycles and skaters will risk themselves to get around you.  Want to run side-by-side?  Fine, go on off hours or stay away from the ""strip"" (Belmont-Oak)

3) Look behind you before you cross. I almost killed a runner last year, going slowly, when he was cutting the path to get to the Oak Street underpass and didn't look behind him... which leads me to my final, and I'm sure most controversial point.

4) Leave Your Headphones at Home. Seriously. If you must wear them at least have them on low. The example I used above, when I almost killed that kid, I SHOUTED at him but he can't hear me since he had his music turned too loud. They're a safety hazard for you and everyone else.

How dangerous is the area around 79th Street &amp; Dan Ryan Expressway?,I just got a job at the corner of 79th and S Vincennes Ave (about 3 blocks west of the expressway) and I don't have a car so I would have to rely entirely on public transportation which would drop me off at the expressway from which I would have to walk the next 3 blocks to work at 6am.

Exactly how dangerous is Englewood?,"We only hear so much awful stuff that takes place in Englewood.

But, after reading the recent article about the new business that opened in Englewood, I became curious to know exactly what it's like in Englewood and wondered if maybe I could visit that new business without fear or worry of being harmed.

Is it possible to do a AMA with a concealed carry licensee in Chicago?,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit. But, I would love to have a ""Ask Me Anything"" with one or more concealed carry license holders who are living and/or working in Chicago.

Edit: Added my questions here that I asked directly to the first poster. Plus, added a few more at the bottom.

* 1) Do you carry your gun everytime you leave home?
* 2) What motivated you to get the license?
* 3) How have your day to day activities changed since getting your license? Do you walk around later at night now or by yourself? In other words do you now take less care to avoid dangerous situations?
* 3) Does carrying a gun around alter your thoughts? Do you feel more relaxed or more nervous?
* 4) Have you ignored any ""no guns allowed"" signage? (Will understand if you don't want to answer this).
* 5) Have you had any situations where you thought ""I might have to use my gun""?

 New questions:


* 6) Have you consumed alcohol while carrying in a bar, a private party, wedding, etc? Were you ever drunk?
* 7) Do you carry your weapon at your place of employment? Do your coworkers know? Does your boss?
* 8) How often do you tell friends, acquaintances, or strangers that you are currently carrying with CCW? What's been the reaction? ",chicago,11,1455156697.0,27,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/456gsi/is_it_possible_to_do_a_ama_with_a_concealed_carry/

What was living in Humboldt Park during the 1960s-70s like?,"What was Humboldt Park like in the 1960s-70s?

My Dad spent the first 21 years of his life living in Humboldt Park, Chicago. Both of my Grandparents were Polish immigrants.  My Dad is the 5th of 6 kids and they all lived off of W Evergreen Ave.


Aside from a brief story about their house partially burning down while he was a boy, I don’t know much else about his hardships growing up, or what type of reoccurring dangers Humboldt Park brought to him.  He chooses not to talk about this with his kids. If I ask my Mom about what my Dad has told her, she always tells me to “ask your Dad.”  
My Dad left Humboldt Park in 1974/75.  

Here are some general historical tidbits I know about:
The 1966 Division st Riots. 
The Latin Kings were founded in Humboldt Park. 
Humboldt Park was once a predominately Polish neighborhood until it began transitioning to a Puerto Rican neighborhood during the years my Dad grew-up there. 

People close to my Dad have told me how Humboldt Park is/ was one of Chicago’s hardest neighborhoods, but not much else. I’ve recently become fascinated with learning more about it. 

I’m hoping people who grew-up in or lived in Humboldt Park during the 1960s and 1970s will share their specific stories and/ or descriptions of this neighborhood back then.

Same with people who know someone who called Humboldt Park home during this era and is willing to share those stories.  

I’m not looking for any specific point of view.  I’m hoping to get feedback from multiple races, nationalities, and genders to help gain a broader, multidimensional understanding of this Chicago neighborhood back then.  As far as I’m concerned, there are no wrong answers and no unwelcome viewpoints — I’m hoping for raw authenticity. 

I hope many will share their unfiltered memories/ anecdotes — no matter how lovely or ugly or vulgar they may be  — which will help me better grasp where my Dad grew-up.

Talk to me about the Northeast corner of Uptown?,"Hey guys!  I've read all the posts in the past two years that have dealt with Uptown, but most of the posts have been about staying out of the area between Lawrence and Wilson, or about the Buena Park area.  I'm currently eyeing an apartment near Foster and Sheridan (specifically, on Winona between Sheridan and inner LSD) and was wondering if anyone could tell me their views on the area.

I already used Every Block and have walked and driven around, and it seems pretty safe.  But does anyone who lives in/visits the area often have any other opinions?  Does the panhandling get too bad, or is it just one or two people per block?  Also, are the Berwyn and/or Argyle red line stops safe, or should I consider taking cabs home if I'm out past eleven?

For reference, I'm a woman in my mid-twenties and I'm not really physically intimidating, so if it isn't a safe place to be for that demographic, I'd really like to know.

Question about the suburbs,"I'm moving up to Chicago from WV sometime in June. I've been looking at a lot of apartments listed online, but haven't found any that have hit all of the right points. I've found some beautiful places in areas 20-40 minutes outside of Chicago, and I've realized that I like the idea of living in the suburbs more. That being said, I just have a few questions for the people that actually live up there.

1. I'm mainly looking for a 2-3 bedroom townhouse. Is it basically impossible to find one for the price of 1200 a month in a safe neighborhood? All of the ones that I find are at least 1400 a month, if not higher. I just want to make sure I'm not looking for something I will never find.

2. Which suburbs have open space and trees, are safe, but are close to shopping?

3. This isn't a suburb question, but my friends that live in Chicago keep telling me not to get a place in the south part of the city. Are there any south side areas that really aren't that bad, or would it be best to avoid it all. Also, I have looked at the crime maps of the city that were in the sidebar, but I just wanted hear what you all had to say.

Moving to Chicago from out of state: HELP!,"Hey guys, 

I am moving to Chicago from Arizona (I know, I know...) here in the next couple weeks for a new job in River North. Since I have never lived in a big city like this, I am a little nervous and have a ton of questions about moving, living, costs, safety, cars, etc...

-----------------------------------------------
**Information:**

I am 24 years old, wife is 26. We have a young puppy (1 year and 1 month) who needs a lot of exercise (Jack Russell - so possibly looking at areas near a park). As far as what we are looking for kind of varies. We are not huge into partying, but we do like going and checking out different events whether they are drinking related (beer festivals), farmers markets, museums, concerts, etc... We really like a lot of the local restaurants in our area currently (think high review semi-cheap places on Yelp). We currently are living in a 1Br1Ba apartment and are perfectly content with finding something similar in Chicago. 

We are looking for some sort of neighborhood that matches all of these things as much as possible (with decent ability to get to public transportation)

----------------------------------------------------

**Living:**

Based on our information, do you guys have any recommendations for neighborhoods? Which neighborhoods match us and for what reasons? 

We are planning on renting an Airbnb for the first 2ish weeks to get a lay of the land. Any locations we should avoid or check out immediately?

------------------------------------------------------

**Costs:**

What should we watch out for? Currently we are paying about 20% for rent, but will most likely be paying 25-30% for rent here in Chicago. Will this have a huge impact on standard of living, or is this just kind of offset in other areas?

------------------------------------------------------

**Car:**

The wife and I are planning on bringing a car (paid off) however most places we look warn against it. The primary use for the car would be travelling out of state to visit nearby areas for vacations here and there. What do you guys think about this? Is parking something that is pricy everywhere in Chicago or just downtown?

------------------------------------------------------

**Safety:** 

I know this section is probably controversial, because we hear about it all on the news. I know it's not as bad as it is made out to be but what are areas we should avoid looking for housing due to safety reasons?

------------------------------------------------------

Thank you guys in advance for the answers. I am really excited to start checking out the city and all of the good food!",chicago,0,1520275655.0,20,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/8288sn/moving_to_chicago_from_out_of_state_help/

Problems qualifying for an apartment - can someone give me advice about this weird situation?,"I'm currently in Chicago from out of state looking for an apartment, and it is not going well. I'm here through Saturday, and I'd like to get some insight from you guys if possible.

Here's the situation: I just graduated from school with a BA from a good school, and managed to do it with zero debt (a miracle, right?) AND money saved in the bank to cover rent/living expenses for a year up here. Moving to this city has been my dream since high school - I adore it. I don't have a job lined up yet, because my career center suggested that I move first and look second (it's hard to find entry level work as an out of state resident). I've applied to a few places and haven't heard anything back, which I know is typical. I've done ""everything right"" according to people I've talked to, but I cannot find a management company willing to rent to me. They won't allow my dad to cosign because I'm not a full time student, and they shut me out once I tell them I don't have a job. I don't really want to pay my rent up front because then I have no leverage if they really neglect my apartment after I move in... but that might be the only feasible option. Can anyone provide insight? What can I do in this situation - am I effectively screwed? Would it be better to find a short term furnished rental to pay up front, get a couple of part time jobs and then try to qualify on my own later? I've been lurking/posting here for a while, and haven't seen anything like this, so I hope it isn't a repeat question.

TL;DR: Recent grad from out of state has enough money in savings to cover expenses for a year, but no one will rent to me because I'm jobless and not a full time student.

Edit: Just wanted to give an update on the situation. I followed advice here and walked around some more to no avail. I also went to Chicago Apartment Finders and explained my situation (though I wanted to avoid going that route), but luckily they were really helpful! They found a place that would allow me to have a cosigner as a non-student, and I've put in an application - it's a really great place, too.

Question about how Chicagoans view UChicago,"Hey /r/Chicago,

I'm a high school senior from the east coast who will be attending the University of Chicago in the fall. Since being admitted in winter, I've casually come to this sub to see what goes on in my future home. 

I visited Chicago for the first time this past week and was absolutely blown away by everything. I love Hyde Park's suburban feel, along with its proximity to the Loop. Chicago feels like a great city for young people. Probably my favorite so far.

Something I wondered when I was away from UChicago's campus and around the loop area was how actually Chicagoans perceive the University and its students.

Do you guys think we are a bunch of pretentious snobs?

How many of the young people living around the loop went to Uchicago? (rough estimates of course)

Do Chicagoans who have never been associated with the University take pride in having a prestigious university with the city's name in it? 

Do you guys even care about the University at all?

Basically anything you have to say about the University's relations with city folk I want to hear!

All the best. 

Edit: One last question I had when I was driving through the rougher neighborhood W of campus: How do the inner city people in southside feel about having this university nearby. A fine university that almost no kids from the rough neighborhoods near it will attend. And a general request - do you have any suggestions of books/movies/tv shows to consume to better understand the rougher parts of S Side life/inner city in general. I know the University is its own secluded world and not very dangerous at all, but I want to learn more just out of pure interest and lack of current knowledge.

Monday CTA rant,"* My home stop is Wellington. About a month ago I tweeted @CTA (#CTAfails) that one of the doors at the Wellington stop has been broken for more than a year. As in it always has caution tape up blocking the door, and has had caution tape up continuously at least since 2013. So rather than fixing the door, they just keep reapplying caution tape. For at least a year. The week after I tweeted them the door was miraculously in service for the first time since I'd lived in this neighborhood. As of last week, the door is again apparently broken and has caution tape up again. What the fuck? Will you fix the fucking door? Does it take more than a year to fix a door?
* Got to Wellington station this morning; as is always the case when its rainy or snowy, the ground floor entrance was covered in a puddle of water. Wellington is apparently one of the newer stations. This isn't one of the stations from the 19th century, it was rebuilt in 2008. And yet it flood with a half inch of water any time its wet out. Who the fuck is responsible for this incompetent architecture? I have never been in any other commercial building where the tiny amount of moisture tracked in by people walking is enough to flood a building. As long as we're going to have machine politics and powerful unions that are hard to be kept accountable by traditional means, the other side of the coin is that the mayor is supposed to take whoever is accountable for this failure out back and shoot him in the head.
* Walked up to the Wellington platform; there's a CTA employee standing there doing nothing while the entire platform is covered in snow. This is 8:20am already. They could have finished shoveling the entirety of both platforms hours ago. What the fuck are they doing?
* Wait 5 minutes for a train to come... It's a Purple. Wait another 8 minutes for the Brown I need. 13 minute wait. According to the schedule, Brown line trains are supposed to come every 4-7 minutes. It hasn't been snowing for hours. There's no legitimate excuse for delays. There are trains that run in the mountains amidst 20 feet of snow there is no reason besides managerial incompetence that the L can't operate on schedule many hours after a blizzard is over.
* Arrived at my final station in the Loop. The stairs going down are **packed with ice** and incredibly dangerous. I am a young man and I usually run down these stairs 2 at a time, but today I was taking them sideways to get enough room to put my foot on each one amidst the packed snow and ice and afraid for my life the whole time. Old women use these stairs and they were honestly a death trap. Again, multiple employees sitting in the warmth of the station house doing absolutely nothing.

I have a friend who bought a house there a while back, and then ended up moving out of town.

My primary motivation for moving to East Garfield Park is money, I'm not starving, but saving $700-800 a month on rent would really help me build up my savings, pay off my car/student loans, put something away, etc.  I'm aware the EGP is more dangerous that many of the neighborhoods that people outside of Chicago know for being dangerous, such as Englewood and Austin.  I'm street smart, but I'm afraid of being the target of random violence.

I've done all of the preliminary steps, such as checking out the neighborhood at different times of the day, I've spoken with the neighbors, and I've checked out the crime stats online.

The area is best described as being sandwiched in between Near West Side and the Medical District, along the blue line. I also know to stay East of Western. I was looking at some apartments right north of Eisenhower, somewhere between Oakley and Loomis, on VanBuren.

Just wanted to see how people would weigh in on the area, since I'm finding it hard to judge since it's smack dab between two locales.

What are the differences and similarities between NY and Chicago?

Of course someone who has already made that transition or has lived in both locations would be best qualified to answer these questions, but all comments are welcome.

Thanks

3 Tips to Avoid Bike Theft,"I've been browsing http://chicago.stolenbike.org/ over the last few days, which is a great place to report if you lost a bike.  One of my friend's had his stolen so I wanted to post a few things I've learned and see if anyone else had anything else.  

After browsing dozens of lost reports here are the 3 best tips:

-DON'T use a cable lock.  85-90% of the lost bike reports I read were from cable locks.  Buy a good u-lock.

-Don't lock bikes together.  You might think there's safety in numbers but to a bike thief it just means double the profits for half the work.  

-If you put your bike somewhere ""safe"" like a GARAGE, PORCH or SHARED CLOSET, lock it up, even if you ""have trustworthy neighbors"" or live in ""a safe area"" (both quotes I read from people in denial that their bike got stolen by someone in their own neighborhood who noticed the bike wasn't locked).  As far as the garage goes, it's easy to break into a garage, happen regularly, and bikes are a prime target for swindling.  

Those are the 3 biggest I've noticed.  Any other tips?  ",chicago,9,1374705932.0,22,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1izlqi/3_tips_to_avoid_bike_theft/

"r/Chicago, are you having problems with AT&amp;T data service downtown?","**TL;DR**: AT&amp;T needs to fix their network in their home town. Help me convince them to.

Here is my story. On New Years Day, my wife and I went to Apple to upgrade our iPhone 3Gs to the 4S. We previously had no problems with our service (except for Chinatown, specifically on the Orange Line between Roosevelt and Halsted)

With my new iPhone in hand, I was hoping to continue checking out Reddit and such on my commute. I was mistaken. I work one block away from the AT&amp;T HQ. My phone shows 4 to 5 bars and 3G. Yet, all of my applications either say I am not connected to the internet or time out. Always. My phone does not start working properly until I am passed Halsted. So obviously there are issues downtown.

I talked with tech support both on the phone and in store. I got a gamut of possible problems, but no definitive answers.

""The towers in your area may be being upgraded.""

""There are a lot of buildings around.""

""There is a high amount of traffic in the area.""

""This is Apple's problem. (My favorite)""

All of these excuses are unacceptable. I am paying out the wazoo for a data plan I cannot use but for the few hours I am at home, when I would use my laptop for internet anyway?! What is that shit?

Has anyone else been dealing with these issues? I am considering sending a petition to corporate demanding these issues be fixed. I would like to have some people with similar problems backing me up.

If you are experiencing these issues, comment with the model phone you have, the neighborhood(s) you experience the problem in, how long you have had this issue, and any other info you think would be relevant.

**EDIT** If you have no issues with AT&amp;T data in the area and do NOT use an iPhone, please tell me what phone you DO have. If worse comes to worst, I want to make sure I get a new phone that will work.

**EDIT2** Looks like its a unanimous issue with iPhone 4/4S users in the Loop / West Loop / River North. As mandrsn1 said:
&gt; My personal opinion (as a former antenna/radio engineer) is that iPhones have a strong preference for a specific portion of the radio band. Thus, all iPhones are trying to use the same portion of the spectrum, making that bit very clogged. There is plenty of spectrum that the iPhone is avoiding, thus non-iPhones have unclogged frequencies on which to operate.

So it looks like we got three options:

1. Suck it up. AT&amp;T doesn't care enough to acknowledge the problem or indicate they are fixing it. (Requires AT&amp;T to do nothing, even profiting from those who pay for a service they cannot use. $$$ in AT&amp;T pockets)
2. Change to a different phone: Be it an earlier iPhone, or an Android / Blackberry. 
(Requires 2-year activation contract. $$$ in AT&amp;T pockets)
3. Change carriers. (Requires contract cancellation fee, plus two year agreement with another carrier and possibly a new phone if not unlocked. $$$ in AT&amp;T pockets)

Seems this is a very profitable issue to have.

**EDIT3** So I went to an AT&amp;T store and an Apple store. Returned my iPhone and got the new *inhale* Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket *exhale* I pull up some apps in my building and around town where my 4S was dead and IT WORKS!!  AT&amp;T and/or Apple need to make their customers aware of the issue with the phone downtown.

What's something you want to see a nonprofit org tackle in Chicago?,"Hey fellow Chicagoans,


I'm taking a non-profit management class and one of our first assignments that will be ongoing is to choose a type of nonprofit I'd like to found in Chicago. I figured crowd sourcing is a good place to start and am hoping I get at least a few ideas. This is for academic purposes only for now, but who knows - it could become a real thing.


**What kind of services would you like to see in your neighborhood or city provided by a nonprofit?**


Here are some topics I'm interested in:

* Think tanks

* Social inequality and stratification

* Minimum wage, wealth and income gaps, the shrinking middle class

* Mitigation of poverty

* Community development

* Youth mentoring/development

* Education (primary, secondary and higher ed) (I've actually thought of seeing if there could be some kind of CPS-nonprofit partnership in creating a boarding school for at-risk youth in need of a stable and supportive living environment, but I think that may be a bit too complicated for this project)

* Animal welfare

* LGBT rights

* Job training programs

* After school learning programs

I want to avoid anything art and museum related because it seems half of my class has that background and I rather not compete or blend in with them seeing that my program is in public administration and their programs are in their respective fields. I'm also not that into green technology, healthcare or transportation, but maybe you can change my mind. My undergrad degree is in sociology and criminology, if that helps. 


I'm definitely open to other areas of interest. Any and all ideas are appreciated!

Storing a classic car in Chicago/surrounding areas?,"Found out about a week ago that I will be moving to Chicago in a few months for a new position in the company. Very excited! My dilemma right now is that I own a Classic Mini Cooper that has been a bit of a side project. With the new position, it would be best to live in the city and as I've begun to look at real estate, most condo's only come with one space (if at all). Therefore, unless I can find a garage for rent or a storage unit for a reasonable price, I will likely have to sell the little guy - something I would like to avoid if possible.

Any suggestions on where I could store the car? If I can find a space in the suburbs in the neighborhood of $100/mo I might be able to swing it. It doesn't take up much space!

Chicago's...Finest...in Inaction?,"I moved to Chicago almost a year ago and just had my first interaction with the police force and 911 in the city. Needless to say I'm going to figure out what I need to do to avoid both at all costs even if I need them. This is a long one but I need to get it off my chest.

*TLDR: Shady Ruff Ryders dudes have been making noise all week early in AM. Finally get enough of  description I call cops and get one of the dead to rights. The cop shows up, the dude runs a red in front of the cop in a panic (?) and then the cop seems to have his own freak out and just drives away leaving the dude to continue to sit outside my place and blast music and get drunk.*

First off, the last few nights my area has dealt with really loud packs of 5-8 bikers on Harley's with the super loud radios. They will do circles around the block at a leisurely pace blasting their radios while they ""discreetly"" look into the windows of parked cars. They'll also just sit at the line revving their engines and cranking their music for 5-10 minutes while they talk and wait for some other guys to join them again, including this guy driving a Navigator who is part of their group and follows them around blasting music. 

So what's this got to do with 911/the police? After 4 nights in a row now I finally had enough and seen enough of the bikes that I could describer them so I called the non emergency. I let them know I had some descriptions and I could still hear the bikes loud n clear in the area and that I observed that some were either drunk because of how erratic they were riding (blowing reds and stop signs) or possibly looking for targets to rob as they were clearly canvassing the area and looking hard into parked cars they'd go by and most likely using the noise to mask the glass breaking. 

I hung up and maybe 30 seconds later the guy in the Navigator pulls up across the street from my place, parks his car about 6-8 feet off the curb in the street, and proceeds to just crank his music. To be honest it wasn't that bad, sounded lie a lot of really uptempo crazy Arabic stuff. But it's 3:45 so I called back and this time they escalated me to 911. I tell them everything again including how I believe this person in particular is drunk because he's blocking half the street, his music is loud and he's being an overall d-bag like drunks are great at. 

So 2 minutes turns to five turns to ten turns to almost fifteen minutes that Im waiting for the cops to show up and nothing. He hasn't moved at all but he's occasionally turned up his music loud enough at times that I can hear it in my bathroom with the windows and doors closed even 12 stories up. 
 Finally almost 15 minutes in the cop shows up. Im watching him roll up slowly next to the navigator and then just put it in park where he sits for about a minuet and a half while this guy still cranks his music. 

Finally he notices the cop and the music comes down a lot but doesn't turn off and another minute goes by where Im guessing the cop is talking to him and then all of a sudden the dude in the Navigator just drives away...through a red light right in front of the cop. I know the cop is surprised by this because his car suddenly shifts into drive and starts to follow but then stops at the red light to look both ways while meanwhile, the other guy has fully cranked his music again to the point I can hear it louder and clearer than ever almost two blocks away where he's just stopped his car again in the middle of the street, stereo cranked, engine running looking like he's waiting for the cop to catch up.

The cop gets the green finally (and there was no one on the street anyways) and gets about mid way through the intersection...before he stops completely, makes a hard right and just drives off down the street and away. The dude in the Navigator then just cranks his stereo even LOUDER and drives off. I went down to the ground floor to see this for myself thinking there had to be some trap the cop was going to get him with...but no. The dude drove by me again while I was standing outside, music blasting and sipping off a bottle he had between his legs and then parked his car back in the same spot 8 feet off the curb and he's been sitting there since untouched. 

So basically yea...I just learned my lesson to not waste my time with 911 or the police here. Thanks Chicago!

Seeking advice on neighborhoods to consider,"I've been going through the wiki, tons of great info there.  Would like to hear some opinions given the info below.

- Public transport options to downtown
- A place to park a car.  I definitely want to be in a neighborhood where I can walk, bike, or use public transport to get most everywhere I need to go, but I would like to keep a car around for visiting family and friends out of state.
- Preferably a neighborhood of people primarily in their 30's or older, but not totally family oriented.  Would like to avoid college or 20-something neighborhoods.
- Prefer a neighborhood with at least a little ethnic diversity, not too sterile and white-washed.
- Decent options of bars/restaurants/live music within walking or biking distance.  I prefer dive bars to yuppie bars.

Advice on where to stay for North Coast Music Fest visit?,"Hello, /r/Chicago!

My partner and I will be visiting your beautiful city during Labor Day weekend for the North Coast Music Festival at Union Park. We've both been to Chicago before, but it's been several years for both of us, so our memories are hazy.

I'd like to ask what your recommendations are for lodging (neighborhoods and such), with the few considerations below. Airbnb has been our go-to, but we're open to standard hotels.

We'll be driving from another city in the Midwest, so parking is needed, but we'd be happy leaving our car alone for the weekend if public transportation is decent near our accommodations.

We've never been to North Coast before, and honestly, this will be the biggest music festival I've ever attended, so we have no sense of how large the crowds will be or how busy public transpo will become. If there are affordable parking garages near Union Park, we're happy to drive over and walk several blocks to avoid congestion.

Any advice is appreciated, especially if you have experience with the many festivals that seem to happen in Chicago throughout the year!

Obviously something within reach of Wabash either by train,bus, car: My schedule is flexible so I can avoid morning traffic by coming into at any time. The company owns the building so we have valet parking(paid by company..might not be an everyday thing though). I prefer non-car travel.

So how about the south south side( =a gentrifying area)? Crime ridden areas.....I'm kinda torn. I've had relatives barely survive drive by shootings in Chi-town but....but my pay is limited( I could spare $500-900 a month).

Any cheap Ethnic enclaves that could score me some good deals on rent?

Planning Exploratory Visit,"My wife and I visited last February for a weekend and we loved the city, now of course we are considering moving there if things work out job wise.  

In the next few weeks we want to visit for 3-4 days and really try to scope out the neighborhoods, as opposed to hitting up the more touristy areas. Basically we want to see the city and what the day-to-day pace is like. We plan to ride the L during rush hour to get an idea of how long it takes to get places and what the crowds are like, scope out area grocery stores, parks, etc. All things that would be good to know for moving to a neighborhood.

At the moment we are looking at areas where we could score a 1B for under $1300, cheaper the better of course. We would consider studio if it was a good size, but we have two cats so a tiny studio won't work for us. 

On our last visit and likely for this one as well we are staying in Wicker Park, which for better or worse seems to be the hipster capital of the city. We want to explorer Wicker Park/Logan Square and the sounding areas. While a bit hipstery we like it as a good starting point for living in Chicago, not super expensive, close to lots of food and drink, on the Blue Line, etc.  

It looks like the farther west you go from Wicker/Logan Square the seedier the area gets, is there any specific cutoff where we should not consider areas past X street? Any tips for areas within those neighborhoods that are good/bad?

Rogers Park and Edgewater seem promising from what I've read here, but we didn't get that far north on our last visit. Any recommended starting places for exploring up that way?

I've also heard Oak Park is nice, how does that compare to the Logan Square / Wicker Park area? Is it more suburb like or still pretty urban? 


Lastly are there any areas we should avoid all together as two out of town people wandering through neighborhoods? Obviously we shouldn't Stroll through Austin in the middle of the night, but are there any specific areas that we are better off keeping away from?

Ahhh Chicago...Man shot on Estes Ave at 8am this morning. Gunman took his own young daughter to the hit and used her to hide his identity as he fled.,"Don't really expect to hear gunshots so early in the morning but at 8am this morning a man in Rogers Park was shot twice. The assailant walked up behind the man with his young daughter in tow, shot the other man, then picked up his daughter and used her positioning to hide his face from onlookers as he fled south through the alleyway. 

This man is clearly a danger to this neighborhood....that much we can say from his actions. But more importantly, he is an absolute danger to his child. Any man who takes his own child to go shoot/kill another human being is clearly unstable in his ways of thinking. I never thought I would hear of such a thing but it has happened.

•Oct 13, 2009: Conviction, Felon in Posession of a Firearm while on Parole, 2 years

•August 5, 2010: Conviction, Armed Habitual Criminal, 6 years

•July 9, 2016: Arrest, Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon, released after a few hours.

• **Edit: he was on parole for his Aug 2010 firearm crime when he allegedly  committed this quadruple murder.**


The person charged with murdering 2 year old Levontay White was previously arrested for armed robbery and several firearms charges as well.

We are in our 30s, no children, small dog. We will be renting to start, and I'd like our budget to top out at $2,500/month, anything lower being ideal, but there's wiggle room for the right situation. We would like a 2BR/2BA, but a 1BR/1BA is fine if the location is top notch.

We would like to be in a neighborhood that anybody would be comfortable walking around in at night. We are *not at all* interested in being surrounded by a party crowd, and having a quiet place to come home to where we can relax and have peace is *by far* our highest priority. Coming in close behind is easy access to public transport, easy access to a good (safe) park to walk the dog, and easy access to a grocery store.

On the plus side but not top priorities are a vibrant food scene, an area with some choices to grab a well made drink or good beer (but nothing crazy), and if there's an area where we could rent that ticks these boxes and also has a private yard for the pup, I'm all ears.

Are any parts of them dangerous (like how far is too far west? too far north?)  General tips on the area?

"Considering a move to Chicago, seeking your thoughts.","The boyfriend (30) and I (22) are considering making the move from Portland to Chicago sometime in the next year. We've really only started talking about it, and before we make any concrete decisions, I wanted some honest thoughts from Chicago locals. 

Basically, we're tired of living in a town that has a 12% unemployment rate all the time, that we've lived in for years without really moving forward. We love Portland but we're hoping for a bigger-city experience with more culture, a wide variation of foods to enjoy, a killer music scene, and cool shit to do at low cost. A good friend of ours is making the move in the next year, and based on what we've heard about Chicago it seems like the place for us. Admittedly, we've never visited, but before you say we ought to, part of the adventure is moving to a brand new place we've never been and starting from scratch. With resources like the internet and this community I think it's possible to keep the spirit of adventure alive, but be smart about the move. 

He's studying film, hoping to pursue a career as a screenwriter, and has extensive (10ish years) experience in food service and bartending, from yuppie-holes to fancier establishments and divey bars. I'm a certified Nurses Assistant hoping to start nursing school soon, but still working on my pre-reqs. I've also worked as a stripper for two years full-time and still do that on the side for extra cash/exercise/fun. We love art, museums, beer, live theatre, eating new things, music (I'm fond of a local band of yours called Otis,) and though we'll have a car to make the move, prefer the public transportation option when we can. I think between the three of us, we'd be able to pay up to $1,500/mo for rent+utilities. 

My questions for you are: what's the job market like? What are the schools like, particularly nursing programs? Are the things we hope to find in as much abundance as we're told? What are the downsides to living in Chicago? The upsides? What's the public transportation like? Portland has a great reputation for their PT system, but it's actually been in steady decline the last two years due to bureaucratic corruption- is Chicago the same? Can someone give me a brief overview of the neighborhoods? Which ones are skeezier, gentrified, melting pots, and to be avoided? Is there anything I've missed that I should consider?

Any advice from locals would be appreciated. As I said, we haven't made a firm decision about moving yet, but are definitely leaning towards it. I've already made it clear that I want to move. So fire away, and thanks in advance!",chicago,0,1392072605.0,3,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1xk5ex/considering_a_move_to_chicago_seeking_your/

These are all the times Gregory Bovino tweeted at me,"I’m Gregory Royal Pratt, Chicago Tribune journalist and Lori Lightfoot book author. I was on the team covering Midway Blitz. During the operation, I was often harassed online. I was also doxxed after Tricia McLaughlin suggested I was breaking the law by reporting on the immigration raids. I’ve been here before to share stories and make comments.

Anyway, with the Atlantic reporting that Gregory Bovino was demoted and on the verge of retiring, I’ve been reflecting on the past few months. I’ve been collecting Bovino’s tweets at me, partly for historical reasons, partly because they usually were followed by bot accounts threatening me and making nasty comments. They’re a little time capsule of the Trump administration’s first year and activities in Chicago so I thought I’d share them somewhere. I’ve got friends who will sometimes text “Now now” at me because of these. They are a real window into how the administration has communicated with the public. It was crazy though: He stepped up his tweets at me after leaving the city but kept ignoring my interview requests.",chicago,1451,1769478770.0,124,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1qo0a2w/these_are_all_the_times_gregory_bovino_tweeted_at/
Your Specific Rights When You See ICE,"I've personally been wanting the specifics of what my rights are for the next time I see ICE, so I can be clear on what my rights are instead of telling them just to gtfo. 

Here's what I got in case helpful to anyone.

Edits: Appreciate all the discussion! Making updates here to clarify:

1. There are rights you SHOULD expect in any ICE encounter and then the unpredictable reality of crossing paths with agents
2. There is risk in doing anything other than walking in the other direction when you see ICE and those risks sadly are much greater for  non-citizens
3. Like others have noted, GREAT resources from ICIRR (https://www.icirr.org/fsn)

Right to Record: Your First Amendment right to audio/video record police in public is protected by the Illinois Supreme Court in People v. Clark (2014 IL 115776). 

*And of course protected by the 1st amendment to the constitution, BUT we know that  DHS officially views recording as a form of harassment and intimidation, which they believe falls under existing laws against impeding officers (possibly citing 18 U.S. Code § 111 - Assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers or employees). So, again there's a divide in understanding of the law here and risk because of it. 

Observe, Don't Obstruct: You cannot be arrested for merely observing. ""Obstructing"" under 720 ILCS 5/31-1 &amp; 5/31-4 requires physical interference or providing false information, not just following or filming.

*See above. This is what Illinois states on the matter, while DHS states the polar opposite. 

ID Required &amp; No Riot Munitions: Per a TRO from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis (Oct. 10, 2025), federal agents in Chicago (who are not undercover) must wear visible ID and are banned from using tear gas or pepper spray on peaceful persons.

*TRO only requires agents to have some form of identification (badge number, agency). No comment on their wearing masks. Also, ICE has and will continue to take a very liberal interpretation of  what constitutes a ""peaceful person"", so your recording while retreating may still get you sprayed, gassed, etc. 

No Warrantless ICE Arrests: The Castañon Nava consent decree, extended by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings until Feb. 2, 2026, requires ICE to have probable cause or a warrant for arrests in the Chicago area, limiting unlawful detainment.

*The nuance here is ""probable cause"".  DHS's position here is Probable Cause exists when the facts and circumstances within an officer's knowledge would lead a reasonable person to believe that an individual is a non-citizen, so while there is supposed to be judicial oversight (consent decree noted), the number of ongoing arrests that are warrantless is not letting up and non-citizens disappeared before a court can weigh.

What to do when you are being harassed and followed on the street by a homeless person?,"I'm from NYC, and for whatever reason, I've never had to deal with this before. My experience so far is that homeless/beggars are more aggressive in Chicago than in NYC. I've only lived here for a month and I've already had a few experiences with hostile people on the streets.

Last night, a man in tattered clothes on a bike was following me down Halsted in Lakeview, harassing me for not responding. Eventually, I starting trying to reason with him because he was growing increasingly confrontational, and I was afraid that he would attack or rob me if I didn't acknowledge him. He told me in the south side I would've been shot dead in the street for ignoring someone.
 
I almost called 911 as he was following me, but I didn't feel safe doing that either because he was so in my personal space that I didn't have time to privately call, and I thought it could trigger him. I actually was able to reason with him. For the future though, what is a good tactic for dealing with aggressive homeless people on the streets?

I think I mostly hang out in relatively safe areas, and I'm also not exactly small/frail so I didn't think this would be an issue moving here. If he had a weapon on him (and I never did find that out) I have trouble imagining what I would've been able to do if he was completely unreasonable.

ridiculous drivers,"Obviously all people in cities are bound to drive a bit more freeform than in the suburbs, but how do people deal with the absolutely ridiculous way people drive in this city? People blatantly blow red lights down western, cheat 4-way stops, use turn lanes to jump traffic, it's absolutely insane. My main problem beyond possible damage to my car is the safety of bikers and pedestrians, like seriously there's no reason to drive 60 down a 30. I'm basically the only person driving late at night who doesn't blow reds lol. The worst part is these people never EVER get pulled over by the police. I had a man cut his car in front of mine on Halsted and once I honked he followed an harassed me all in view of a cop. I'm tired of people being able to drive in a way that endangers people's safety, all while cops bomb people with tickets for non-violent non-moving offenses.

Want to say thank you to a stranger from Chicago redline,"Thanks folks for so much kindness. I didn’t have my notification on and didn’t realize so many people read this. I hope that stranger read it too. Chicagoans are the best!

——————

3 years ago, I had this encounter with a stranger who stood up for me on Chicago redline when I was sexually harassed. I want to say thank you to him.

I'm Asian. I was at my early 20s and came to this country for grad school. That day I was on redline by myself, and a guy who looked like he was talking to himself came to sit next to me. I didn't care that much at first, but he started to put his shoulder right next to mine even when there were plenty of empty seats available next to him. I stood up and went for those seats, and he laughed and came after me again and touched my neck, saying things like ""it's ok to touch a white guy. I want to touch you and eat you"".

I basically panicked and froze for a few seconds because that was the first time I was sexually harassed in United States. I imagine I would've fought back if I was in Asia, but as a foreigner and a student I was just built to be scared of this giant who seemed like he got a gun looking thing in his bag. I forgot to run away or call for help.

And there was this person, far away from us but stood up for me. He said out loud that she obviously doesn't want to talk to you stop harassing her. The giant white guy next to me started to use swear words against him with anger. A lot of swear words. He also said ""America is the best you all go to h*ll"".

Till this day I still regret that I wasn't brave enough to go over there and say thank you to him. Once I got the chance I left the car immediately and felt like I couldn't breathe, but soon I realized I might never have the chance to say l'm grateful to that stranger. People would say that lots of kind ones would've done the same thing, but that day he was the only one who actually did it, and it means so much to me. He was part of the reason why I'm still here and haven't lost my faith in this country, in social construct, or in humanity. I have been trying to get stronger both psychologically and physically, got my dream job after graduation, and helped someone when they needed it, just like how this stranger helped me.

So if you're reading, I want to say for everything thank you, and please keep being kind as you inspired so many. ",chicago,289,1727143097.0,12,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1fo1jm6/want_to_say_thank_you_to_a_stranger_from_chicago/

Apology to a woman on the red line today,"Hey r/Chicago! Using a throwaway to avoid identification, but I just wanted to try to get a message out to someone (not sure if this is against any rules, mods feel free to do your thing!). This evening I was waiting on the Roosevelt red line platform with a woman who was subject to intense harassment and racism (this is an understatement) from another individual.

I won't go into too many details, but if you are that person, or if you know that person, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for not trying to intervene. I froze up in the moment and was too scared to do anything, but I wish I had at least said something to you to try to help you out of an abusive situation. I can't go back in time, or control other people's actions, but I wanted you to know that I'm thinking of you and that I'm really sorry that happened today. Times are really tough for everyone, and there's absolutely no excuse for the kind of behavior you were subjected to today.

This experience motivated me to donate to Asian Americans Advancing Justice Chicago, and I encourage others to consider doing the same or help similar causes in the season of giving.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I am well aware that I did not take the best course of action. I felt that I could not do anything without risking my own safety, but thanks to u/breadhead9 I now have some tools in case I'm ever in a similar situation moving forward. Thank you so much for sharing that resource!

&amp;#x200B;

SECOND EDIT: This got a lot more attention than I expected, for better or worse. This was my first post on here, and I've realized that I'm a lurker for a reason. My intention was that the woman involved may be a Redditor and might read this, for whatever that would be worth (admittedly, it probably wouldn't mean much but maybe something). I appreciate all of your comments and critiques, though it definitely hurts to hear names thrown around. I don't believe that my apology was ""bullshit"" as some have claimed, but I don't get to define whether or not an apology is acceptable. 

To the people criticizing my donation, I considered omitting that portion of my message to begin with because I realized there would likely be some critique of that. However, my thought was that it might be valuable to get the organization's name out there. Paying money can't solve every problem, but it was something tangible I could do to acknowledge that injustice exists in our community. This is not about my feelings or validation, and even if it were, I certainly don't feel ""better"" since writing this post and donation. I do feel better educated, thanks to all of your comments.

How short is the road to racism?,"I live in Uptown. I as a white(ish) thirty-something male experience discomfort and some amount of fear around black people in certain specific contexts these days, because I have observed that they will target white people with certain types of harassment, depending on what the situation is. It is not uncommon for a black man, woman or child(!) to spit (on the ground as a sign of disrespect) as they pass me or my wife while walking down the sidewalk, for example. [There are the packs of black youths who have been mob-robbing white people on the street.](http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/06/chicagos_violent_flash_mobs.html) I've been targeted by kids gleefully throwing stuff at me while their older siblings look on with approval while I'm just trying to listen to my music on the train. I have also been attacked by a group of teenaged blacks who hit me over the head with bricks, etc, had me on the ground until the police showed up, just because I happened to walk by them in an area with not a lot of people around. I've always seen this as basically a way to reinforce a group unity via us vs. them, we are at war, our lives are rough because of white people, and more generally as a result of the segregation in this city, but the open hostility and animosity coming from that culture really starts to wear on your liberal sensibilities. I recently took a trip to St. Louis, where I didn't get that sense at all from the black people I encountered. But in Chicago there is just so much tension. Obviously the great majority of black people are decent, and there are plenty of white people who are indecent here. The point is the indecency in this case is racially directed from black to white. I just feel like, in this day and age, most people I know feel thusly: We are perfectly willing to accept any person of any race into our hearts, lives and communities. As such, it seems like the onus may be on black folks to ease racial tensions between whites and blacks, because it is the bad elements in their culture that continue to fan the flames.

EDIT: Dialogue_Dub has posted something I think everyone should read following this. She points out the basic flaw in my post, which is that I am approaching this from my paradigm. While I believe most people are willing to treat black people with respectful color blindness because that's how my base behaves, that is likely not to be the norm, unfortunately.

EDIT: It's really surprising to me that people keep suggesting that there must be something about me that is inviting violence. Let me tell you, there isn't. As I have revealed, I am over thirty years old. The things I've described have happened over the course of time, and to other people close to me as well. It isn't as though I'm afraid to walk out of the house for fear of being attacked or cower and skitter in tense situations, nor do I feel as described above whenever I see a black person of any kind. It's usually pretty easy to tell who has a chip on their shoulder or who is out to mess with you. In addition to fairly regular passively or mildly aggressive behavior (like the spitting) I perceive, the attacks are things that have happened to me and people I know over the years, information I have first hand to illustrate my point that it's sometimes difficult to keep economic and other historic impetus for racism in mind when dealing with bad attitudes directed by blacks at whites.",chicago,66,1315328965.0,212,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/k6kte/how_short_is_the_road_to_racism/

Warning! Do NOT use Apartment Locators/Chicago Apartment Exchange (Chicago),"DO NOT USE APARTMENT LOCATORS/CHICAGO APARTMENT EXCHANGE

My roommate and I have been searching for an apartment the weekend of Oct 30-Nov 3rd with stated intentions to sign and move-in this weekend. An ""Agent"", by the name of Lara, was sent to meet with us at several locations. While she boasted about loving her job and working on her own hours, she clearly does not understand that that does not mean her clients work on her hours. Lara consistently arrived late, without keys, changed the price (Ex. no deposit, but a 1st and last month rent AND a move-in fee? Or showing places above our monthly limit and insisting we would not find anything within our range [glad we never disclosed our full range]), had a misguided sense of what ""big"" rooms are, and did not know what utilities were included. She even had us travel to a location that she failed to show up at.

A call to her ""Manager"" about her lack of professionalism was shared with Lara and her colleagues and followed up with nasty texts to my roommate stating ""nice try"" and that her colleagues and manager were ""aware of us"" and would not be assisting us either. A final threat that they would be putting up a review on us (where is unknown) and how ""entertaining"" we had been by expecting professionalism was concluded by a second voicemail stating further contact would be considered harassment.

We are two ladies, who chose not to disclose we had 2K on hand so as to complete an application and obtain keys within a day. (Why our financial position did not dawn on her given that we had stated we wanted to find a place and move in immediately baffles me.) Clearly not letting Lara know this information was advantageous to us.

If you are looking for an apartment DO NOT USE APARTMENT LOCATORS/CHICAGO APARTMENT EXCHANGE. They are apartment pimps attempting to con people into over-priced, insufficient spaces.

The positive side for other apartment hunters is that there are a lot of lovely units available for decent prices. Just give yourself enough time and be persistent! We found a 3 bedroom duplex for $875! 

To the hero that helped me out this morning (belmont stop),"This morning I was on my way to a meeting downtown in Chicago and I was walking to the subway. On my way a man started following me. I could hear him saying some nasty things behind so I started walking a little faster. Keep in mind I am about 5'2"" 110lbs. He kept talking and as he did I was able to make out that he was saying those nasty things about me. I quickly pulled to the side and tried to let him pass but he stopped and started harassing me. I started walking again and he sped up so I did as well.

 I was about a block and a half from the belmont stop when a man realized what was happening and started walking with me trying to stay between the belligerent guy and myself. The first guy quickly became agitated and started yelling things and so I ran off toward the subway entrance hoping to get away from him. As I did the good guy called for security to come help as I got away into the train station. I was very upset and wasn't able to thank you. I don't have many friends here in the city so I often travel on my own. It's good to know that people can be nice and will help you out of a dangerous situation.

Thank you so much for intervening this morning. That man made me extremely uncomfortable, as I am sure you know based on the things he was saying!

Uptown: violent harasser at Lawrence and Broadway,"[edit: I have been asked to remove a picture of a violent person because it is ""unofficial."" You should be on the lookout for a red-faced leprechaun who will harass you and try to beat you. I'm so glad no one can see his face to call him out about it though.]


On Sunday at about 3:30pm, my partner and I were coming back from the Red Line when we were first harassed, then assaulted by this guy. We were waiting at the light for it to change when this man kept trying to get my attention. After several times, he started yelling homophobic things at us and as the light changed, started to follow us across the street (when this picture was taken). At that point, I told him to go away a few times. After turning around, he picked up a 2x4 from the gutter and came after us. My partner called 911 and was on the phone with the dispatcher. We attempted to duck into the restaurant on the corner, but it was closed. Feeling stuck, I turned around and started yelling at him to get the attention of people around us. He threw the 2x4 at me and scraped my wrist and ran after I continued to yell that he had assaulted me. He ran south to Wilson via the alley.  

An older man flagged down a cop car that happened to pass. They were able to take my statement and file a report, but I predictably haven't heard that he's been arrested. The guy seems like he's a local, if not a corner regular. He's easily prone to violence and seems to really like harassing women.

Aggressive homeless people on State St.,"Was taking a walk today as I needed to get things done and noticed that the homeless people out and around that area have become very aggressive. I understand that circumstances have been very difficult for everyone, particularly the homeless over this past year, but what I saw was concerning.

This homeless man came up to people on the sidewalk and started telling them that they are awful and should die for not giving him money, as well as following us while screaming at us as we walked down the street. I understand that these things sometimes happen in any major city, but I saw many people who were visibly concerned as a result of it. This has been going on for weeks now. I’ve personally been followed down the street by homeless people, as well as threatened or harassed.

The Shining at the Music Box theater Friday night,"The cinema experience will always trump the home theater. That said, there was an interesting screening at the Music Box theater in Chicago last Friday night. 

It was sold out and they started late to let the latecomers and concession line-goers back to their seats. The projectionist drew the curtain up late , which caused the first few seconds of the flying  long shots onto the red curtain. Not a deal breaker. I've been to the Music box dozens of times before but not with a packed house since the pandemic. I was expecting the uncomfortable seats (I always choose aisle) and know the obstruction from tall patrons in front of you as well as the numerous restroom and concession goers. The worst part was there was a patron with a loud persistent cough 3 rows back in the center section.  About 100 minutes in, the patron seated in front of her berated her about her cough and how it was inconsiderate for the entire audience. They engaged in an argument for about a minute with other audience members telling them to shush. She actually left her seat to consult with management (she claimed it was due to a sensitive throat and the ruffage from popcorn- not illness). About 10 minutes later she returned to her seat and exchanged pleasantries with the complainer patron, at which point he retorted ""Did you just hit me?"" loudly. This was followed with more shushes and finally they resigned to watching the end of the film with occasional coughs sprinkled in. This is par for the course for cinema but the entire sold out theater experience was not pleasant after 2+ years of near empty cinemas and peaceful viewing from home.

That said, some hi-lites:

*  the soundtrack was intense and immersive. Some of the screeching notes during the climactic 3rd act were piercing to the point I had to cover my ears.

* The laughter for Jack's lines were more mutually shared and not awkward though a bit driven by meme culture audience reaction.  This was actually nice considering how awkward his behavior might be met by sensitive viewers in the post me-too era.

* The jump scare moments are much more impactful with a full theater sound system behind them.",chicago,31,1662250350.0,25,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/x58v0v/the_shining_at_the_music_box_theater_friday_night/
"How did you get your ""Chicago Education""?","What I mean is this- I moved here recently and have no sense of why things are the way they are here, as I'm from the east coast and no one ever discusses Chicago except when Abe Lincoln comes up or maybe mobs/prohibition.  Since I can't go back in time and relive my life here, I'd like to try to educate myself on your city now that I am a resident.  The following questions are rhetorical and are grossly general but point to stuff I'd like to read, watch, listen to and learn about (I'm not trying to start a discussion on these here, I want you to tell me how to find source information as I'm sure many topics share common history): How did corruption become normative here, why are the people so god damned friendly, the architecture and public spaces so beautiful, the races so segregated, the school system such a mess, the food so diverse and highly valued, the neighborhoods so insular, etc.  

In Baltimore, it took me a few years to begin to wrap my mind around how we got to today and where the city is headed and I needed to read and consume a lot of information to even come a little bit close to grasping how it all happened and continues to happen.  Baltimore is small, Chicago feels so much bigger and harder to crack.  How did you get your education on the cultures and history of this city?  Can you recommend books, movies, shows, podcasts, music, walking tours, whatever to me?  I went to the Chicago History Museum and it helped get a sense of how much Native Americans shaped the colonization here but between 1800 and now, there wasn't much to fill in the blanks except some valued topics such as ""Jazz!  Hot dogs!  Fires! Civil War!  Railroads!""

I want to have some sense of place in my new home without harassing people and sounding like the big tourist I currently am.  What should I be digesting and doing?  I have my library card and good walking shoes, I'm open.

IL Felony for Recording Cops VS Federal Healthcare Regulations,"Federal Healthcare Regulations supersede state law and establish that you have the right to communicate in any way you choose with your healthcare provider. By definition in the Final Rule and Omnibus Rule anyone that provides, bills, or pays for health care services is a health care provider.  This includes you.  

**Health services are defined in federal regulations as anything that supports the health of an individual.**

**The Chicago Stingray operation the other day?**  

That was a violation of federally protected Privacy Rights.  Those people were communicating with their health support team to coordinate a peaceful protest.  It does not matter that the protesters do not think of themselves as Healthcare Providers. 

**TLDR:** When you record an event involving state police, federal law may protect you for communicating with your health support team via recording (recording is the form of communication) to support the health of yourself and the people harassed by the cops.

Chicago is not what outsiders chalk it up to be.,"I’m almost embarrassed to shit out what I typed out, so I’ll save it. Is every major city a sack of shit?  What stories do you have that would make the worst parts of Chicago sound like Scottsdale, Arizona?

Edit: it seems like people are misreading my post. I’m not complaining about Chicago. I’ve never felt threatened from just walking around minding my business there and I even had a gun pulled on me, randomly, the first night after I moved there. I just came to Wichita and I’ve been harassed/threatened more than I ever was in Chicago. 

I was asking for stories of times people have been threatened with violence but the person didn’t follow up on it. I was definitely ham-bones last night.

[Announcement] Updates to /r/chicago policy and rules,"Hi everyone. What a long, strange trip it has been since the goofy blackout and then the sacking of all the mods, eh?

As 2015 comes to a close, I wanted to give an update on our goals and hopes for /r/chicago as well as make a bit of a clarifying note on our rules here.

**Goals:**

We want /r/chicago to be a more welcoming place than it is now.  That doesn't mean ""more tolerant of seeing the same post asking for advice on what places to visit"", but it does mean ""maybe people should read the entirety of a question before assuming the sidebar answers it"", for example...

We'd like to see more users browsing and upvoting content in /r/chicago/new, as long as it's relevant to /r/chicago and fits the rules of posting here.  The only way to improve the environment here is positive assistance from the community - no amount of moderators can do this by themselves.

**What is a moderator's role?**

I think it's important to point out the roles *and capabilities* that moderators actually have.

As owners of a subreddit, the ""role"" is really up to the mods. Some users prefer that moderators do nothing but delete spam. Others prefer that mods keep a subreddit on-topic. Still others prefer strict control of discourse for the benefit of the community (examples like AskScience, where only proper scientific responses are allowed).

To us, our role is to keep /r/chicago on-topic (Chicago related), as friendly as is reasonable (no personal attacks), and to also clean up spam, reposts etc when we can.  We want /r/chicago to be a place where people can hear the latest news about what's going on here, discuss local issues and share information about everything from entertainment to politics as long as it's Chicago relevant.

Note that our *capabilities* are not what everyone necessarily imagines. We cannot see who is downvoting posts, we cannot prove that multiple alt accounts are the same person (the reddit admins can), and we cannot stop someone from harassing you via PM or on other subreddits.  Our *only* capabilities are basically editing the sidebar, wiki and CSS here, and removing comments/posts or banning users. We don't have any special tools beyond that, which is something I think a lot of users don't realize.

Since we cannot identify / verify vote manipulation, you are better off reporting that to the reddit admins than reporting it to us. All we can do is report it to the reddit admins on your behalf.

We also can't be expected to read every single comment/post, and keep coming back to every post for new comments, so we rely on the community to help us by reporting things that break the rules. Please remember that the report button is for things that break the rules, not things you disagree with.

**Challenges:**

City subreddits are much harder to moderate than others, because the only thing we are (somewhat) guaranteed to have in common is geography.  In a gaming subreddit, everyone likes games and wants to talk about games.  In a hockey subreddit, everyone wants to talk about hockey.  What about in a city subreddit?  Some want to talk about the news/goings on - some want to vent/complain about things unique to their experience in the city - some want to share photos.  Deciding what constitutes appropriate content is difficult for both moderators and users.

**Changes:**

With the high profile news events that have highlighted racial tension in our city, we've experimented a bit with rules ranging from ""no racism"" to ""no discussing race at all in this particular thread"" with varying degrees of success / controversy / failure. The bottom line is that NOTHING we choose is going to make everyone happy. We do want people to be able to discuss race, as racial tension in this city is an issue and one that requires conversation. In order to try and foster that, we want to clarify the following:

- Conversation about race is certainly allowed, but requires discretion. We will have to judge based on context and history whether or not something is ""racist"", ""racist enough to justify a ban"", or just ""ignorant"". We may not get it right 100% of the time, but we will do our best to be fair as well as transparent.

- All users are expected to be respectful to other users at all times.

- Posts which are considered to be made solely to ""bait"" users will not be tolerated. If you don't know what this means, it probably doesn't affect you.

- Personal attacks/insults/demeaning statements about a specific user/group will be removed.

- Comments or posts deemed to be harmful, slanderous or demeaning (e.g. public shaming), etc. will be removed. 

The first offense will typically result in a temporary ban, with increased ban length or permanent ban for repeat offenses. Slurs are not tolerated in in r/Chicago. Period. The usage of slurs will result in a permanent ban. (It should go without saying, but if you're quoting someone else or otherwise not using the slur ""as a slur"", an exemption may be made)

---

Respectfully presented opinions (and facts) are welcome in to r/Chicago. We expect most users will use common sense to determine what goes too far, remember we're human on both sides of the screen. Blatant statements of bigotry, with no added context, will be removed.

Please be aware that this is a site on the internet that hosts anonymous users. Thick skin is required. That said, don't be abusive or harass other users. If it is deemed that your conduct is detrimental to the experience of other users, your posting privileges will be revoked. Comments and posts mentioning subreddits and websites deemed to be harmful, because of demeaning content, spam, etc. will be filtered. Unmarked NSFW links, unmarked spoilers, misleading links, spam, and the likes can be removed. Editing comments and posts to mislead and/or advertise will result in removal of the post/comment.

We do understand sometimes people get emotional and react to personal attacks when they'd be better off not doing so, and not everyone who gets into a personal attack is a horrible person.  Ultimately, we have to use our discretion and judgement on enforcing these rules, choosing when to ban and for how long, etc.  Chances are, if you have evidence of positive contribution to /r/chicago in your user history, you're more likely to get the benefit of the doubt.

We welcome your feedback and constructive criticism, and we will try as a team to stick to that. We are humans too, and that means we may miss a post or comment we should have removed, we may react more emotionally than we should, we may even remove something we shouldn't have.  We are committed, however, to having a dialog with you about that as long as it's approached respectfully.

We will be working on a new wiki page that outlines the rules and provides examples of what does / doesn't break those rules. However, everything is looked at on a case by case basis and there is no way to write rules that are black/white and can still be easily applied to all statements. At all times, we will be required to use discretion, context and user history to determine what to do with a given post/comment.

Police: Teenage girl 'sexually exploited' twice on NW Side since May,,chicago,51,1506778050.0,14,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/73evzh/police_teenage_girl_sexually_exploited_twice_on/
"Yesterday while walking home from work in the Loop I saw something pretty horrible. A man straight up punched his kid, and the cops did nothing.","So yesterday I left work a little early to take care of something at home. I always walk the few blocks when its decent out. Except this time I saw something pretty disgusting. About a block ahead of me was a family. Mom, dad, and their kid who looked to be about 7 or 8 years old. At first I saw the dad violently shake the kid by the arm. He could barely stand and keep his feet on the ground while the dad whipped him about. This sent all sorts of WTF signals off in my brain. I got smacked as a kid and generally think its not the worst thing in the world, but not great either. This was way, way beyond that. 

So I started following them. About two or three blocks later at Dearborn/Van Buren, the father actually punched him. I called 911 right away and described what was happening. They asked for a description of the dad and kid, where they were at, what direction they were heading, and my name. After giving them the info they said thanks and hung up. I wanted to make sure the cops found them so I continued following them about a block behind. 

After turning the corner and no cops in sight, I called 911 again to let them know where they were. Again the operator gave me the feeling that they really didn't give a shit, but at least this time the family entered a restaurant and would be staying put for the time being. Enough time for the cops to find them. This time, the 911 operator at least took my FULL name and my phone number so they could get ahold of me if need be (although I guess they have callerID so..). 

I waited awhile, probably about 20-30 minutes before a cop showed up. I flagged him down and told him what happened. He also looked like he didn't give a shit and didn't want to be there at all. The cop said he would go in and talk to them. Five minutes later he comes out and heads back to his car. I flag him down again, and again he looks annoyed like he is sick of me. I ask him what happens now and he says ""I talked to them, the kid says he's fine"". The officer got in his car and left.

I've never been more disappointed with society in the 5 or 6 years living in the city. A kid is very clearly abused and the cops do nothing. When you ask a kid who is being abused, of course he's going to say he's fine. He's probably scared shitless that if he says otherwise he'll get the crap beat out of him.

And its not like the kid was a mouthy brat either. He kept his head down and his mouth shut the whole time his dad was nearly beating the shit out of him. If his dad is willing to do that to him walking down the street surrounded by tons of people in rush hour, it just makes me wonder whats happening to him at home.

Thanks to the shitty Chicago police for their excellent services.

edit: No where did I call for them to arrest him out of nowhere. By ""they did nothing"" I mean they didn't even bother to write their contact information down for the report. I can't be certain, but I don't think a report was even written. When I talked to the officer afterward, he said nothing would be done purely because the kid said he ""was ok"".",chicago,13,1333636072.0,28,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/run3s/yesterday_while_walking_home_from_work_in_the/
"I'm sick of ""I'm visiting, what should I do?"" posts too - but I humbly ask that you please show respect for the safety of tourists...","I get it - I'm tired of the same posts too.  However, leading someone to potential bodily harm because they're ""ignorant"" is not funny and is certainly not the mark of a decent person.

If you don't like it, I think the best course of action is to downvote it and move on, or to comment that they should check the sidebar for such info.

More than once now, I've seen people ""jokingly"" (but without obvious indication that it's a joke) suggest tourists visit Englewood, etc...

Yes, it's *unlikely* someone will do this without googling a bit about Englewood and realizing they're being messed with... but if even one person (perhaps English isn't their first language, etc) ignorantly follows this advice and gets harassed or even hurt - that's a *bad thing*.

"Chicago, I need advice about terrible apartment complex","My little sister moved into her first apartment 1 month ago in Andersonville (corner of Summerdale and Damen). Found and paid for it all on her own. Unfortunately, when I helped her moved in I realized that the building was going to be problematic. 

1. The whole place smelled like cigarettes and cats (Neither are allowed)
2. The elevator was last inspected in 1994
3. One of the tenants informed us that there is a roach problem that the landlord refuses to take care of. 
4. None of the buzzers work on the front door, all tenants (40+ units) are unable to receive packages of any kind because of this

My little sister is so positive, she really tried to make the best of it all. Her air conditioners were broken upon moving in and he is being really stubborn about fixing them. We harassed him to take care of the roaches, finally he had somebody spray some raid in the unit. But it is obvious that the building is completely infested, a spray bottle wont do the trick.

I am not sure what to do next, I know that she can move but there are 40 other people in this building that live in awful conditions because of this asshole landlord. He is an old german guy who is super stubborn. I was thinking about setting up a meeting with the alderman. The roaches are really a health hazard and the out of date building inspections scare me. A lot of people who live in the building are immigrants who are afraid to stand up to the landlord. I am not afraid but I am not sure what to do next aside from having her move out. 

Reddit, I am ready to go into battle with this guy. Do you have any advice/help for me at all? 

TL;DR - Sister lives in a building with cockroaches, broken buzzers and sketchy elevators. Landlord refuses to fix. I want to solve this without having to move.

EDIT 1: She is going to set up a meeting with her alderman Patrick J O'Connor tomorrow. Hopefully he will help her out. If not it sounds like there are some great ideas mentioned here in the comments, legal routes etc. She can easily move, but there are 40 units- most of the people are immigrants who are afraid to speak up to this landlord. This has become more of a mission to us than anything!

CTA Sexual Harassment,"I am a 20-something woman, living on the North side of Chicago. I've been living here for about 4 years and take either the Brown line or the Red line every day.

In the morning, the trains get pretty crowded and being ass-to-ankles with a stranger isn't unusual, but a couple of times in the past couple of months I've been in a situation that has felt more than just uncomfortable. 

It's been just after the Fullerton stop and has happened definitely 2, maybe 3 times. It's hard to tell on a crowded train what's sexual harassment and what's just unavoidable invasion of personal space, but in this instance I guess it's a 'when you know, you know' situation.

I'm talking about a situation where a man is actively leaning against me in a way where I can feel his genitals -- 100% unwanted contact, and not just your average crowded train contact.

I've never gotten a really good look at the guy, but I have a feeling it's been the same guy on multiple occasions -- short, with a gray hoodie on.

I'm sure this has happened to other people. I'm wondering what you've done- I've just switched cars at the following stop and gone on with my day. Accusing someone of that kind of easily deniable and almost totally undetectable sexual harassment on a crowded train seems like it would be ineffective. 

Any advice? Solidarity? Does this sound familiar? Just trying to raise a little awareness. ",chicago,13,1383879795.0,16,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1q5fuz/cta_sexual_harassment/
PSA: Running red lights in the loop and sideswiping pedestrians is not acceptable.,"Here I am, walking across Michigan, I'm outside of the left turn lane with the crowd because everybody who crosses Michigan at randolph knows the signal phases, and everyone is waiting at the two edges of the left turn lane (from SB Michigan to EB Randolph) for the walk light to change, walk light changes, lady decides to floor it through the intersection anyways. She sideswiped me. So, I'm uninjured, but had I been a half a step forward, I'd be in a hospital bed. 

What really has me pissed off, is that situations like this are completely commonplace when I cross with signals. But I never have any problems or remotely close calls when I jaywalk (which I do a fair amount of). People in this city are so bad at following red light green light that it is in fact FAR safer for me to jaywalk than to cross with a pedestrian go signal. 

There's thousands of pedestrians in the loop every day, when you see them, and you see a red light, you STOP. You don't floor it. those 3 seconds are not worth maiming someone. (And probably my three seconds aren't worth my attempts to assert my right of way, but people have to learn to drive correctly somehow, scaring the shit out of them is the only thing I can think of since the police clearly aren't doing a good job).

Looking for a film title shot in Chicago with a scene of jumping from the Loop onto (possibly an open) car...,"Hi there, Chicago people!

I am looking for a film title, shot in Chicago for a very long time (over five years and longer).

- Basic genre of the film is action/crime. No comedy component at all.

- It was shot in color, in English.

- Most of the scenes are in Chicago.

- The main character chases the criminal or is chased by him on the Loop's railroad, jumping onto a (possibly open) car on the ground, which is driven by the criminal or another criminal (in the case he is chased by).

- I do not remember if the main character walks from a station along the railroad or he is at first on a train and then jumps onto the railroad while the train is running.

- The type of main character is Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis (these two are just an example), and such, who is action star and Caucasian. Perhaps he may be an Asian, like Jackie Chan. He is the chaser, not the one to be chased in general.

- The film was shot in late 80s and early 90s. Definitely before 2000. Perhaps shot in early 80s, but not before that.

- I watched this film on TV in late 90s, definitely before 2000.

- It could be not related to Chicago, in case it was shot in Seattle (monorail), Miami
or Canada (elevated railway).

- I watched this film on TV definitely before 2000.

- Being a fan, I have checked all Steven Seagal's films and none of them matches.

So far, I have checked the following films but none matches the one I am looking for.
Code of Silence (85), Red Heat (88), Rapid Fire (92), Running Scared (86), Assasins (95), Cobra (86), The Fugitive (93), Priamal Fear (96), Chain Reaction (96), Jackal (97), U.S. Marshals (98), Mercury Rising (98), The Negotiator (98), Bad Boys (95), Above the Law (88), Excessive Force (93), Risky Business (83), High Fidelity (00), About Last Night (86), Gladiator (92), Adventures in Babysitting (87), Planes, Trains, &amp; Automobiles (87), Flatliners (90), Medium Cool (69), Next of Kin (89)
(some of them found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Films_set_in_Chicago,_Illinois
http://www.chicago-l.org/multimedia/index.html )

Jackal as the whole tone most fits the one, but there is no such scene of jumping from the Loop.

Please help me identify the title. TIA

EDIT: The Hunter (80), Running Scared (86), The Package (89), Wanted (08), Judgment Night (93), Thief (81) are not the one. Thank you for your inputs.
All films with the first letter from A to Z listed at Wikipedia (link above mentioned) are not the one either.

EDIT 2: After reviewing all the Chicago films listed at Wikipedia, most of them fall out of the criteria either because they are too new or too old, or they are not crime film but are comedy. The rest does not fit the profile simply because there is no matching jump scene. At this point, I may have to conclude either a) the list is not complete, there is some not major films out there, and one of them is what I am looking for, b) my memory that the location is Chicago is wrong or in extreme case I was just dreaming. I really do not believe that is not the case though. If you have any information on this film, please leave your comment.

Random Act of Meanness in Chicago,"Today I was riding the train in Chicago, it was crowded so I stood near the door.  As the train emptied at the next stop I smushed myself to the side so others could get off. I'm very small, only 5' and petite so there was plenty of space to go around me.  I look to the left and there's this big guy about 6ft and fat, older in his 40s or 50s.  He was blocking the path for others to get out so he says 'go out'.  I stood there because I don't respond to orders from some random person.  He said it 2 more times and I responded by moving myself more to the side so he could go around me (plenty of space).  If he had said 'excuse me could you go step outside' i would have gladly moved outside, even though it wasn't necessary.  He could have moved any direction to go around me.  Then he clenched his fist and shook it and said 'dumb shit' and finally moved outside the train.  this guy is huge, probably 3 times my size.  I couldn't believe what I heard, what kind of person says that to a random person?

Chicago-specific advice needed: unpaid wages+evasive former employer.,"Hi, r/chicago. This is a throwaway account. I'm hoping for some Chicago-specific wisdom from more experienced heads than mine on how to solve a trivial, yet very annoying problem.

Back in November, I joined (as an independent contractor) a very small publishing rights company in Chicago. It is literally a one-person organization; the founder runs everything and the organization constitutes &lt;12 people, mostly fresh graduates of the University of Chicago (though the founder/CEO is not herself a graduate from there).

After I left in late November (the reasons are not relevant, but I will state that there was no animosity regarding either the work I *did* complete, nor the circumstances of my departure), I emailed asking politely for the founder/CEO to take care of my owed wages. Now begins the real drama.

* That week, my emails and phone calls (initially at discreet intervals, but increasingly insistent) were completely ignored. I have evidence that the founder/CEO actively avoided answering my call despite being in the office on at least one occasion.

* The following week comprised more evasion, until finally the founder/CEO answered my call and agreed to take care of the payment following my submission of invoice. I sent the invoice immediately following the call. 

* The founder/CEO responded, disputing the hours I had cited. Now, I will also disclose that I have minimal interest in making a fuss, so the hours I'd listed were the minimum that I considered reasonable. Nevertheless, I amended (under protest) the numbers somewhat, and supplied my W-9 along with this revised version. This was on Dec. 22.

* I received no further word from Dec. 23 through the end of 2011 despite several attempts at contact. Bear in mind that during a phone conversation on Dec. 22, the founder/CEO again promised ""immediate"" resolution and did not mention anything about holidays/vacations.

* The first week of January, on Wednesday, I contacted them again. The founder/CEO made a vague request for ""some more time"", claimed that the office had been closed the last week of 2011 (I allow this, despite my feeling that they should have mentioned this during the Dec. 22 conversation) and said that they would contact me on Thursday.

* I allowed the whole of Thursday to elapse and called them again near the end of business hours. This time, the founder/CEO starting yelling incoherently, claiming to be in ill-health, ranted about my documents (which, as I mentioned, had been in since Dec. 22), etc. and then hung up on me.

* After a curt email sent to the founder/CEO, I allowed the week of Jan. 9-13 to elapse. I received no contact during this time.

* Yesterday, I sent an email again reminding them of their obligation, waited through today (no contact), and am planning to call them tomorrow. In my email, I mentioned I would be showing up at their office on Friday if I received no word from them before then, and that I would contact them on Thursday by phone to allow them a chance to explain what in the deuce is going on.

So there's the situation. I should note that if anyone is wondering why I haven't shown up at the office before now, it is because the founder/CEO made a threat to ""have me removed"" (whatever that means). I will also state, very firmly, that I have not once harassed them on purpose. Whenever I have had to call repeatedly, the cause has inevitably been that this founder/CEO simply refuses to respond to initial polite/discreet inquiries.

They neither actually pay me, nor do they give me an expected date. They simply avoid all communications. So, r/chicago, what do I need to do to resolve this with minimal fuss? I have several big changes in my life coming up very soon, and I really need to extinguish this ridiculousness before then. The whole ""independent contractor"" clause leaves me with little by way of legal resources, and the $$ amount owed does not justify pursuing small claims court options.

Avondale/Logan Square - Stray/lost dog spotted,"Hi everyone - not sure if this is the correct way or place to do this, but the situation breaks my heart. Two nights ago my brother in law slammed on the breaks on Belmont and Drake to avoid hitting a stray/lost dog. We followed the dog for a couple blocks trying to get to it, offering it potato chips (it's all we had in the car), attempting to call it while not scaring him, but he/she was still very scared and very fast and got away. This morning a friend spotted the same dog near Belmont and Irene but also could not get to it in time. It was dark so the only description I really have is that it appeared to be a small/medium sized dog, dark wiry hair, long tail, shorter skinny legs, a little mangy. It looked to be a terrier or some kind perhaps. It didn't look to be hurt as it was running/walking just fine. I also couldn't tell if there was a collar or not.
I am just asking everyone to please keep an eye out for this dog, and any stray or lost animal really, and to please try to offer it help if you can. I realize that there are hundreds of lost/stray animals everywhere that also need help, but this one in particular just really got to me because we were so close to being able to help it and we couldn't.

Chicago Landlord/Tenant issues [x-posted from legaladvice] ,"[MORE INFO] I hope someone is still reading this. Landlord came back and asked that ""If you will pay me for 3 months or until I rent it out then we can break the lease."" Well, he rented it out a few days later so I thought, cool, can't do the whole I pay rent and the new tenant pays rent deal. He emailed back yesterday (9/8) accusing me that I broke everything and that I destroyed the apartment, causing him grief. Says he is going to sue me for 6 months of the remaining rent, court fees and bill me for damages if I don't give him three months. I think he is trying to scare me for money to pay for his shit...what does anyone think?


[UPDATE] Kind of. I found my apartment relisted, so at least he is trying to, in good faith, get the apartment rented out. He did, however, bully me saying I would have to pay for all the rent plus his legal fees because he assured me I wouldn't win a court battle. I talked with MTO who were confident in me and gave me sounded advice. I email him back a simple, ""What do you want"" and he hasn't responded. I might go to MTO to see if I have anything to counter sue, but I am still shaken up by all of it that I might just slink away from legal issues. Thank you all!

I live in Chicago, IL, my old zip used to be 60622. I had a bum landlord who wouldn't fix anything. I sent him a letter of termination stating all the violations he was in such as:

* Not providing with me a copy of a lease until July. He only furnished two pages because he didn't understand why I need the 7 pages of disclosure.
* He did not have the apartment cleaned as promised (in lease but I have no good copy of it so, blergh).
* My fridge was broken and I have a small child. He couldn't fix the fridge for a week, and it magically started to work. Then it broke a month later, and it took him another week to come out and replace it.
* He never fixed my washer and dryer after months of asking. It finally started to mold from all the water leaked.
* Took him a month to fix my toilet, as the handle was broken and I had to reach in to flush it. Also, he never gave me notice upon entranced or exit (48 hours) of my dwelling.
* The last straw was finding a 4 to 5 inch rusty hole in my daughter's room stuffed with steel wool.

These are most of the things, besides some feral cats and other tenant complaints. I haven't contacted him back because I don't want to say the wrong thing, and he sent me an emailing basically saying ""I can quote the law, but I don't follow it"" since this was the first time he has received written notice, but I have sent one before and one on my check line. I have found a few websites such as: City of Chicago Resident Landlord and Tenant Ordinance and have also contacted a lawyer. I have several people who have seen the condition of the house, and who would be witness for me.

I just want to know what other people think. Am I out of mind or could I be okay if we did go to court?

Anyone remember the name of a kind of cheesy history museum?,"When I was a kid, my elementary school from downstate took a field trip to Chicago. This would have been around 1988. One of our stops was a museum or something that had a bunch of displays of Chicago history. (It wasn't the [Chicago History Museum](http://www.chicagohs.org/). Much more small-scale.) The one indelible memory I had was a tour guide saying something about gangsters followed by a very loud machine gun sound. Then a curtain or a wall moved and there were some statues of gangsters with tommy guns. It scared the shit out of me.

Anyone remember a place like that or know what it was called?

The Most Telling Election #: Voter Turnout 2% Less Than When Rahm First Won,"[Source](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-mayoral-election-20150407-story.html#page=1): 

&gt;For an election that followed a weekend of religious holidays and fell during a week when most of the city’s schools are out on spring break, turnout approached 40 percent. That exceeded the near-record low of 34 percent in February’s first round. Four years ago, turnout was 42 percent for the open-seat contest after the retirement of former Mayor Richard M. Daley.

So, if the CTU and Left can't match the establishment candidate in money, how can they win if they can't get more people to the polls than when Rahm first won in a rout?! If I was Karen Lewis today, THIS is the number that would scare me.",chicago,0,1428528994.0,2,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/31x8r2/the_most_telling_election_voter_turnout_2_less/

The storeclerk didn't want to call us a cab, so we waited till the returning bus came and sprinted towards it.

iPhone Theft Redux,"I had recently posted a thread about my iPhone being stolen (see: http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/yh906/iphone_theft_ring/). A redditor had asked me to keep the thread alive.  Unfortunately, even though I managed to find cameras around the crime scene, that case appears to be a dead file.

However, last Thursday I was mugged again a block away from my apartment as I was returning home from work.  The mugger was caught, and is now being charged with a class 1 felony.  I wanted to share this story, and give a few tips on what you can do to help catch these thieves when you can't avoid them (I had everything put away in my purse and was simply walking home from work, so this was really just a case of wrong time, wrong place).

First off:  password protect the crap out of your iPhone or other smart phone device.  This isn't foolproof, but it's a good start.

Secondly:  Make sure your location settings are on and put them on lock down.  For iPhone users, make sure a passcode is in place and go from settings -&gt; general -&gt; restrictions -&gt; location.  Disallow changes.  This is very important!  You should be able to do this with other smart phones, so other smart phone users be sure to look this stuff up (and sorry I can't be of more help in that arena).

For the most part, you should be set.  If you really want to get ambitious you can jailbreak your phone and install a bunch of other fun apps that will disallow turning off your phone and even take pictures of your thief should your phone be stolen.  However, doing the above will take care of most problems you might have in locating your thief.

The final thing to remember is that if you get mugged, get the police there as fast as possible and get on your icloud right away.  This can be accessed from any computer with your apple ID at icloud.com regardless of whether or not you have the app on your phone.  As long as your location services are still on, and the phone is powered up, you can track them easily.  

In my particular scenario, I had an officer in my apartment (a neighbor was able to get me in as we live in a tight knit complex) and we were tracking his movements through icloud.  The officer was radioing another car to follow him for a while (the mugger had clearly taken off in a vehicle since he was moving so fast), and when we were pretty sure we had the right guy he was pulled over.  I was then asked to send a sound to my phone to confirm it was mine.  The next thing I know I'm being taken to a halfway point to ID the guy and spent the next few hours at the police station filing my report.  

I now have most of my important belongings back (he ditched my purse but kept the expensive stuff), and I have a court date with him this week.

One last thing I want to stress:  DO NOT FIGHT THESE GUYS!  I ran after my first attacker because there were enough people around to ID the guy and I was in a well lit area.  This last jerk jumped me from an alley while I was alone.  I gave up my purse right away, and it worked out for the better.  I am so grateful things didn't get any worse, and he just left me alone.

Well, that's it.  If anyone has any questions please feel free to ask, and stay safe out there, Chicago!

Sidenote-  Yes, I know it's ridiculous that I was mugged twice in two weeks.  I'm thinking about becoming the Chris Hansen of strong armed robberies; to catch a mugger.",chicago,19,1346781131.0,54,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/zcgr6/iphone_theft_redux/
How safe is it to walk around Lincoln Park in evening? (6-9 pm)?,"Despite my username I actually live in Chicago but I very recently moved there.  I like to walk most places if the route is physically possible and the weather right now doesn't bother me very much.  There's something I need to attend near Lincoln Park zoo tonight, and I'm coming from the Lincoln Park residential area (about a 25 min walk).  If I walked to and from the zoo (going to be there from like 6-9 pm) am I generally pretty safe, in terms of being violently attacked or mugged?  I chose this area specifically because it seems safe, but I've seen really mixed reviews online.  Would it be safer to take Uber or to walk?  I feel like statistically, a car crash would be more likely than a violent attack but perhaps I'm wrong?

Have you ever been mugged/robbed/jump in Chicagoland?,"I've been thinking about moving to Chicago for a while now, but the crime rate I constantly hear about has been the main thing that's deterred me. Moreover, two days ago, a friend of mine was robbed at gunpoint while jogging in Lincoln Park. A place most would consider one of the safest areas in the city. 

So just to get a broader idea to see if these instances are few and far between or if they are in fact just part of living in Chicago, I gotta ask:

How many of you have ever been robbed or attacked in Chicago? ",chicago,2,1414019090.0,30,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/2k1ij4/have_you_ever_been_muggedrobbedjump_in_chicagoland/

&gt; Jill and I are shocked by the senseless gun violence that has yet again brought grief to an American community on this Independence Day.  As always, we are grateful for the first responders and law enforcement on the scene. I have spoken to Governor Pritzker and Mayor Rotering, and have offered the full support of the Federal government to their communities. I also surged Federal law enforcement to assist in the urgent search for the shooter, who remains at large at this time.  Members of the community should follow guidance from leadership on the ground, and I will monitor closely as we learn more about those whose lives have been lost and pray for those who are in the hospital with grievous injuries.  
&gt; 
&gt; I recently signed the first major bipartisan gun reform legislation in almost thirty years into law, which includes actions that will save lives. But there is much more work to do, and I’m not going to give up fighting the epidemic of gun violence.

BREAKING: Jussie Smollett Found Guilty,"On [5 of 6 charges](https://news.wttw.com/2021/12/09/jussie-smollett-convicted-staging-attack-lying-police)

After a one-week trial it took the panel of six women and six men, only one of whom was Black, nine hours (over two days) to decide Smollett’s fate.

&gt;The first five counts related to Smollett’s conduct &amp; initial false report (to CPD officers) on the day of the ~~attack~~ hoax (Jan. 29, 2019), while the 6^(th) count related to his conversation (that he gave a false report two weeks later, on Feb. 14) with CPD detective(s).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Judge James Linn 'thanked the jury profusely' for their hard work and fair &amp; just verdict.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Judge James Linn set a post-trial hearing for Jan. 27, and said he would schedule Smollett’s sentencing at a later date. Disorderly conduct is a class 4 felony that carries a prison sentence of up to three years, but experts have said if convicted, **Smollett would likely be placed on probation** and ordered to perform community service.

EDIT: ^(\[ postmortem \])

&gt;“*I just hope that* \[Smollett and his attorneys\] *know that we went in there with an open mind*."" In the end, ""*we all thought we were doing Jussie a favor*,” said the juror, who asked not to be named.  
&gt;  
&gt;That \[6^(th)\] count charged the actor with lying to police during a second interview with detectives on Feb. 14 when he reported he was the victim of an aggravated battery. The other five counts of disorderly conduct Smollett was convicted of were for reporting a battery and for reporting a hate crime to other officers in the hours after the attack.  
&gt;  
&gt;Essentially, the jurors got hung up on the reasoning behind the last charge and why it was charged differently than the others.  
&gt;  
&gt;“*We were told it was an aggravated battery because he said they were wearing a mask*,” the juror said. But “*in all* \[of Smollett’s\] *accounts of what happened, he mentioned a mask*.”  
&gt;  
&gt;If prosecutors had charged all the battery counts the same, “*I think* ***we probably would have found him guilty”*** **on all six**, [she said](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/12/10/22828351/jussie-smollett-juror-interview-hate-crime-hoax).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Lengthy discussions to weigh the evidence and testimony during the trial accounted for how long the deliberations took, more than disagreement between jurors, she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The jury felt there were too many instances in the case that Smollett didn’t have credible answers for when he took the stand, the juror said.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, she said, the jurors weren’t presented with any witnesses that backed Smollett’s side.  
&gt;  
&gt;“*We all wanted to hear from Frank*,” the juror said, referring to Smollett’s friend/choreographer &amp; creative director, Frank Gatson  
&gt;  
&gt;Gatson, [who'd been visiting that night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sa8sLWL46I&amp;t=64s), is the person who initially called police — allegedly against Smollett’s wishes — and the juror said the group felt he would have been able to provide critical details that might have given Smollett’s testimony more weight.  
&gt;  
&gt;Gatson was included on the defense’s list of potential witnesses but was never called.

# Many legal experts agreed, in the absence of smoking-gun evidence, the trial came down to whose story was more believable, Smollett’s, or Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo’s?

&gt;Ultimately, though, the juror said, they found the testimonies of brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo more credible than Smollett — though she added neither brother was thought to have been completely forthcoming by the jury.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Their testimony**, however, **was backed up by police**, she noted. That was in contrast to Smollett’s defense, the juror said, which consisted mostly of “***character witnesses***” **who couldn’t testify to the facts of the case**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lead defense attorney Nenye Uche in particular said, she seemed to be **“*****just shooting from the hip*****.”**  
&gt;  
&gt;That the defense had **accused the brothers of seeking a $2 million payout** from the actor to change their story **didn’t sit well with the juror** when they presented no evidence or testimony to back up the demand; characterized as, '*something like blackmail*.'  
&gt;  
&gt;Following the verdict, [Uche criticized](https://twitter.com/jmetr22b/status/1469167965660753923) the jury’s split decision, saying, “*The verdict is inconsistent. You cannot say Jussie is not lying for the same exact incident*.”  
&gt;  
&gt;But Richard Kling, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law who followed the trial, praised the jury for its careful consideration of each of the counts.

# “I think that’s a wonderful reflection on the jury,” he said.

&gt;He disagreed with Uche’s assessment.  
&gt;  
&gt;“*Juries are* \[at times\] *inconsistent*,” [Kling added](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/12/10/22828351/jussie-smollett-juror-interview-hate-crime-hoax). “*This was not inconsistent. On five counts they found he was responsible, and the other one they were unsure*” so they declined to convict.

**tl;dr**: 9hr-deliberations consisted mostly of prolonged discussions \[evaluating evidence + trial testimony, or lack there of\], not argumentative disagreements (among jurors). Ultimately, the jury found brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo more credible than Jussie.",chicago,1939,1639092239.0,678,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/rcu6vz/breaking_jussie_smollett_found_guilty/
Sucker punched on the red line - Update,"Just wanted to update people on the past week I had after getting punched in the jaw at the Clark and Division station. Here's the original post ;


https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/sya6hf/sucker_punched_on_the_red_line/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I've spent the past week dealing with beat cops, detectives and the courts but have come up short. Can't get charges brought against my assailant even though he freely admitted to sucker punching me along with others and the whole thing was on CTA security cameras. Was told he has a lengthy rap sheet already. I know that I'll draw ire and vitriol from certain people because I was expecting some type of consequence for his actions as opposed to being dumped off for evaluation only to be released to do the same or God forbid worse to someone else. I pleaded with a Chicago police officer at the court to see a representative to try and get charges. I told her ""I'm an immigrant here, my wife is an immigrant too. She was attacked at the Howard station last year &amp; now I've been attacked at Clark &amp; Division, nothing was done for either of us. We have  an 18 month old at home and another on the way. I don't know if we want to raise children here "". Her blunt reply was "" then leave"". I love Chicago but this whole experience has tainted that immensely, it's almost as worse as the attack itself. I don't feel a sense of pride in it and very let down by the aftermath. The city has gone to the dogs and I don't see it getting better anytime soon.

About Chicago's climate change lawsuit against the oil companies...,"TLDR at the top cause this is gonna be a bit in depth:

1. Climate change costs Chicago a ton of money.

2. Corporations use emotionally charged issues, like ""the CTA sucks,"" to make attacks against them ""controversial."" 

3. And by the way, Chicago would have more money to spend on the CTA if it wasn't spending so much on the side effects of climate change.

Now the long bit:

Back in 1995, I was confused by the sudden appearance of parked white tractor trailers on my way to work every morning.

Turned out they were full of bodies. The morgue couldn't process them fast enough.

[739 people died *in 5 days* from a heatwave.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_Chicago_heat_wave) (Yes, climate change was already happening in 1995. This was the first time on record the dew point was high when the heat was.)

So climate change in Chicago is kind of a personal issue for me.

Here's the thing:

Climate change costs the city big bucks. Floods, polar vortexes, heatwaves, etc. [all break shit. Lots of it.](https://studentorgs.kentlaw.iit.edu/ckjeel/2022/10/01/chicago-is-losing-its-duel-with-climate-change/) Expensive infrastructure that needs repairing. 

[Lake Michigan is predicted to be 17"" higher by 2050.](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/great-lakes-water-levels-could-increase-average-75-17-inches-next-few) It's gonna cost a ton to protect the city from that.

Buildings in the loop [are *sinking*.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-silent-hazard-is-sinking-buildings-and-it-will-only-get-worse/) That's an expensive fix.

On a human scale, heatwaves cause [more violence](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ariannajohnson/2023/07/06/heres-why-warm-weather-causes-more-violent-crimes-from-mass-shootings-to-aggravated-assault/). More migrants [(or as Shell Oil called them *in the 1991* ""greenhouse refugees."")](https://youtu.be/0VOWi8oVXmo?feature=shared&amp;t=662) More need for heat-smoke-cold shelters.

This all costs money. 

Which leaves *less* for fixing stuff like the CTA.

One thing struck me about yesterday's post and the way it was instantly diverted to a discussion of the CTA: that jujitsu move of making the issue controversial by changing what it's about. It's an old tobacco industry tactic.

Use emotionally charged issues as diversionary tools to make laws and lawsuits controversial.

So when an office indoor smoking ban is proposed, you lean into a  [polarizing class war about rank](https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=kzlw0051) between the higher ups with private offices (who could presumably smoke) against the grunts in open air cubicles. *(see page 2)*

The ban on smoking in bars becomes an overreach that will put [""the mom and pop"" bar owner out of business](https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=skdj0053) (we all know how that one went, business got better than ever).

And last, but not least, smoking bans in public places become about [""MY FREEDOM.""](https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/#id=xlcg0128)

That's a discussion of oil companies and financial damage from climate change is transformed into a rant about how bad the CTA is and how the mayor's priorities are all screwed up, so everyone agrees the lawsuit is stupid.

So next time someone tries to head fake you into connecting poor CTA service to a new lawsuit or law the city is pursuing:

Got mugged last night on the Green Line…,"Stupid me for having my phone out. I was taking the westbound Green Line (to Oak Park) home from work last night, around 5:45pm. There were a few people on the train, but I was just twiddling around on my iPhone and admittedly not paying much attention. 

I saw a couple guys get on at Pulaski but didn’t pay them any mind. As we got to the Cicero stop, one of the guys shoved me back in my seat, yelled in my face, grabbed my phone out of my hand, and took off out the doors.  I stood up and looked out to see him running down the platform, but the doors were closing and I knew it was pointless to chase after him. No idea what happened to the other guy.

The other passengers asked if I was ok and offered to call the police, but I told them not to bother, I know they won’t do shit and it was my fault for being careless and not paying attention. 

I got home about 20 mins later, and was able to use my iPad to lock &amp; disable my phone, and contact my family and friends to let them know what happened.  I checked my bank accounts, nothing had been taken, and I changed my passwords. I took today off work, and went to get a new phone.

The incident shook me up, but I’m ok. Just wondering if I should even bother reporting it. I tried filing an online report, but got an email saying it was considered a “strong arm robbery” and would need to be filed over the phone. I called 311 but was just put on hold forever.

I know they won’t find my phone or the guy who took it. Honestly, I barely saw what he looked like myself. I’m still kinda shocked, but learned a valuable lesson… and I’ll be driving or taking the Metra to work from now on.",chicago,996,1644621313.0,75,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/sqcjhg/got_mugged_last_night_on_the_green_line/
Police Leaders Agree to Suspend Sergeant for Violating Rights of Black Driver During Downtown Traffic Stop,"Right-wing rage baiters like ChicagoContrarian &amp; CWBChicago deluge social media with violent crime outliers. At the same time, CPD refuses to comply with its binding Consent Decree and still unconstitutionally targets innocent Chicagoans, the very practices that led to the consent decree.

Even if these cops found incriminating evidence, the illegal tactics would cause it to be thrown out, and the cycle continues. Prosecutors cannot keep criminals in jail, and our budget problems worsen due to over a billion dollars in misconduct settlements.

"""NoCrimeNovember"" Post-Mortem Review - and changes to our moderation policies","Hi folks - on behalf of the /r/chicago mod team, we hope you all had a great Thanksgiving and are having a good holiday season so far.

As November has come to a close, it's time to discuss the results of our [“No Crime November”](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/qmnbac/announcing_nocrimenovember/) experiment and how we plan to moderate crime-related posts going forward.
 
To review, the problems we set out to solve with NCN were:
 
* The volume of crime posts on the front page drowning out discussion of other topics of interest to the r/chicago userbase
 
* The routinely negative quality of the discussion surrounding such threads, with ensuing impact on the overall atmosphere of the subreddit
 
* A potential over-representation of such threads resulting from the actions of brigading groups
 
Without further ado, our analysis:

---
 
###WHAT WORKED WELL
 
* *Frontpage Improvements*  - Users immediately began to report increased satisfaction with the content on our front page.  We've seen an explosion of interesting discussion threads, local interest stories, and cool pictures that otherwise might have fallen by the wayside. In addition to the effects of NCN, we also loosened our restrictions on what sorts of posts were allowed on the main /r/chicago page vs in the Weekly Casual Conversation and Questions Thread.
 
* *Reduced Slapfighting* - Subjectively, we've experienced a dramatic drop in the number of personal attacks and arguments we've had to adjudicate.  If you'd like some objective numbers, in October, human mods had to remove 2,392 comments for violating subreddit rules.  At time of writing, we've had to remove 1,391 comments in November, an almost 50% reduction in the quantity of rule-breaking comments.
 
* *Subreddit Vibe* - From the moment NCN was implemented and throughout the month, we have received overwhelmingly positive feedback about the new quality of the subreddit. 
 
###WHAT DIDN'T WORK WELL
 
*Messaging.*

* Our initial post did not adequately explain the criteria for allowed and not-allowed posts under the new rule (i.e. that this new policy primarily targeted violent and petty crime events that targeted an individual or group of individuals rather than affecting the greater city)

* We did not adequately convey that this rule only applied to top-level posts, and that no new restrictions would apply to discussions in comment threads.

* We did not discuss consequences for breaking this rule at length, leading some users to erroneously believe they would be punished for violations beyond simply having the offending post removed.
 
---
 
###CHANGES TO OUR MODERATION POLICIES AND THE SUBREDDIT RULES
 
Due to the success of the trial period, we have decided to enact the following permanent changes, effective immediately:
 
###**1. Crime Posts**
 
***The following types of crime-related posts are not allowed, and will be removed:***
 
* “Crime Recap” posts (e.g. articles with titles such as “10 People Shot Across Chicago Last Weekend”)
 
* Posts about a violent or petty crime targeting private individual(s) without greater impact on the Chicago area (e.g. a news article about someone being shot, carjacked, robbed, etc.)

* Posts that use crime-related dogwhistles to bait users (e.g. “We need to talk about crime in Chicago. This city is out of control! Kim Foxx needs to go!”, etc.) *(EDIT: fixed wording to be more clear)*

***The following crime-related posts are still allowed at moderator discretion:***

* Crimes involving a high-profile public figure in Chicago (e.g. an alderman being charged with corruption, the owner of a prominent business being accused of assault, etc.). *NOTE: Multiple posts about the same event are not allowed unless they represent significant developments in the story (e.g. daily Jussie Smollett trial updates are not allowed)*

* Crimes committed by a government official in their capacity as such (eg corruption, misconduct, etc.)

* Crimes that have a broad impact on the city (e.g. terror attacks, riots, crimes resulting in protests, etc.). *NOTE: In some cases, discussion of significant events may be restricted to a single megathread.*

*  Articles from trusted news sources that discuss the effects of crime at a high level may be allowed at moderator discretion (e.g. an article from the Tribune or Sun Times about how X crime rose over the course of the year may be allowed)

We will be updating Rule 10 to reflect this change in policy.

###**2. Questions/Conversation Posts**

*We will be allowing high-quality discussion threads outside of the Weekly Casual Conversation &amp; Questions Thread, and will be encouraging threads that meet the following criteria:*

* Question posts that ask an open-ended, discussion-driven question (think /r/AskReddit-style posts but specific to Chicago)

- Recommendations requests with well-defined criteria that local Chicagoans would find interesting (e.g. A post titled “best non-deepdish pizza restaurants in Chicago” would be allowed, but a post titled “visiting Chicago, where should I eat” would be redirected to the weekly questions thread). *Please note that we will expect users to search the subreddit for the question prior to asking, and in some cases may remove the question if it was asked previously*

- Discussion posts that share a fun fact about Chicago (*e.g. TIL Austin was ceded to Chicago by Cicero for allowing the L to extend into Oak Park*), talks about an issue currently pertinent to Chicago (*e.g. “The election is coming up, here’s how to register to vote”*), or shares information that is otherwise relevant or interesting to Chicagoans (*e.g. “the newly rebuilt intersection at x and y streets is dangerous because of z factors”*)

*The following posts are still not allowed on the main page and, in some cases, may be redirected to the Weekly Casual Conversation &amp; Questions Thread:*

* Posts asking for generalized recommendations (e.g. “visiting Chicago, what to do?”) 

* Posts looking for friends or social groups 

* Rants or low-effort discussion posts (e.g. a hot-take about a member of a Chicago sports team)

* Witch-hunts or posts trying to find out information about a specific individual (e.g “John Smith at 123 Oak Street was my neighbor back in 2003, does anyone know him?”)

* General posts about moving to or visiting Chicago (*NOTE: the [r/Chicago Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/wiki/index) has a lot of useful information about visiting or moving to Chicago*)

* Questions that can easily be answered by Google, or questions that are specialized in a way that only benefits the person asking it (e.g. “What time does the Mariano’s in Lakeview close on Wednesdays?”, or “How much should my gas bill be in a garden unit for the month of February?”)

Ultimately the decision of what is or isn’t allowed is at the discretion of the moderator, but we will try our best to operate under the criteria outlined above.

---

Finally, we do want to thank everyone for the feedback (both positive and negative) we received through the [NCN thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/qmnbac/announcing_nocrimenovember/), comments in other threads, and private modmail messages. We did read and consider all feedback when deciding on our next steps. Ultimately, we feel that our November experiment has had an overwhelmingly positive impact on the /r/chicago subreddit, and it is our hope that this community continues to trend in a more positive direction with the new rules in place.

We understand that this new policy, as with NCN, will not be popular with everyone in the community. For those of you who want a new place on reddit to discuss crime in Chicago, there are several other Chicago-related subreddits that allow discussion of individual crime events, and we encourage you to post crime-related content that is no longer allowed in /r/chicago to those communities instead.

Once again, we'd like to thank everyone for their suggestions, feedback, support, and continued trust.",chicago,0,1638332743.0,581,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/r66a91/nocrimenovember_postmortem_review_and_changes_to/

Best Friend Was Violently Mugged @ Halsted &amp; Clark Last Night: Warning and Questions,"My best friend is a restaurant manager downtown that regularly gets out of work after 2am. Last night he was walking from the Belmont Red Line to his home near Clark and Diversey, walking down Clark to where it meets Halsted, near the shopping plaza with DSW. An SUV did a u-turn, pulled up beside him and 2 Latino men got out of the car, one choked him against the brick wall while the other grabbed his wrists and proceded to hold him in some kind of wrestling hold while the choker took his briefcase and searched his pockets for his wallet. They then hit him and took off in the SUV.

My friend immediately called the police and made a police report. He gave them the license plate #, which came back to a completely different car (probably stolen plates). 

He is now going to talk to some of the stores to see if they have video surveillance of what happened.

Just wanted to warn everyone because I feel guilty bragging about how safe I feel in Lakeview in another post. My friend was completely sober and walking on a busy street in front of a huge shopping mall and this happened to him. Granted it was almost 3am and he was in a suit, which probably made him stand out as a target, but still :-( Also, if anyone has any advice for dealing with this, it would be much appreciated. All credit cards are cancelled.

Thanks for reading all that and STAY SAFE!



Edit: UPDATE- Someone just called his job (presumably off one of his business cards) and he was put in touch with ""Junior"" who lives on the far south side and ""found his stuff"". I told him to have him meet him at an el stop and to call the police and have them present. Not sure what's going to happen with that...hopefully he can get his stuff back. I will keep you posted, Reddit!


Edit: UPDATE 2- First off, thank you to everyone who took the time to read this and offer advice. My friend is still playing phone tag with the person who ""found his briefcase"". He works 80 hours/week, so he doesn't really have time at the moment (especially the weekend) to deal with it but he will hopefully be meeting up with him tomorrow on his day off.

A few important points I would like to address from all the comments:

- I believe in conceal and carry. I am mad at everyone downvoting the people who are making valid points regarding CCW. I was raised in a police officer family and I know for a fact that the police support CCW because they know that the thugs that are robbing people in the nice neighborhoods are not using guns. And if they do, they are not loaded and just for intimidation. Gangbangers may be stupid in a lot of senses, but they are not trying to get life sentences to steal an iPhone. The guys with guns are staying in their own neighborhoods and shooting rival gangbangers. 
I think the licensing process should be ultra strict and require extensive training. Ideally, I would love to live in a society that had no guns...like pretty much every other first world country. But that is not the reality we live in.

- ""If I am related to so many police, why can't I help my friend more?"" In case you're asking that, the answer is that without an actual license plate, they can't do anything. Because his phone wasn't taken, the total value of stuff stolen was under $100 and he didn't require any medical attention. There really isn't much that they can do.

- Things that my friend can do to prevent this from happening again: Bring a change of clothes to work so that he isn't coming home late in a nice suit. NOT walk around listening to music on his headphones late at night so that he is more aware of his surroundings. Keep his money/credit cards/id in a separate clip and keep a wallet that is for holding business cards and his Jewel preferred card and coupons/other crap that can be easily replaced. Get some mace. For the record, pepper spray and mace are 2 different things and mace is illegal in Cook County, but as I already said, the police won't arrest you for using mace against an attacker. 


Again, I am glad so many people took the time to read this. My intention was to make everyone aware that with summer comes a huge spike in crime. And the ONLY thing that is going to solve this is to get more police on the streets. Please don't blame the CPD. They are extremely over-worked. Blame our asshole mayor and all of our asshole aldermen for taking all the money from the highest taxed city in the country and misappropriating the funds. We don't need a new fucking megaplex for DePaul basketball. We need more police on the streets.

There's some more stuff for you to all discuss. Happy Monday!",chicago,132,1370716406.0,149,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1fxrvk/best_friend_was_violently_mugged_halsted_clark/

Got attacked by a crackhead on the redline yesterday. Anyone have a similar experience riding the L?,"I was taking the redline towards Howard today and while the train was stopped at Grand/State a man who looked like he was in his thirties walked up behind me and punched me in the back of the head. (It might have just been a really hard slap but Im not sure since I dont have eyes in the back of my head) i got up in shock and asked him ""did you just hit me? What the fuck is wrong with you dude?"". Saying that was probably a huge mistake on my part. He responds be screaming ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU??"" He then steps towards me and everyone including myself rushes off the train and the man ran out of the car and out of the station. The weird thing about this is he didnt try to rob me, he wasnt interested in taking my headphones or my iphone. The guy was just fucking crazy. He started running and I called 911 because I was absolutely fucking pissed and I wanted the man arrested. Sadly he ran out of the station and all I could do was file a police report over the phone. The station manager I talked to told me that the only way he would be arrested is if the cops caught him doing something live which is fucking bullshit but at the same time understandable considering the police have more serious crimes to investigate.  The attack was unprovoked, I didn't notice him until right after he hit me. I think the reason why he decided to hit me might have been because I was talking on the phone, but thats not a reason to throw a cheap shot at someone. Whatever, Im just glad he didn't seriously injure me or take any of my belongings.  Has anyone else on here seen or been the victim of something like this?

My sister was attacked while jogging on the 606 this evening.

Two men came to her aide and not only helped calm her down but made sure she got to her car safely. 

My sister, obviously in her state of distress, didn't get their number or their last names. We did find one of the Good Samaritan on Facebook but we're having trouble finding the the other person. 

I know this is a long shot but I thought I'd reach out to reddit for help. 

I cannot express in words how grateful I am for your actions. Please DM me if this was you or if you know who this may be. 

This is the last thing you want to happen to you or your loved ones. Please do not ignore screams of help or be afraid to step in. I can't thank you both enough for turning back and stopping to help my sister. 

Again, please DM me if this was you. This happened on the evening of 1/4. Thank you. 

-edit-

I wanted to thank everyone for your concerns. My sister did file a police report. The police showed up fairly quickly and were nice according to her. 

The attack happened 1/10 mile west of the Humboldt overpass, a fairly well lit area.

Got robbed near UIC tonight- be careful!,"From the flyer I posted around the neighborhood afterwards:

I was robbed tonight right at the front door of my apt between the East and West campuses of UIC by a young black man in a huge white SUV with silver detail, between 5:10 and 5:20pm. Here are the details so you can hopefully protect yourself from a similar situation.

**What happened**: I was walking home (with my headphones on like an IDIOT b/c I was really digging ""Call Your Girlfriend"" after discovering it last night) when I was right about to go inside the front door. This huge white SUV pulls up to the corner and stops, and as soon as I whip my keys out this dude runs up to me, pushes me against the door, rips my purse off of me, it breaks, and he runs back to his car, I say, ""Seriously??"" (LOL), and he peals out headed East on Harrison. 

**What he looks like**: young black man, 18-23, ~5’10”, slender to medium build, had a skullcap black hat and baggy clothes. Didn’t notice any crazy hair or facial hair.

I was lucky enough to have someone return my phone to me almost immediately b/c he threw it out the window at Loomis and Harrison. *However, I still haven’t recovered my wallet/purse/IDs/$/CCs etc. I already cancelled my cards but it would be nice to have them and the other stuff back, so if you see a discarded Nine West brown leather over-the-shoulder purse, or brown wallet with a “La Brea Tarpits” sticker laying around it might be mine.* 

Please be careful walking home and I guess especially about vehicles that seem to be driving next to you (I don’t think he was tailing me for long or I would have flipped out). I think if I hadn’t had my headphones on I might have noticed the car sooner so that’s what I won’t do from now on. 

TO THE WOMAN WHO FOUND AND RETURNED MY PHONE: THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!! If you can tell me a few details to verify you were the person who returned it I will be glad to buy you coffee to thank you =)

P.S. The people in the apartment upstairs were super nice and let me call the cops after I explained I had been robbed (between shaking like a leaf and trying not to collapse). The UIC police officers were also extremely kind and helpful, letting me use one of their phones to call my bank and cancel my cards immediately. The robber used my card at the Shell on Racine and Van Buren (for a $1 wtf hahaha) and I've already filed to have the charge removed. 

I'm just glad it didn't end like [this](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx7x5uuHlk1r9yinio1_500.jpg), at gunpoint.

I also met the NBC Chicago guy filming near where it happened and after asking him what he was filming he told me it was for the UIC student who was attacked (me).

"Hi, I'm thinking of moving from Melbourne, Aus to Chicago soon and have a few questions...","Ever since I visited Chicago on holiday when I was a kid, I've always wanted to eventually live in your wonderful city permanently. Anyway, I've just finished uni and am finally at the stage in my life where I can actually pack my bags and catch a plane. Lately though, I've been doing some research and I'm starting to really reconsider things.

1. From what I understand, the most dangerous part of town is the South Side, but how safe is the city, overall? You guys must be sick of hearing about how 'dangerous' your city is and I've always suspected it's a bit overblown - especially here in Australia where the prevailing opinion is that most Americans are hyperviolent loons who eat bullets with their cereal - but all the statistics I've read are quite sobering. How common are 'non-gang related murder' sort of crimes (like buglary, carjacking, muggings etc.), especially in okay parts of town?
2. What kind of rent will I be looking to pay if I want to live in a part of town that's safe, affordable, and reasonably close to the CBD? I sort of have an idea of rent prices for a couple of places, but the names of the suburbs don't really mean much to me without the context that comes from being a resident there.
3. Lastly, how's the live music scene here? Is there a good local music scene? ",chicago,17,1345885046.0,52,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/yst8g/hi_im_thinking_of_moving_from_melbourne_aus_to/

"Anyone here lived in or from Washington DC? Potentially making the move, and wondering how the two cities compare.","I moved to Chicago 4 years ago and absolutely fell in love with the city. I saw myself living here at least throughout my 30s (25 now), but as the old story goes, I met a girl.

She has a pretty amazing career opportunity with an old colleague in the DC metro area that would require us to move there in 2018 and we are trying to weigh the pros and cons of the two cities. I would be able to work remotely with my current company and would be able to find something similar in that area if need be (I’ve also thought about pivoting career wise by getting an MBA and Georgetown would be easier to get into over Northwestern or Booth).

We are doing our own research but wanted to get anyone’s POV if possible.
I had a questions on the following:

Neighborhoods - How do the neighborhoods there compare to here in Chicago? We currently live in Bucktown and mainly stick to WP, West Loop and Logan when going out. 

Public Transit - From what I’ve read, you could live in DC without a car and get around using their transit system. However, I’ve also read that it’s worse than the CTA. Would you say that’s the case?

Big City Feel - I love the fact that I live such a big city, every time I see the skyline I get a little smile on my face. How is the transition from a smaller city like DC? 

Social Scene/East Coast People - I’ve never had a problem striking up a conversation at a bar here in Chicago and the majority of people I’ve met here are cool. Is it easy to make friends in DC, is it like any other larger city?

Weather - I’ve been getting mixed signals on the weather in DC, some say it’s only better because of Chicago winters, but I actually don’t mind them too much. I’m pretty worried about the summers, I am not a fan of humidity, but is it comparable to Chicago summers?

Crime - Every neighborhood in the city has seen a rise in crime this year (muggings and carjackings), so we have definitely been more aware of our surroundings just walking around our hood. Is it more or less the same DC area?

These were the big ones I had questions on, but if you had any other input it would be great! Probably the other thing would be cost of living but salary wise we would be making way more and be able to live just as comfortably.

Plan on posting on /r/washingtondc as well. TIA!",chicago,17,1514410472.0,27,https://reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/7mhyyb/anyone_here_lived_in_or_from_washington_dc/

I am wondering what are the motivations for murders in Chicago? 

The illegal drug trade is always a source of conflict, and I support legalizing all drugs, but based on descriptions of the crimes that have occurred it doesn't seem to me like drug dealing turf wars are the cause of nearly all of the murders.

One of the most blatant examples of Chicago Corruption,"""At a CAPS meeting last August, a resident asked why criminal arrestees list local service agencies such as the Center on Halsted as their “home.”

Officer Tom Walsh, who was leading the meeting, stated that he had been in the police district for many years and he had never seen the Center on Halsted listed as an offender’s home address.

A CWB Chicago editor in the audience rolled his eyes at that statement. Smith had used the Center as his home address twice already in 2016.

When Walsh is not working for the police department, he runs a private security firm. The firm received $137,850 from the Center on Halsted for security services in 2014 and another $136,793 for security services in 2015, according to the Center’s tax records.

Predictions for Chicago Crime?,"I've lived in Chicago for decades, and always downplayed the crime. Even this year I would tell people that it's not that bad, but this summer has been brutal. We all know about the shootings, but everything is way up. The amount of friends I know who have experienced car jackings and muggings is ridiculous. It seems obvious that this all corresponds to a huge decrease in police activity. At first, I was sympathetic, but now, it's just time to do the job you're getting paid to do. I was hoping things picked back up as the year went on, but no. 

Is this the new normal for the city? Will it be this way until after the MacDonald trial is over. Will the CPD work on getting rid of the ACLU paperwork?

First-hand Chicago crime stories?,"I have two pretty good ones.  They both happened outside work, since I work at a couple elementary schools in high-crime 'urban' neighborhoods.

The first time I don't remember at all; whatever information I do have is second-hand.  I remember leaving work and the next thing I know I'm in a hospital four hours later and a doctor is telling me I had the most severe amnesia he had ever seen.  According to my roommate and the police I was hit once or twice from behind and my bag was stolen (though had nothing of value inside).  I spent a few hours in the police station and was dropped off at home, where I proceeded to repeat the same questions to my roommate every ten seconds and didn't seem to remember the last few months at all.  I wasn't seriously hurt and got all my memory back (I think) except for those four hours where I don't remember a GD thing.

The second was more brutal, something I would love to forget.  I was walking home from work and there were several 18-ish black boys and girls on the corner laughing and dancing--seeming to have a good time--and suddenly, as I went to walk by, four or five of the males jumped on me and beat the shit out of me until a bystander intervened.  My nose, jaw, and some ribs were broken, I had a hole in my lip, and was covered in bruises, especially on my right side.  Nothing was stolen, it was purely recreational.  I was in somewhat severe pain for some weeks after and had to deal with anxiety for quite a bit longer.  Still teaching.

"What is Edgewater like? Or, other neighbourhood suggestions.","Today I am going to Apartment Finders to check out some places. I told the gentleman on the phone my price range, and he said that we'd focus our search on Edgewater. I've lived in Wicker Park, Lincoln Park, Roscoe Village, and Lincoln Square. These are all great areas, but I think out of my price range now.(Recently quit job to go back to school, living on savings and eating ramen.) I am almost completely ignorant on what kind of neighbourhood Edgewater is, and honestly most other neighbourhoods. I've lived in Chicago most of my life, but I am still pretty young and haven't paid much attention to other areas. How would you describe Edgewater? Is it nice? i.e. low crime, no hoodlums hanging around on corners, low amount of graffiti, etc. Is it crowded? Do they have a lot of street festivals in summer? Are there lots of cute little shops or is it mostly residential?

Alternatively can you suggest another area that I should look? I would prefer to stay on the north side, since my school and most of my friends are up here. My main focus is cheap and ""a low crime area"". I want to be able to come home after dark and not worry(too much) about being mugged, but still have the lowest rent possible. I am willing to sacrifice on size, a dishwasher, in-building laundry, parking(I actually don't own a car)- pretty much everything else in exchange for these two things.

The last time I asked for a suggestion on a new neighbourhood, I was told Albany Park by many people. I took that advice, and my last apartment was tagged on a regular basis, my boyfriend's car was broken into 3 times in 2 months, and we had police on our corner at least once a week to break up fights and arrest drug dealers. I am currently staying with a friend in Lincoln Park, and he gave me til September to get off his couch, which I am eager to do.

So with this in mind, where do you suggest I look, or what can you tell me about Edgewater?

&gt;between 7/1/1917 and 3/1/1921, there were 58 white terrorist bombings of black homes and the homes of black and white realtors who sold or rented property to blacks in exclusively white areas, 46 of which occurred from 1919-1921 (pp. 122-123)

&gt;the home and office of Jesse Binga, a local realtor who dared to sell homes to blacks in white areas, were bombed 7 different times (p. 123)

&gt;many of the attacks came with warnings, which were reported to the police who largely ignored them (pp. 123-124)

&gt;”the gangs and ‘athletic clubs’ became more boldly active in the Spring of 1919. on the night of June 21st, 5 weeks before the riot, there were two wonton murders of negros by gangs of white hoodlums…a number of white youths approached the [black] man, woman, and child, one of the gang saying ‘let’s get that n*gger’…there is evidence that the [white] gangs in the neighborhoods of these crimes had spread such fear among negro residents that murders of this kind were not unexpected.” (pp. 55-56)

All of this had a dual purpose: to keep the neighborhoods adjacent to the overcrowded black ghetto pure white, and to sow terror in the black community by making it clear that disrupting the social order of residential apartheid will be met with white violence

"You guys have been great, so I want to know your opinions on Bronzeville.","I know it a higher crime area, and it's not very racially diverse (somewhere around 80% black) but the real estate is affordable, and we could have easy access to public transportation and downtown. Should I really be worried about crime rates and school quality? 
 
Also, as my wife and I are decidedly *not* black, should we expect to be welcomed as part of the community? Would we be making ourselves targets for harassment or muggings? 
 
I don't mean to sound naive, but I just think these neighborhoods will never improve if educated, friendly, hard working people refuse to live there. And it would be nice to live in a low-cost decent sized place near downtown. 
 
What are your thoughts and experiences with Bronzeville?

Walking to School Horror Story from this Morning,"Two months ago I moved to Chicago  from the west coast. Coming from the quiet suburbs of San Francisco, I've always been a little wary while walking outside in Chicago. I've heard stories of violence, perpetrated out in the open against innocent and unassuming pedestrians; the fact that crime has always been sequestered within the inner city back in SF has only heightened my anxiety of encountering criminals. Anyways, I live in East Pilsen, which has been deemed a relatively safe neighborhood by reddit's consensus. However, after my morning commute to school, I would beg to differ because I was assaulted. On the sidewalk, A woman and I were walking in convergent directions. She was short in stature, and so were the two dogs she was walking. Upon first glance, she seemed to cast off any suspicion of being a criminal, unfortunately her seemingly unassuming visage would betray her malicious disposition. As the distance between us drew closer, one of her dogs began to bark and then it bit me. It stung, and since the dog was on one of those leashes that slackens and extends when the leash is pulled, I couldn't evade the attack. So it's about one full second before I am able to pull my leg away by walking two steps in the direction of my normal commute. I don't dare say a word to the woman because I am late for school, and also she is hispanic and I know that there is gang activity in Pilsen and I worry that if I tell her off, a gang member may see me encroaching upon their territory. You could say that I'm kind of in a tricky situation right now. Here is a link to the picture of the dog bite. Luckily, I was wearing jeans and long underwear.

"Can we be grownups: Will I be ""safe"" in these neighborhoods?","Hi folks!

I've never been to your lovely city, but it's being recommended to me, at least as a lovely summer get-away from my west-coast desert home.

I need honest yet respectful answers. You can answer a simple Yes or No, if you'd like. Here's what I need to know:

The following neighborhoods have been recommended to me, based on my interests, lifestyle, and age (mid 50s, Gen-X).

**Lincoln Park:** Sophisticated / Mature

**Andersonville:** Neighborly / Arts

**Hyde Park:** Intellectual / Lakefront

**Ravenswood**

Here's my concern: I'm a black woman. I know there are traditional 'black' neighborhoods, but I'm looking at an overall lifestyle fit. I'm a creative artist, I'm introverted, and I like the arts/culture scene, great food, farmer's markets, community events -- this type of thing.

I ask because I keep hearing that Chicago is notoriously segregated, and I want to make sure that I will be safe if I move into these areas, or any.

For context: I'm originally from an east coast city, so I understand not being welcomed in certain neighborhoods. There were/are certain neighborhoods I just knew to stay away from. I didn't hang out in them, I didn't shop or eat there. I just avoided these areas and did my thing in more ... integrated areas, let's just say.

So -- Should I give these areas a chance, or avoid them? Thank you.",AskChicago,0,1769584278.0,40,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1qp4hk4/can_we_be_grownups_will_i_be_safe_in_these/
Is it actually safe to walk around Chicago right now with all these ICE reports?,"Hey everyone — I’m a legal immigrant living in Chicago (on an H-1B visa, so fully authorized to be here). But lately I’ve seen tons of posts and news stories about ICE raids in Little Village, Cicero, and other neighborhoods. Reddit and TikTok are full of people saying that ICE is detaining random folks just for “looking Hispanic,” and honestly, I’m getting scared to even go outside or take the train.

Can anyone local tell me how things really are on the ground?
	•	Are people actually being stopped randomly in public?
	•	Which neighborhoods have had confirmed ICE activity recently?
	•	Is it safer to carry copies of my immigration papers, or would that make things worse?

I love this city and just want to know how to stay safe and calm during all this chaos. Any firsthand experiences or verified info from Chicago locals would mean a lot right now.

Hello everyone- thank you in advance for answering if you can. I’ve lived in Illinois most of my life. I grew up in Homewood, then moved to Oak lawn until divorce and eventual apartment in Willowbrook.

How do I convince my folks that moving to Chicago is not a death sentence?,"I'll keep this a bit short, but my partner and I are two queer women living in Texas. For probably a dozen different reasons, we don't really feel comfortable or safe here anymore, and would like to move. We picked Chicago because it's a big city, with a lot of culture and nightlife, and its relatively close to a lot of family and friends that I have.

My dad, and my MIL, seem convinced that it's basically Night City, that no matter where we go we're going to get horribly murdered. Every time we have dinner with my MIL, she tells us she's not comfortable with us moving there. She doesn't even watch Fox, I don't know what the deal is. We're 2 months out and she tried to convince us to switch gears to Colorado despite the fact that we know absolutely no one there and a person we're moving with already has a job in Chicago.

We've told her that we know which neighborhoods are safe, that we've talked to locals, that its the third largest city in the country so of course it has crime, that OUR city has a crime problem too. Nothing seems to work, she's just swimming with anxiety, and my dad doesn't even know yet.

Safe/walkable neighborhoods near DePaul campus?,"I'm going to be starting at DePaul soon and am moving to Chicago from out of state. I'm trying to find somewhere that has a quick commute/walk to their Lincoln Park campus (I think this is where the art programs are) so that I can dip in and out multiple times a day if needed. Some stuff:

Early 30s, so I'm not looking to party, but I'm also single and don't want to be in the suburbs. I'd like to live somewhere I can easily get to food/coffee/etc, and next to public transport. I've always lived in small towns so I'd like somewhere that feels extra safe to walk home at night. I won't have a car (do people bike in Chicago or is it too cold?)

It needs to be trans friendly - I'm finally getting out after a lifetime of red states, and it would be a breath of fresh air to have somewhere I could relax and not be looking over my shoulder.

My absolute maximum is $1800 for a loft/1 bedroom (would prefer 1 bedroom). I'd like to have laundry in building and good heat/air. Is this a reasonable price?

I've seen people talk about Lincoln Park and Lakeview, but I don't know the differences between them. Safety and walkability are my main priorities. Thanks for reading

"Which Chicago neighborhoods would be best for a safe, walkable lifestyle with a great social and dating scene?","Hi!

I'm 27F, remote software engineer moving to Chicago from next year! I’d love some advice on the best neighborhoods to match my lifestyle!

Here's what I'm looking for:

* **Budget**: Up to $2,500/month for rent for a luxury 1 bedroom. I could go to up $2700 too.
* **Lifestyle**: I’d love to live in a high-rise with nice amenities and a professional crowd
* **Social Life**: I don't drink or smoke but would love to meet folks through meetup groups. I wanna explore my interest in writing so maybe I'd join some writing clubs, book clubs, or become a member at a museum. I am extroverted but usually lead a low-key life. Love to eat out and explore coffee shops or any events/markets that opened up for the season. I meditate and workout a lot too so could join groups for those.
* **Dating Scene**: I'm single and would actually love to start dating. Would love to meet guys off the apps (ideally) who are in their late 20s or early to mid 30s
* **Gym**: I'd love proximity to a top tier bodybuilding gym
* **Daily Essentials**: I'm coming from Arlington, VA where I didn't have a car. I can get a car but would ideally like to avoid dealing with maintaining a car in Chicago so walking proximity is essential. Would like to be within 5-10 mins walking distance from grocery stores.

Please let me know what the best month to move is too! Would it be Feb so I can possibly get a better deal on the rent?

I've been considering **Streeterville**, **Gold Coast**, **South Loop**, **Old Town**, and **River North** (with some concerns about the nightlife there). For those who know these areas, would they suit what I’m looking for, or is there another neighborhood I should be considering?

If any of you live in quieter parts of River North and have tips on finding buildings that avoid the bar noise and weekend crowds, I’d love to hear your experience!

Also, if you live in Chicago and wanna be friends, I'd love to e-meet you as well!

Should I move to Chicago?,"I’m a single 25 year old Black woman. I just accepted a job offer for 150k base that will require out of state relocation (also covered by the company).

What would you say to doubting parents about moving to Chicago?,"

We (late 20’s F) are moving to Chicago proper in the Jan-March months next year from Iowa- woohoo! 

I was raised in the suburbs, and my parents moved me out to Iowa due to the amazing school quality 20 years ago. 

Now? Iowa is not safe for LGBTQ individuals, and we are afforded so many more rights in Chicago- not to mention just the draw to live in a world class city! 

We will be moving to the northern neighborhoods, probably Rogers Park, North Park, Andersonville, or somewhere nearby. 

My mom grew up in Maywood in the 60’s-70’s, and moved out of the area in the 00’s. Times have changed, but she isnt thrilled at the idea. Says she only hears horror stories (aka media sensationalization). 

Obviously we know the areas we are moving to are safer than our current neighborhood in Iowa, but thats hard for my rural parents to wrap their head around (Note that my neighbors have been visited by SWAT, and my other neighbors have all been in violent domestic altercations. It is very common for cops to be on my block for multiple reason). We are not looking for their approval, nor do we need it, but if theres any way to calm their preconceived notions, it would help! 

What would you say to a couple of Boomers who have not been in the Chicago area for 20+ years that no, we will not be shot up in Chicago and we are going to very quaint neighborhoods in search for a better quality of life (we will be renting, so no arguments over property taxes LOL).

Moving to Chicago with a baby – condo + parking + transit advice?,"Hi everyone, my husband and I (30s) are considering a move to Chicago in the next year (late 2026 / early 2027) and would love some practical advice from people who actually live here.



We’re a family with a baby and are hoping to buy a 2BR condo around \~$350K. We know that budget comes with real tradeoffs, and we’re very open to evaluating them realistically (or rethinking our budget if what we’re looking for isn’t realistic).



What we’re flexible on:



* Older buildings
* Walk-ups (2nd or 3rd floor is fine)
* No fancy amenities (no pool, gym, doorman, etc.)
* Smaller buildings with fewer units. Our goal is to keep HOA fees reasonable, not pay for amenities we won’t use.





What we really need:



* In-unit washer and dryer
* Ideally \~ 1,200 sq ft; we don’t need a ton of space but I’ve seen some 2BR condos that are 800 sq ft and I think that might be too small
* Walkable neighborhood (grocery, pharmacy, park)
* Quieter, more residential feel (not nightlife-heavy) and safe
* Reasonable commute (45 mins or less) to the Loop (CTA, Metra, or bus)
* Parking for one car —  While great if parking were included, I understand that is very unlikely, so for this, we’re open to a garage/lot within 1–2 blocks that we can rent a space from (we’re trying to understand what’s realistic here)





Neighborhoods we’ve been researching so far:

North side:

* Lakeview, Lincoln Square, Edgewater
* Rogers Park, Albany Park

South side: 

* Bronzeville
* North Kenwood
* Hyde Park





A few specific questions:



1. Are there neighborhoods where condos in this price range more commonly include parking, or where nearby garage rentals are realistic? For families with one car, how do most people actually handle parking day-to-day?
2. Are there neighborhoods we should be considering that fit our overall profile but are often overlooked?





We’re not looking for perfection, just trying to understand what’s realistic before making a big move. Appreciate any insight, especially from parents or condo homeowners.



Thanks in advance!

Reverse Commute From City to Skokie 3x/week. Is This Tolerable Without a Car?,"Hi, I’m potentially moving to Chicago for my first post-grad job and would love some local insight.

I’m in the final stages for a hybrid job based in Skokie, near the Skokie Courthouse/Westfield Old Orchard area. The role would be in-office 3 days/week and ideally, I’d want to live in the city (initially looking at Lincoln Park, Lakeview East, Uptown, Edgewater, or Rogers Park).

My question: is a reverse commute from those neighborhoods to Skokie tolerable via public transportation? I’d likely be taking the L and a bus. I’d prefer not to bring a car because driving in the city feels stressful and parking is expensive, and I’d rather rely on transit if possible.

If that commute sounds miserable/unrealistic, are there any recommendations for neighborhoods/towns closer to Skokie that still feel good for someone in their early 20s or areas that are relatively safe, transit-accessible, and somewhat social?

I initially wanted to live in the city for the social aspect but I’m trying to be realistic about commute and quality of life. Appreciate any advice or firsthand experiences

Edit: Oh my god, I did not expect to receive this many comments LOL but I truly appreciate everyone’s opinions and pieces of advice!

Moving to Chicago: how are SW neighborhoods?,"As the title says, my wife and I are seriously thinking of moving to Chicago after visiting a few times. We love the Logan Square/Humboldt Park area, but it’s a little out of our price range to buy a home (max $300k). Are there other neighborhoods near the CTA or Metra that still keep us close to nice parks and walkable-ish neighborhoods? We like to ride our bikes, so being a little farther from a metro station is fine as long as we can lock our bikes up near the station.

I would also like the area to be safe enough that my wife can walk around by herself. We have lived in both Tucson (near DMAFB and Santa Rita High School) and St. Louis (Lemay, South City, and now Overland), so we know how to at least be aware of our surroundings.

"Asking for advice from Chicago parents, teachers or those who attended Chicago public schools recently (please see comment for details)?","My family is relocating to Chicago within the next two months and we have a 9 year old son who will be going into fourth grade. 

When we’re looking at places to rent and the schools they are zoned for, I’m confused why a neighborhood that is considered “safe” and “good” will have a rating of 2 or 3. And then neighborhoods that are considered “less safe” or “less desirable” have schools rated 6,7,8 etc. (Getting the ratings mostly off of great schools or similar sites). 

Example: a school in Logan Square (a neighborhood that seems to be rated highly) will zone for a 1/10 school where as a neighborhood like Kenwood which we haven’t seen as many high ratings on will have like a 7/10 school. 

So my question is how much do school ratings really mean? Does your kid go to a “low rated” school and learn a lot and have great experiences? Does your kid go to a “highly rated” school and you don’t notice much of a difference vs. other schools? Are these metrics based on safety, test scores, what? 

I promise I am not trying to be offensive and I understand that a lot of what I’m saying is generalizations and no area is completely good or bad and just because an area is “unsafe” doesn’t mean the students don’t do well etc. 

But I’m just confused because when we’re finding a rental we like that is in an area we like and has good space, etc. the school zone usually is lacking. 

For context, we currently live in Florida which usually is considered to not have great schools. Previously my son went to a 4/10 school and it was terrible, lots of classroom issues and he didn’t learn much the entire year (maybe it was just his teacher?). We then moved him to an 8/10 school and he learned a ton, went on a bunch of field trips, etc. I don’t know if that’s a coincidence or if the ratings really make that much of a difference. I also don’t know if northern schools are just better overall so maybe a Chicago 3 is a Florida 10 type of thing. 

Sorry for such a long post. Trying to condense while still adding details. I really mean no offense to anyone who lives in any part of the city or attends any type of school, just looking to be in a place we enjoy while making sure my son has a great school experience.

Has the percentage of kids get driven by parents to/from school in the city increased in recent years?,"I live on the north side of the city in a pretty safe area near a couple of public grammar schools and a couple of private grammar schools. My day often takes me past public high schools. It seems like in recent years, the number of cars parked to pick up or drop off students has skyrocketed. 3-4pm is like a gridlock in certain parts of my neighborhood, and it appears to be parents or guardians picking up kids in personal vehicles. Sometimes cars are lined up for more than a block. Of course, I see school buses too. But it just seems like an enormous number of kids get chauffeured to/from school these days.

Now, I have been working from home in recent years. So I'm more often in and around my neighborhoods during pick up hours, where in the past I would be commuting home at 5pm, much later than most school days end.

Is it a big trend to drive your kids to/from school every day? What percentage of kids would you estimate get this personal driving service? Has this really increased in recent years or is this just because I happen to notice it more? If so -- why? When did this start? Recently, or was this happening 10-20 years ago?

I'm 54 with no children. I do not remember many kids getting driven to or from school when I was in school -- except rarely. Not trying to yell at clouds here, but... what gives?

French girl moving to Chicago – What Should I Expect?,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 28-year-old woman from France, and I’m moving to Chicago this September for work and will be staying there for 18 months. I’m excited but also a bit nervous about this big change. I’ve never been there, only went twice in the US before (2 months in NYC and 1 in LA, loved it). I’d love to hear from locals and fellow transplants about what to expect. Here are a few specific questions I have:

**Neighborhood Recommendations:** Which neighborhoods would you recommend for someone in their late 20s? I’m looking for a place that’s safe, has a good social scene, and is reasonably close to public transportation (I'll be working 3 days a week in Des Plaines, 2days from home)

**Cultural Adjustments:** Are there any major cultural differences I should be aware of moving from France to Chicago?

**Social Life:** What’s the best way to meet new people and make friends in the city? Any recommended social groups or activities?

**Safety:** Are there any particular areas I should avoid? General safety tips would be greatly appreciated.

Merci in advance for your advice! Feel free to share any tips or thoughts you have on Chicago !

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your answers! Regarding the ""social life"" aspect, my goal is to bond with locals and Americans. I really want to immerse myself in the culture and I fear surrounding myself too much with other French or European people :)",AskChicago,101,1720349998.0,142,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1dxdx4x/french_girl_moving_to_chicago_what_should_i_expect/
Is It Safe Visiting Chicago Right Now with the Arrival of ICE Agents?,"I am flying out to Chicago for a three day trip to see some of the museums and landmarks, partially as a way to celebrate finishing college and because I have family in the area but have never been to the city proper. I've seen on the news that ICE has recently come into the city and are detaining and profiling people which makes me really nervous. I'm 23M and am white passing although I have a Korean last name and was born on a US military base outside of the country, so I am a legal citizen and am not the first person ICE would try to come after but I honestly wouldn't put anything past them.

For my trip next week I have a hotel booked near the Loop and will mostly hang around that neighborhood as well as the Navy Pier and Grant Park further south. Aside from seeing some of the museums and taking pictures of my visit,  I think my trip is fairly unassuming and just regular tourist stuff, but I'm also aware the timing of this trip is especially shit. I'm very upset that ICE is doing what they're doing and I know I am unlikely to be held up by them, but I planned this trip well ahead of time and have always wanted to visit.

TL;DR: Should I visit Chicago in the coming week or should I cancel my plans for the sake of safety? If I do visit, is there anything I should know or be wary of when I'm in town?

What Chicago suburb and schools to go for as Expat?,"I (M37) am relocating with my wife and 3 children (age 1, 6 and 8) to Chicago for a 3 year expat contract, moving out of Denmark. 

I am looking for any advice on which suburb/neighborhood and specific schools to aim for, if the requirements are the following: 

\- Safe neighborhood with preferably easy access to recreational facilities and with other families for us to build a network with. 

\- Budget for rent is 7,000 USD per month excl utilities for a minimum 4 br house unfurnished. 

\- Great schools in the area is a must. Can be both private or public. As two of my three children is at school age, this is of high importance. Tuition is not a parameter as company is paying, if needed - though we dont mind public schooling if school is good. 

\- Commute by either train or car to Ogilvie Transportation Center cannot be more than 45 mins

	•	Reasonable commute to the city (open to neighborhoods or nearby suburbs)

"Chicagoan's, Help a Texas Native looking to Move to your City with some General Questions?","I am 30(f) with a 6-year-old kiddo. I am a native Texan who has lived here all my life. I currently reside in Dallas and am looking to make a change. After the election results, I no longer feel particularly safe or comfortable here, especially as a woman with a daughter and a chronic illness.

After posting in a health-related sub on where to move, I narrowed it down to 3 locations, beautiful Chicago being my first choice so far.

I’d love to hear from others who moved to Chicago from elsewhere (bonus points if you moved from Texas), Chicago Natives, Chicago parents, Chicago women

The biggest thing beyond the move itself is probably winter. I have never really experienced a true winter outside of traveling, which is not the same as living in it. My MS causes pretty bad heat intolerance, so I am actually looking forward to bidding Texas summers adieu and experiencing some cold weather! However, I don’t know how to dress for serious cold - or how to drive in winter weather. It gets below 40 here, and we just shut it all down. (Kidding, kind of)

I currently live in a large city and would like it to remain that way, but I’m also aware that navigating the public school system in a large city can be difficult. Parents of little ones or parents who’ve already been through the process, I would greatly appreciate any advice or insight on schools/neighborhoods from y’all! This would be a huge change for my kiddo as well, and I want her to be happy. I know she’d love the idea of being close to a beach and the idea of snow (at least until it gets old; I hear it gets old, but to us, it’s like a world wonder)

Ladies of Chicago- neighborhoods you enjoy and neighborhoods you avoid? Where do you go to socialize? shop for groceries? shop for clothes? We are not Rockefeller’s by any means, so as far as living, I’m looking for cheap but still safe - (I know such places don’t really exist, where we live now is affordable-ish/mostly safe, something like that)

Hyde Park with Young Children ,"I'm sorry if this question has been asked before (I used the search tool and couldn't find what I was looking for).

My husband, three young children, and I are relocating to Chicago. We are strongly considering Hyde Park, due to convenience to my husband's new job at UC; however our realtor recommended Lakewood/Lincoln Park area instead. My husband said he doesn't mind the commute, as he is only expected to be on the campus 3 days per week; but I am wondering if Hyde Park could be a good fit for our family, given the convenience and excellent price point. 

We love city living, and convenience to 'stuff/amenities', lots of people, etc. However we also have young kids and want a safe, walkable neighborhood, where I can take my kids out to ride scooters/run around after dinner without safety issues. 

Also to note, we have been to Chicago to visit probably a dozen times, and absolutely loved it; however we only explored the Gold Coast/Lincoln Park area in the past, so I have no knowledge of any other areas.

Any information you could provide would be appreciated. Thanks so much.

Potentially moving for a tech job. Can Chicago locals tell me honestly about safety and quality of life during ICE occupation?,"Hi everyone,

  
I’m a Black woman in software and I have an upcoming job offer where my relocation options are Chicago or Denver. Chicago makes the most sense for my career, as most of my team is at this location; There’s more tech here and I really *like* the city from what I’ve seen so far. I’m currently visiting and have found a lot to appreciate about the culture, transit, lakefront, food, etc.

But I want to talk about something more serious and personal:

# My biggest concern is ICE activity and detainment.

I’ve heard about recent ICE raids and I’ve also heard stories of **Black teens and adults in Chicago being detained**, questioned, or harassed because of *assumptions* about their status. I know these situations also heavily impact Latinx communities, and I want to be clear: **It’s not okay for** ***any*** **community.** My concern is that **I’ve seen these harms cross racial lines** \- and I want to understand the *actual* risk of that here.

# So I really need locals’ insight:

* How real or common is ICE presence in day-to-day life here?
* Are there neighborhoods or situations where harassment or detainment is more likely to happen?
* Are there city policies or community practices that help people stay safe?
* Do you feel protected by Chicago’s sanctuary policies in practice, or is it more symbolic?
* As a Black woman who would be moving alone, what do I need to know to navigate the city safely?

# Context about me

I’ve lived in Atlanta and New Orleans - I’m *not* new to living in cities with crime or uneven policing. I’m not scared of living in a city. I’m specifically concerned about **misidentification, profiling, and detainment**, and how Chicagoans - especially Black and/or immigrant communities - navigate that reality. I've also been told by my recruiter that I could, say, go to Denver for a week and work at that office if I felt like it from time to time if I wanted a change of scenery, and it's the same way the other way around, so I've also considered living in Denver or Chicago fulltime and coming out a week here and there to either if Chicago is, say, too dangerous with ICE's presence.

I’ll also be asking Denver the same questions to get a complete picture. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to answer honestly.",AskChicago,0,1762093256.0,37,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1omihwv/potentially_moving_for_a_tech_job_can_chicago/

West Loop and the surrounding areas were cool, but I definitely prefer the neighborhoods further north in terms of architecture and things to do. West Loop feels a bit too sterile for me, and it’s also way outside my price range.

For context: I’m 24F, an artist, social, and physically active. I’m born and raised in NYC, so I understand city dynamics and that no neighborhood is 100% perfect in terms of safety. I’m looking for a fun but generally safe area for a woman in her mid-twenties living alone.

Ideally, I want a neighborhood that’s a bit slower-paced and more residential, but still has essential and social spots (grocers, bars, gyms, cafés, restaurants, etc.) and fun things to do within walking distance. Basically something similar to neighborhoods in Queens or Brooklyn.

I’d also love to avoid the newer, cookie-cutter white box apartments. I’m drawn to something more vintage or pre-war with craftsmanship and character. I know those buildings tend to be up north, but I’m having a hard time figuring out exactly which areas have the most of them based on listings online.

Public transportation and bikeability are really important to me, too. I only used Divvy while I was there, and since I’m coming from NYC (spoiled by the MTA lol), I’m not totally sure how CTA compares—but I figure I’ll learn.

Diversity is also important to me, and I know that’s more limited in some of the northern neighborhoods. Right now I’m looking between Logan Square and Lakeview East, Pilsen, and some of the closer-to-downtown areas. My budget is $1550–$1600 (including utilities). I’m currently job-hunting, so I’m not sure if I should pick a neighborhood based on work yet, but I don’t mind commuting.

I know this is a long list of criteria and might be a lot to ask for, but if I’m moving halfway across the country, I want it to be as close to perfect as possible!

"Rogers Park Safety around Jonquil/ Sheridan, north of Howard?","There seems to be very mixed opinions on this online, but there are some rather nice condos and apartments in the area listed in the question.

We are new to the area and a lot of people I’ve asked that are locals don’t even know where Rogers Park is which is interesting to me because I️ come from a big city and I️ know every neighborhood. It’s making me understand the loop insulation theory people always talk about on here.

Which neighborhood to visit for our spring break trip?,"Hi! My sister and I are planning a long weekend trip to Chicago and I’m wondering what neighborhoods we should prioritize. Here are our criteria:

\- FOOD. We’re from a rural area without many restaurants and want good, authentic international food. Bonus points if there are good gluten free options (Mexican, Latin, African, Indian restaurants are usually a safe bet for that but we like everything)! Food trucks/carts too! 

\- dancing! We’d like to go dancing at a club that adults go to that isn’t grimy or fratty (we’re 27). 

\- consignment/vintage/thrift shops. We are penny pinchers/dedicated thrifters and want to find actually good stores that don’t charge $40 for a t shirt. Also into cute local shops/art stores! Basically nothing super touristy. 

\- general pleasant vibes/ walkable/ cool buildings and architecture 

\- bonus: a fun cocktail/wine bar to meet people would be great!

What the suburbs have to offer for families that the city does not?,"Family here, four kids ages 1 through 9. Moving to Chicago from FL. We’re debating whether to move to Naperville/Plainfield/Bolingbrook burbs that go to the 204 SD. Decided one day to look for homes closer to the city and found a great option that we really liked in the Jefferson Park neighborhood. House checks all the boxes, of course less backyard and land than what we would get in the burbs, but we literally have everything we would want within 4-10min drive or 10-20min walking distance, and the assigned schools, while not Naperville schools, are rated just fine, kids can walk to it and I know they would love to do that. Our only concern is: crime rate, and I know this is a controversial topic. In our research we have found that this neighborhood is relatively safe, but this based on online databases or maps, nothing from real world experience from people living in the area. We love the idea of having so many parks, libraries, museums, restaurants, Metra, expressways, just around the corner. And having lived in suburbs our entire adult life, we feel this is a great opportunity to move to such a large city as Chicago.

On the other hand, we want what’s best for the kids. Suburbs would offer peace of mind due to how safe they are, potentially more long lasting friendships as most people own rather than rent, and all schools are highly rated. There are also parks, museums and libraries, though you really need a car and everything is at least 15-25 away, the city and airports about 45min or over an hour with regular traffic. So I guess my question is, is there another benefit for families, in addition to safety, of living in the burbs vs city?",AskChicago,36,1705638971.0,133,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/19aanxz/what_the_suburbs_have_to_offer_for_families_that/

For those familiar with Illinois/Chicago around that time of year, what are the usual road conditions like between St. Louis/central Illinois and Chicago in mid-December?

Budget-friendly, dog-friendly stay: I'd love to stay in an Airbnb, but I'm having trouble finding anything affordable ideally $500 or less per night for all of us) that's also dog-friendly and in a decent/safe area with access to public transit. Any specific neighborhoods, hotels, or Airbnb recommendations you'd suggest for a family with a dog? Are there any good discount sites, promo codes, or tricks you've used to get cheaper stays in Chicago around the holidays?

Though we love DC, the cost of living here is a little too high for all of our boxes to be checked and we're considering relocating.

I am seeing a lot of good Chicago-based jobs within my field in the $180K-$220K range (what I make now), and I'm in some talks with a company now. My partners makes \~$110K, but she may have to make a career pivot/ paycut if we move.

His reasoning for wanting to move to Austin, It has a good comedy sence and it would be cheaper and the food. All points I have counted with Chicago has that too. Some of the worlds greatest comedians/writers went to that third city place.  If Austin is the pick, I would have to get a car and he'd have to fix or get a new one.

Moving next month - west loop? Safety as a single female? Beach scene? How’s old town?,"Moving from Manhattan to Chicago next month, and will be out there next week to find a place. 

After tons of research I narrowed down my target neighborhoods to Lakeview East, Lincoln Park, and West Loop. Working downtown, I realized I don’t want to commute 30 (+) mins daily, especially starting a new job and familiarizing myself with the city. (But in general I don’t want to spend so much of my day in the car if I can help it.) So I eliminated Lakeview and Lincoln Park.

I love to go for evening walks which I know is much better by the lake but I saw there are parks in West Loop and going for walks on city streets is fine for me. I was a little concerned West Loop may a little less safe than say east of 90-94. But it seems pretty alright. Do you think it’s pretty much nearly as safe, need not worry? (Yes, yes, be aware of your surroundings, etc.)

How big is the beach scene there? I don’t picture myself going in the water and I’m guessing it’s 3-4 months of the year. I know it’s bit of a trek from west loop. 

Garage waitlists in West Loop can be 30ppl long and the neighboring garage is quite pricey. Assuming it’s still helpful a car though right? Especially in super cold weather to get groceries, etc? 

Lastly, someone just recommended I check out Old Town. The commute isn’t bad and I get the proximity to the lake. Let me know what you think. 

Fyi. Moving on my own (so don’t need to think about kids and schools). Also, love ppl of all ages but would prefer not to be limited to predominately 20 something year old party-ers and a new transplant finding her way. But don’t want a sleepy neighborhood either. 

I’d appreciate any thoughts (or if I missed a beat on something, e.g., traffic): 
• west loop target
• west loop walkability. Trails.
• other neighborhoods, old town? Ideally 20 mins or less to the office 
• safety, safety, safety

"Found severely matted stray dog — need emergency grooming help? (she gets vaccinated Tuesday, I can pay $100)?","Hey everyone,
Last night I found a stray dog in the South Shore neighborhood and brought her in last night until the shelter opened up. I took her to Chicago Animal Care and Control (CACC) on Western, and a woman from PAWS Chicago told me she can get her vaccinated and checked (including an x-ray for her leg) this upcoming Tuesday.

The thing is — this poor girl is in rough shape. She’s severely matted, covered in dried poop, and smells awful. I bathed her five times last night, managed to free up her legs so she can finally poop normally, but the matting is still horrible. She cries when I try to clip her and will bite if I go too far, so I’ve done all I safely can.

I can pay for grooming $100 — that’s not the issue. The issue is that every groomer I’ve called requires proof of rabies vaccination, and since she’s a stray, I obviously don’t have that yet. I just need someone who’s experienced and kind enough to help clean her up asap, even if that means working around her a bit or using a muzzle.

If you’re a groomer, vet tech, rescue volunteer, or know someone who can help, please DM me. I’ll handle payment and transportation. I just want to make her comfortable and safe until her vet appointment.

Thank you so much, Chicago ❤️

Living in the city and commuting to Schaumburg?,"I have a job lined up in Schaumburg, and my gf and I are looking to move to a new place in Chicago close to I-90 in order to make the commute as less terrible as possible. We are really liking the far west side of Lincoln Park, Roscoe Village, and West Lakeview right now. I do not live in Chicago but as I understand it the traffic is usually not very cooperative, and commute times can vary quite a lot. In the mornings it would approximately be 35-50 min, and in the afternoons anywhere between 50-90 min. Are these smart areas to choose when looking for a place, or is it wiser to find a neighborhood further northwest?

I was also considering taking Metra at the Clybourn station. I would bring my e-bike and ride to the office which is only a few miles away and there’s a pretty safe route inbetween my office and the station. I would think it would be less stressful riding on a train for the majority of the commute time, and I can always drive if the weather is bad, but I wanted to gauge opinions on taking the train too as a commute option.

How do I get less anxious living in south Chicago for the first time?,"I just moved to Chicago (south Hyde Park/Woodlawn area) with some college friends, I wanted to be farther up north but they set a firm budget and time limit for apartments and ended up here. The apartment itself is fine, but I'm not really comfortable with the city yet.

This is my first apartment and I've been pretty sheltered so far, living in suburbs with my family or college dorms (and rarely venturing off campus). In theory, I really want to get out and explore new things in the big city, but I'm also very anxious and paranoid especially hearing lots of people talk about crime rates and such.

Especially in the area we're in, I've heard lots of people online say things like 'don't go south of 61st' or '63rd street is dangerous' or etc. I'm also a short, young, autistic woman, so I feel like my street smarts are not the best and feel vulnerable. Plus it feels weird being like one of the very few of white people I've seen in the area because I don't like standing out much.

So far, I've taken the 63rd bus and the red line from there to downtown and back (roommate showed me the route there but I had to go back alone). Walking downtown around Jackson and such was ok enough (Idk I only wandered a couple blocks around where I needed to be), but I felt pretty nervous at the bus stops and on the red line. I also walked to the Jewel on Cottage Grove with roommates once.

Does anyone have any sanity checks for how much I should really be worrying, how safe I am, etc? Any street smart tips or advice for public transport (etiquette, good/bad routes, etc)? Already been obsessively googling stuff lol (including from this sub) which might be making it worse, I don't want to spend all of my time in Chicago holed up in my apartment out of anxiety.

Sorry, I'm sure this sub is probably tired of safety-related questions but I didn't know where else to ask :( And heard that /r/Chicago can be a bit more fear-mongery sometimes from another thread here so wanted a more honest opinion.

Edit: Thanks everyone! I'll try to walk around the neighborhood more and try out the 6/Metra to see how I like those.

How should I evaluate CPS ratings?,"Hello! Husband and I live in Chicago right now and looking for a house to buy in the city. Planning to have kids in the next 1-2 years and would like to future-proof where we live with good schools, specifically elementary schools.

We have found a lot of great places in Uptown, Edgewater, and Andersonville but we don't know what to make of the the public school ratings. The schools that have come up are Goudy, McCutcheon, Hayt, Brennemann, and Courtenay but probably others in those areas too.

EDIT: We have commute restrictions so we need to stay in northern Chicago. We are also looking at houses in the ""well-ranked"" schools radii but we have found houses in our range in the above-mentioned neighborhoods.

My questions:

1. Does anyone have children who attend these schools?
2. How much stock should we put into the GreatSchools or Niche ratings?
3. Say that the rankings are representative, what is the likelihood of actually getting into a ""better-ranked"" CPS school through lottery or whatever and is it safe to bet on that when deciding a house?

* **Kid-friendly neighborhoods**: Which areas have safe, family-oriented communities and activities/events for toddlers (my child is 3)?

* **Job market**: What’s the current outlook for software developers or cybersecurity jobs in Chicago? If you're job hunting, how long has it taken?
* **Housing**: I’m aiming for a 2-bedroom under $1600/month — is that realistic? What’s the usual rental process (e.g. income requirements, deposits)?

Airbnbs in Chicago,"I’m getting close to wit’s end on this.
I moved to Chicago (Ukrainian Village to be exact) into an apartment building with commercial properties on the first floor. I didn’t realize that the building next to us which is a mirrored version of my building was used for Airbnbs.

Every other weekend there are guests that stay in those apartments, but regularly stay up late, well past midnight in some instances. Our walls are pretty thin, so we can hear everything.

Last Monday, folks were hanging out in the alley between our buildings smoking and talking and laughing at 11:30 at night until 1am. I asked them to keep it down and they apologized, but continued on. I had to turn on white noise and use ear plugs to fall asleep.

I’ve contacted our property manager and they connected me to the company that manages their Airbnbs. They sent me $50 for my trouble and I’ve tried to deal with it and ignore.

Again, last night at 2am, an argument broke out amongst the guests after they had gone out for one of the guests birthdays (yes, I could hear everything!!!) I had to go out several times between 2 and 3am to ask them to quiet down. I also emailed the Airbnb manager with videos. I ultimately decided to stop going out since it almost felt like I was escalating and worried it could go violent at some points. Two cars were speeding in and out of the alley with people yelling out the windows.

My questions are: 
- is there anything I can do further with the property manager or Airbnb company? Can I file a formal complaint? I know Chicago has been great for tenants’ rights, but is there anything specific towards short term rentals I should look out for?
- obviously will be more thorough in vetting places I live, but can I ask apartments about Airbnbs in the building? Not sure if I’m even allowed to ask for that info.
- what can I do outside of calling the police for what’s ultimately a noise complaint to try and tamper these instances from happening? I prefer not to call police especially with their known history of being less than useful.

We’ve also had some issues of packages being opening/stolen, a car break-in, nd a break-in on the first floor while my neighbor was at home. I’m really saddened by this as the neighborhood itself seemed really family oriented and safe. I understand crime can happen anywhere and I’m lucky that these are relatively minor offenses.

FWIW, I’ve lived in Dorchester in Boston and Miami so it’s not that I’m not used to areas that are less than savory.

Moving to Chicago! What neighborhood would suit me?,"Unfortunately, my mom has a disabling condition that is likely to progress so I’m moving to Chicago to be closer to her so I can help out more. I currently live in Philly where I’ve spent most of my adult life, and we’re looking for some recommendations on neighborhoods/ gyms/ workplaces. 

We would love a neighborhood that is walkable, safe, and near public transit. I work as an ER doctor and often get off work super late (like midnight) so being in a neighborhood where I feel safe late at night is really helpful. I also hate driving so the more walkable the better. 

I love fancy gyms and would love to find one close by. My current gym has unlimited classes which really motivates me to actually go and work out, so anywhere that has a similar gym nearby would be a plus. I also rock climb so proximity to a climbing gym would also be great. 

I’m not big on bars/ partying but would love to be somewhere with a decent restaurant scene. 

This is super specific but if any Chicago Emergency Medicine people have thoughts on working for specific local hospitals/ health systems I would love to hear them. I work in academic EM and have virtually no connections in Chicago as I’ve done all my training in Philly.

Edited to Add: thanks for everyone’s input. I don’t yet have a job in Chicago, the move would be in the summer so I’m applying now.

I’ll be in Chicago for a week for work, staying near W North Ave &amp; N Milwaukee Ave. I’ll be at Fabtech during the day, but I’ll be free after 5pm.

Last time I was in the city, I ended up at the Laugh Factory every evening. It was fun, but this time I’d like to mix it up and try new things.

My hobbies include cycling (are there spots to rent a road bike near the lakefront?), paddle boarding, yoga, gym, comedy shows, acai bowls, and checking out good steakhouses.

Any solid breakfast spot with healthy options before heading to the event nearby?
And in the neighborhood I’m staying at walkable and somewhat safe?

How come have there been so many stores/restaurants closed in West Town/Noble Square?,"I’ve been looking to open my own retail business and came across many spaces available to rent/buy in (east side of) West Town, my agent says it’s a developing neighborhood, but I’m curious why there have been so many stores/restaurants covered up or closed recently - for quite a few there even they are open, they only open like 4 days a week with very short hours (like less than 6 hours a day). When I looked up their Google Reviews, many recent reviews have been posted, which kinda encourages but still makes me hesitate. 



I’m not very familiar with the neighborhood… originally I was looking for opportunities in Lakeview/Lincoln Park… 



I field tripped there a few times (Noble Square, between Chicago and Grand/north to Fulton Market in particular). I do like the neighborhood, it seems diverse, quiet and safe - I always saw people walking their dogs or running, but just the businesses there don’t look to me blooming.



I researched a bit and some restaurants are just moving to the suburbs, some are only ""temporarily closed"" according to Google Map, not necessarily completely out of business, and most information online still suggests West Town is worth moving into/investing - any insights? Is it just a coincidence that many restaurants have been moving away or closed in the winter - is it just this time of the year… or the West Town is up and coming thing is not entirely true, or that just doesn’t apply to certain parts of the community?

8/15:

Arrive in Chicago around 2PM. Maybe have dinner at John Hancock tower after check in at the hotel (downtown area) and settling in.

8/16:

Breakfast (was recced Yolk South Loop) and then Field Museum from about 10 AM - 2 PM. Have Lunch somewhere around the museum. Visit Lincoln Park. And maybe go to the Cubs game at 7 PM.

8/17:

Breakfast (undecided) then Millenium Park in the morning. Was recced Oasis cafe for lunch. Do the magnificent mile + riverwalk. And I booked the Architecture River Cruise at 7:30 PM.

8/18:

Having breakfast with a friend (undecided where) and then going to the airport.

Alright, now for the mini rant. I'm currently living in LA. I'm very excited for this trip because Chicago is a city that I've been considering moving to in a couple of years, after I finish my degree here and am able to apply for better jobs. Soooo many LA people keep fearmongering me about the dangers of Chicago and how violent it is. Some are even trying to talk me out of the trip. 

I understand that, but from what I've seen I'm not going to visit any particularly dangerous part of Chicago. Also... I'm from Brazil lol. I've spent half of my life living in Rio, a city where there's no real such thing as a ""safe"" neighborhood. I lived in a neighborhood that had FOUR favelas. I know how to operate in dangerous places. I know to not use my phone in public, be aware of my surroundings, trust my gut, not wear jewelry, stay in crowded areas, wear any bags across the chest etc. Also, LA has plenty of unsafe areas too. I've never had a problem navigating them. When I mentioned my trip to my manager she just gave me a side-eye and said ""be careful."" Another girl keeps telling me I'm gonna get murdered every time I mention my trip. I'd be lying if I said it didn't bum me out because I'm excited but there's few people to share the excitement with.

Also, last thing. I love thrift shopping so if anyone has any thrift shop recommendations around the downtown area lemme know. Thanks!

How safe is SW Humboldt Park to live?,"Hey all, I know Humboldt area is highly discussed around here and I’m still brand new to Chicago.

I work in Lincoln Park and want to be close to music venues for freelance work and networking. atp Lincoln Park and Palmer Square areas + just east of that seem to be my best bet for the combination of an easy commute and good location.

However, I came across a perfect unit by Humboldt that’s 2bd and willing to lower rent to $1500 for me as a solo renter.

"Questions about Relocating to Chicago, IL?","Hello, I would like to move to Chicago as soon as possible for personal reasons. I have many questions about how to go about it, and it would be great if anyone had any insight!

Career: I completed my bachelor's degree in 2024 (in California, also grew up in CA and never visited Chicago yet) and have been working as a medical scribe since then. I would like to expand my career and do something more hands on. My options for jobs are to request a relocation to Chicago (though the pay is much less for the position there), work there and eventually apply to different jobs in the area once I'm there. My other option is to apply to jobs now and relocate once I receive an offer, though I am uncertain how much time that would take. I was wondering if anyone has been in a similar dilemma, what worked for them, and if they put an address/skipped adding an address/only put ""planning to relocate,"" etc. on their resume assuming they applied for jobs before moving. How many jobs have people applied to and how long did it take? I am looking at medical assistant/patient care tech, etc. jobs, though I am uncertified as of now.

Neighborhood: I grew up in the suburbs, and would like to live in a residential apartment building (either a studio by myself or with female roommates in a larger apartment) in an area surrounded by people my age (early 20s) and work my way up to living in the city. I would like to be in an area that is generally safe, and am leaning more towards the North side of the Chicago city. I also love night life and would like to be able to go out often. Let me know which neighborhoods and buildings people recommend! Also, which websites to people use in Chicago to find roommates, and what is the process of using the free realtors in the area?

Which area of the city should I move to (outdoorsy 36yo female)?,"Hi there! I'm moving from Boulder, Colorado to Chicago in May for work. I'm honestly really sad about it. I need the job, but I love it here in Boulder. It's pricey and not the most culturally diverse, but it's highly walkable/bike-able, super safe, there's endless hiking trails, lots of sunshine, and I can afford to rent a small house (with one roommate) so I have a little gardening space, which is important to me.

I guess I just don't feel like much of a ""city girl,"" (originally from small town Ohio) so I'm having a hard time figuring out which areas of the city I'd fit in the best. I'd love some input for where to begin my search for housing. Here's what matters most to me:

* Safety – I'm a single 36yo female with a cat
* Nature &amp; trees – I love hiking, running, backpacking, biking around town, playing in creeks and rivers, kayaking, etc. I feel anxious just thinking about being surrounded by high-rise buildings.
* Cost – I'll be making about $93k annually; would like rent to be $1,500-ish/month (or less)
* Culture/vibe – Again, I don't feel like a ""city girl."" Looking for neighborhoods with small-town community vibes where there's stuff to do but I can have peace and quiet at home.
* Commute – I'll need to get to my job in the Bucktown area 4 days/week
* House (vs apartment) – Probably not reasonable given my price range, but I love the idea of renting a very small house with a small backyard space for container gardening. And so I don't have to worry as much about apartment-living stuff like bedbugs, roaches, noise, etc.

Other stuff that might be helpful to know:

* I've kind of given up on dating but I am hoping to make new friends (people in their late 20s–mid-40s?)
* I have an SUV so will need parking (I more than welcome any tips for weekend excursions around nature, backpacking, camping, etc.!)
* I play the fiddle and really like bluegrass &amp; country - live music, going to picks, jams, open stages, etc.

"Long weekend in Chicago — hotels ($200–$400), steak, burrata, 420-friendly food ideas, rooftop lounge &amp; LGBTQ+ nightlife recs?","Hi Chicago!

My friend (driving in) and I (flying in) are planning a long weekend in early November. We’ll have a car, but want to spend most of our time in the city. Looking for recommendations on hotels, food, activities, and nightlife.

Hotels
• Budget: **$200–$400/night**
• Prefer near the **Riverwalk, Michigan Avenue, or Navy Pier**
• Considering the **O’Hare area + Blue Line in**, but not sure if that’s worth it for a short trip
• **Must be LGBTQ+ friendly**

Restaurants
• **Steak** (surf &amp; turf a plus)
• **420-friendly food experiences** (if anyone has recommendations that are compliant/legal in Chicago)
• **Italian** (burrata is a necessity)

Activities
• Want to do a **lounge/view in a tall building** (like Hancock or Willis)
• **Semi-touristy is fine**, but local finds are even better
• Considering things like:
	•	Architecture boat tour / Riverwalk stroll
	•	Museums or smaller galleries
	•	Hands-on classes (jewelry, metalworking, cooking)
	•	Bowling alleys or similar casual fun

After-Dinner / Nightlife
• **LGBTQ+ friendly clubs/bars** (any neighborhood recs welcome)
• Open to chill bars, lounges, or more lively clubs
• Also open to non-bar activities (bowling, late-night classes, etc.)

Specific asks:
• Hotel recs in our budget that are walkable/safe
• **Best steak + surf &amp; turf spots** locals prefer
• Italian restaurants with amazing **burrata**
• Rooftop or lounge with great views (bonus if it’s not too touristy)
• LGBTQ+ nightlife that feels welcoming

Questions about potential move to Chicago?,"Hello! I am applying to graduate schools and my top choice is UoC! We have a few questions as we go through this process and consider a few other cities. Others in consideration are in Connecticut, Boston, Fort Worth (bleh), and New Jersey. If you have any advice for who Chicago is better than those places, lemme know because it is already top of our list, lol. 

First, we are moving from a very mid-sized Midwest city that is not walkable, does not have any public transit,  but has a great cost of living. A major pro for Chicago is that it has direct flights to our Midwest city, making it a great option for visiting family and friends. We have never lived in such a large place and my partner is specifically worried about moving somewhere so large due to the cost of living, moving as a same sex couple, and the volume of people. Based on online research (on askchicago lmao) it seems that it is suuuuper queer friendly, but for the other aspect of needing to use transit, is it easy to learn and navigate? Is it overwhelming at first but gets easier? Or stays overwhelming? lol.

Second, I am a teacher but will not be teaching in grad school, and she is in engineering making ~95k in our mid sized city, so we will just be on her income. If she keeps a salary at this level, is this doable for two adults and a dog in Chicago? Based on some posts from a year ago that I read, it seems doable, but I know our state’s cost of living is rapidly increasing and I’m curious if this would impact Chicago, too. Can we live in a walkable and desirable neighborhood with this salary? 

We are specifically looking for somewhere walkable, safe, and lgbtq+ inclusive. Any neighborhoods we should be on the hunt for?

Advice after Aug. robbery in Bucktown? To move or not to move...,"Hello! I'm coming to this sub for a bit of expert advice. I've been living in Chicago for a little over a year - first in Ukrainian Village (approx. Western + Iowa) for a year and moved to Bucktown in mid-July for a better commute and more safety. I'm from the East Coast and lived near Boston, MA for \~10 years before moving here for work. I've always tried to use street smarts and be vigilant but unfortunately, while my dad was visiting me from out of town, we experienced an armed robbery near my apartment in August. They took my wallet and I was unharmed but my dad was hit with the gun and beat up. It was terrifying. The police are involved but it's unlikely they'll find the perpetrators because there was little evidence left behind and we can't remember their faces plus there's no camera footage.

I've had a hard time getting back to normal life since then, especially because the crime surge has continued. I have a good support network but I don't feel safe going anywhere and I have intense anxiety about anyone visiting me. I'm on the edge of packing up and quitting Chicago. Before this, I was building a little life here. I sang in a chorus, went to art groups/events, hung out with friends, and went to networking things, explored the city, etc. but now none of that feels safe.

Right now I work in Fulton Market and commute to the office three times a week. My budget for rent  is \~$1600-1650 max for a one bedroom w/ office. I'm 29, female, and live alone.

How to feel safe in elevated first floor unit?,"My husband and I are looking to buy a condo in Uptown or Rogers Park, and we've seen some elevated first floor units that we're really interested in (we rent in Uptown now). I have always lived in second or third floor apartments, and I'm wrestling with the pros and cons of moving to the first floor - primarily related to safety.

I like to keep the windows open as much as possible, including at night in the summer (best way to cool things down while keeping AC usage to a minimum).

Cutting down on the number of stairs would also be nice, as would not having to worry as much about our own noise levels because there wouldn't be neighbors below us in some of the buildings we've looked at.

Obviously, being closer to the ground with an open window heightens the chance of a break-in, and I also know that break-ins can happen to any building/floor. All that said - how big of a concern do you all think open elevated first-floor windows actually are? Are there break-in deterrents that would allow us to keep windows open a couple of inches in the bedroom at night to let in a cool breeze? I don't think I'm overly paranoid about safety stuff, but I do want to feel reasonably secure in my home, especially if I own it. And I want to be able to open a window.",AskChicago,2,1738389211.0,27,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1iezsrw/how_to_feel_safe_in_elevated_first_floor_unit/

What are the best budget-friendly short-term rentals in downtown Chicago for a family of six in July?,"Hi everyone,

I’m from Huntley and planning a trip to downtown Chicago this July. We’re looking for budget-friendly rental options for a stay of 1 to 2 weeks. We’re a family of six, including a toddler, so we’re hoping to find a place that’s spacious, family-friendly, and ideally available through services like Airbnb or similar platforms that offer child-friendly amenities.

If you’ve stayed in or know of any affordable and convenient short-term rentals in the downtown area, I’d be so grateful for your tips. Also open to suggestions on safe, walkable neighborhoods with access to transit or parks.

Thanks so much in advance for any recommendations!

What’s a Good/Your Recommended Neighborhood for Me?,"Hi there! I’m very excited to be moving to Chicago in a month. That’s right, I’ve got just about 4 weeks to pack up and find a new place in your wonderful city! 
I’ve lived in Illinois before (I was raised in Boston and small town/rural Illinois.) I went to undergrad at U of I in Champaign but have never actually lived in Chicago. 

I’m working a hybrid job and my building is on East Wacker. I’m struggling to decide which neighborhood to live in. 
I tend towards studios or 1 bedrooms (at least 500 square ft), and love high rises. I also like character. I don’t need a big kitchen and I’m planning to get a dog! 

I don’t plan to have a car for the first few months, love walking and using public transport. I like local restaurants and places to shop at, and just generally something that feels like a neighborhood. 

I’ll be living alone so safety is important. My friends who have lived there before all have different opinions—some say lakeview, some say lakeshore, I say what about Lincoln Park. Hah! I’ve also been told Michigan Ave and State St aren’t safe anymore so maybe stay away from West Loop/River North…but have also been told the opposite. 

My budget is 1800-2500 a month. Oh, and i love book clubs if anyone has one to recommend!

Quick trip to Chicago - where to stay at an Airbnb?,"Hi all! I'm sure this question gets asked a lot so I apologize, planning a trip to Chicago in September for 3-4 people, and wanted to ask for recommendations on where to stay?

We're all in our mid-20's and love checking out food spots, street fairs/markets/festivals, and definitely would love to hit up some of the (maybe basic) tourist spots/activities - downtown, Navy Pier, the MCA, boat tours/riverwalk, Milennium Park, etc.

It's only a two night trip so we can't check everything the city has to offer; but in terms of places to stay, we just want to be safe and comfortable. We're totally fine with venturing outside of the neighborhood to check out food spots/bars, etc, and relying on the CTA trains to get out, but also would like to be in areas where it's safe to walk (especially if we're out at night after a bar).

I've seen/heard a few options on this sub and others on where to stay: River North, Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Wicker Park, West Loop, and Fulton Market - basically places north and west of downtown/loop area. For a two night trip where most of what we'd be doing would be in and around downtown and the lakefront area, are these spots good? Too far? Too close? Too basic?

Is late-night commuting from UIC a bad idea?,"Yes, this is a question involving where to live and safety. I apologize in advance.

I'm interviewing for a job at UIC that would involve regularly working until around 11 PM. I don't have a drivers' license, so I get around via public transportation or on foot. As a lifelong public transit rider I know how to catch a vibe and am used to minding my own business/belongings, but I'm also aware that there are some places that are generally safe but aren't late at night and when it comes to Chicago, I don't know what I don't know.

My questions are, is regularly commuting on the Blue or Pink Line (or the bus?) from UIC at 11 PM actually a bad idea, and are there any neighborhoods I should actively avoid living in with this commute?

However, as an old househead (Farina, Derrick Carter, Sunshine Jones, Onionz, Doc, Migs, Levan etc) ARC seems like a great time. I want to explore Chicago, however, and do not want to get sucked into being at a festival and making that the center of the trip.

Chicago with a reactive dog - is it possible?,"Hello!

I have long considered moving to the area. I recently quit my job so it’s looking like relocation is in my near future. As I’m considering options, I need some advice about life with my reactive Australian Cattle Dog as I’m pretty skeptical about Chicago being a good fit. 

My dog is a rescue, he came to the shelter as a stray so nothing is known about his past life except that he already had a back leg amputated. He was very unhappy at the shelter and exhibited a lot of barrier aggression and some resource guarding which we pretty much worked through for the most part. However, it was very clear immediately that he likely lost his leg in a car accident because he wants to run head first at them! He’s come a long way, but still has slip ups and does get stressed in very busy areas. 

Another issues is his fear of strangers and other dogs, very close passing is not doable. Especially with other dogs. We do walk around occasionally in busy areas like parks with a muzzle and he does okay. And honestly when people see the muzzle they usually give us space :) 

Given our situation, I’d prefer to live further away. I we stayed a few days in Berwyn and were able to manage fine on walks and even went to the park (but it was soooo cold so that likely made it much quieter than usual) BUT my partner wants to live in the city. 

He says we can find a place that meets our needs, but I have walked a friends dog in Pilsen and West Town and we constantly pass dogs and people in close proximity. I am also the person who does most of the walking and all of the training … so I am a lot more nervous about being to give our guy a good quality of life and keep everyone happy and safe. I would just hate to make his reactivity worse with repeated exposure that’s over his threshold. 

Minimally we would need just a block or two that is quiet. At the very least I need to be able to quickly cross the street or pull off the sidewalk to make space for people to pass. Ideally, we’d have a small yard where he can play with his herding ball. He has a lot of energy, but is just fine with a few daily slow pace walks and tons of indoor enrichment and playing though. I’m sure a yard is a pipe dream lol. 

So… does such a place exist anywhere in Chicago? Any recommendations on which neighborhoods to check out next time we come through? If anyone specifically has experience with reactive dogs in a city I would much appreciate your input. TIA!!!!

Ideally we’d like to be in a new place by the first week of September. 1bed/1bath with lots of space for our things (ideally 2bed/1bath). Our budget is $1300 with utilities/amenities included.

Single mom in crisis in Lake County can anyone help or give advice please?,"** How can I get out of my lease? My credit cards are almost maxed out, but how can I use it for essentials &amp; emergency shelter &amp; to get back on my feet, so I don't have to stay in this environment? I don't have my license, but my friend is giving me lessons so I can change that, but if anyone has any recommendations on sleeping in a car/van please let me know! **


Backstory: Ever since I can remember, my parents have been stuck in a vicious cycle of toxicity. My dad hooked on drugs/alcohol typically running the streets, or in prison, being physically abusive to my mother &amp; my grandfather when he would step in, and my mother being emotionally dependent continually taking him back dispite everything that's occurred.

My only solace was my grandparents, and any pets we'd have, however, even my pets have ran away, or like my grandparents, passed a couple years ago very tragically.

I've struggled with a difficult home life as well as overcoming selective mutism, being bullied in school from teachers &amp; students, grooming &amp; sexual abuse either from strangers in the neighborhood or online, and the police have done nothing when notified. One of those predators, impregnated me at 15 with my son who's just turned 9 this year. . So basically mental health had me in a constant chokehold &amp; I still have little to no friends/family to help. Either the family I have left is abusive, neglectful, racist (mom's side depises mixed race), or ignoring how bad things are and pretending everything is fine.

Now: In an apt in Lake County with my mother, my oldest sister, and her bf on the lease. We're behind rent since Feb. Our power got cut off today until we pay an outstanding balance in my name of over $900. I've tried to make an apt with LIHEAP but other members of the household don't care &amp; won't give be their required info, so here we are.

Household consists of my Myself, my son, our 4 ESA rats, my oldest sister (V), her bf (C), their one year old (K), and their pregnant with their 2nd due is OCT '25. My youngest sister (D) and my parents.

Oldest sister &amp; her bf: History of being chronically unemployed or only my sister working &amp; providing for them. They've been offered as much as help &amp; free stays as they can get, but there's not enough effort being made.

Youngest sister (D): is has a history of arrests/DUIs overdoses etc who's on a better path now, but it's hard for her to get a place on her own, so she stays here with her ESA dog (mostly her dog). She has anger issues she's working on, but has taken her anger out on my oldest sister with resulted in a police report, and occasionally being emotionally abusive to myself &amp; my son at times.

Father: Mostly sober, relies on marijuana &amp; cigarettes, but slips back into old habits of drugs/alchol, as well as physical, verbal abuse against myself, my son, and my mom.

Mom: Stuck in absuive cycle &amp; expects me to stay quiet &amp; supportive of her disrespecting our boundaries of not letting my abusive father stay in our home.

My son: The only reason I'm still alive. He struggles with ADHD &amp; depression which is triggered by our hostile environment &amp; loneliness. He's been hospitals for trying to hurt himself when he was 6, and was sexually assaulted by an older roommate, which I have an ongoing lawsuit with. I homeschool him due to bullying &amp; now kids at our Apt are bullying him here, too. I made a police report because they physically assaulted him, but the police didn't do a thing. He cries to me about wanting a safe place with friends &amp; I feel like absolute shit because I feel like I'm failing him.

Myself: I lost my previous restaurant job to Covid &amp; then to spontaneous hand injury that is 50% hearted after my surgery 2 years ago. Since the , I've struggled to find consistent &amp; FT work, so I'm currently an online sex worker &amp; get paid through YWCA to watch my nephew to get by.

Highlights: Seeing my mother being hurt constantly, seeing my dad beating my grandpa bloodied with teeth missing, not knowing if we'd have a place to stay, food to eat, power at home, or having nightmares of my dad killing my family members.

SUMMARY: Coming from a dysfunctional family of DV &amp; neglect, years of sexual grooming &amp; abuse. Now with little to no support system, homeschooong my child on Lexapro for ADHD &amp; Depression dealing with bullying at our apt, four ESA rats, having to do online sex work to survive and feeling like we have nowhere to go. . .

Any and all help &amp; advice is appreciated. I feel like I'm at my whits end. I struggle with suicidal thoughts, but even my medication isn't helping with all this going on, but I'm trying to stay strong for my son. We're all we have right now.

What is life like raising children in Lincoln Park?,"My wife and I are considering living in Lincoln Park with young children because it's close to work and also relatively safe neighborhood. Usually I read people giving pretty one-sided defenses of raising kids in the city, but what are some of the down-sides vs the suburbs? It would be nice to have the reality / nuanced view. 2 questions :

  
What is the sense of family community in LP compared to suburbs or even places like North Center or Lincoln Square? Last weekend we drove around and honestly didn't see too many families walking around. Is that normal? It felt like a place for adults mostly, but I've heard there is a family community there as well.   


Is Lincoln Elementary honestly quality? I read it's ranked high, but then the test scores for proficiency are actually not that impressive compared to some suburban schools. Have you found this school is a place that offers your child a quality learning experience and are their classmates all good influences and not overly aggressive, distracting, or otherwise troublesome?  


As you may guess, we're expecting and trying to plan out our move (Lincoln Park vs Suburbs) and have concluded LP is really the only place we'd feel comfortable sending our kids to public elementary school. Private is not really in budget unfortunately, unless you have recommendations for relatively affordable options (not 40k per year).   


Part of me thinks we're just overthinking the obvious move to the suburbs to make life easier, safer and higher quality education for children, but any thoughts from parents who have made this work would be appreciated! My wife and I love the city and do want to find reasons to stay.  ",AskChicago,5,1707568850.0,40,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1anfguz/what_is_life_like_raising_children_in_lincoln_park/
Possibly Moving to Chicago — Recommend Neighborhoods?,"Hi everyone,

As the title suggests, I’m looking at moving to Chicago (sometime this winter).  It would be me (20s male), my wife (20s), and our small dog.  I’m currently interviewing for a job out in the suburbs (Naperville) and am waiting on a decision for a job in the Loop.  These would both be hybrid positions (at least 3 days per week in office).  Household income grosses $90-100k.  

I’ve looked  at apartments and townhomes online and have been a bit overwhelmed to be honest.  We’d like to keep rent at or below $1800/month but we can go as high as $2000/month.  We’re not too concerned with the higher rent costs because we would get rid of one of our cars and pay off the other which would decrease our monthly transportation expenses by around $650 ($500/month after adjusting for CTA costs).  We’re coming from an area where you need a car to live essentially.  

What are some of your favorite north side neighborhoods that are affordable, walkable, and safe?  Family-friendly is also a plus (we’re planning on starting to try to have kids in the next 2-3 years).  Why are they your favorite neighborhoods?  Pros/cons?  Political/social leanings of neighborhoods?

Also, we’re traveling to Chicago next week to spend a week in the city and get a feel so we’ll be able to visit any areas you mention/recommend.

Neighborhood Safety,"I live in Chicago, bordering Norridge. Every day, I walk my dog on Lawrence Ave.

When I told her she needed to bring her vehicle to a stop *before* the crosswalk, she simply told me that her husband “is a cop” and she can do “whatever the fuck” she wants.

Is North Chicago Safe As A Home Base For A Birthday Celebration?,"(Modified: To clarify we will be staying in the Rogers Park neighborhood)  
Hi friends,We've been to Chicago many times and love it. Usually we drive through Schaumburg, eat at Penang (I am of Malaysian heritage) and continue onto Wisconsin where my daughter goes to school. We also love Downtown Chicago and have stayed in hotels off the Miracle Mile and went in on the whole tourist experience.

Because we and our daughter love the city so much, we decided to celebrate her 21st in Chicago this Spring. Since we're bringing 6 of her friends from semi-rural/suburbian Wisconsin we decided to get an airbnb in North Chicago. Off Clark St (The Harmony House?) not far from the Chicago Public Library. We plan to take the train from the Morse St station into the city.

We're not as familiar with that part of town and I am wondering if anyone has any thoughts on whether that location is advisable for two adults and perhaps not as street smart 6 young adult women to use as a home base for our festivities.

Questions about which neighborhoods to consider in moving to in Chicago.,"Hello,

I first off want to apologize for how basic and common this post is, but I feel like my priorities are unique enough to warrant a post. I'm planning on moving to Chicago in September, and I'd figure I'd ask for input on which specific neighborhoods to look at when I visit to find housing:

What im looking for (im no particular order):
1.) Reasonably safe. I'm moving from a bad part of New Orleans where ive been for nine years, and am originally from Cleveland, so I'm well aware that cities are not vanilla suburbs, nor do i have the expectation of 100% safety. I work nights, so I guess I want to feel OK walking my dog at 1am. I'm not scared of the unhoused or addicts, but ideally just not an area of high violent crime.

2.) Ease of getting around the city via public transportation and car. I work in hospitality, and most likely will end up working in the loop, where I will most likely not live, so ease of getting around is important.

3.) Cool shops/restaurants/stuff. I'm 40 and in recovery, so nightlife/partying isn't what I'm looking for, but I love theatre/movies/live shows/eating out/ethnic cuisine/etc. 

4.) Affordability. I'm looking to spend $1200-$1550 on rent, for a 1 bedroom. I have a 40lb non-dangerous breed dog as well. I don't need a lot of space, but I do have a car, and would rather not have to spend hundreds on parking. 

Thank you for all of your help, I know this is an annoying question you must all get bombarded with regularly. So far I've been looking at Portage Park near the Blue Line L station, but would love to expand my search.",AskChicago,21,1683749311.0,47,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/13e1pj6/questions_about_which_neighborhoods_to_consider/

How is living in the Loop vs River North?,"For some background, I (27M) am looking to move to Chicago from Des Moines next spring. I'm planning on talking to a leasing agent closer to my move-in date, but I'm doing some preliminary research. I work remotely, so commute isn't a factor for me. I've been to the city a couple of times, once in the Lakeview/Lincoln Park area and once around the Loop for Lollapalooza. I see Lakeview recommended often for newcomers to the city, and it's a strong contender for me (as is West Loop), but I'm really looking to compare highrise neighborhoods so I can narrow things down and decide more based on what sort of experience I want. I view Lakeview as a really good safe option, but all the highrises make my monkey brain happy, so I at least want to consider it. More practically, I think the Loop could also be a great home base because all the transit converges there. With that, I could explore other neighborhoods really easily while helping to minimize the number of transfers I have to do, which would help mitigate the recent issues I've heard about the CTA.

I'm sure this question has been asked, but the reason I'm asking now is just to see if things have changed post-COVID with so many people going to remote or hybrid work. Is the Loop still pretty much purely a business district? Would I be better off just sticking with River North if I'm looking for the highrise sort of experience? The main reason I'm moving is because I'm looking for walkability and a good social scene where I can meet people more naturally and frequently see the same people. To be totally transparent, I'd really like to have an easier time meeting single women too. I don't particularly care about bars, but cool cafes and a good hobby scene (e.g. cooking classes, running/walking/cycling clubs, coffee roasting and latte art classes, etc.) would be really nice. In some ways, the thought of it being quiet at night is actually sort of appealing since I could have a quiet place to retreat to at the end of the day, but if it's just socially barren, there's no point.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Is the Loop still dead at night post-COVID? Or has it changed to have any more of a neighborhood feel since so many people went remote for a while? Is it a reasonable alternative to River North for someone looking for a good social scene?",AskChicago,19,1698895505.0,37,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/17lugrc/how_is_living_in_the_loop_vs_river_north/

"Planning to Move to Chicago in October – Job Advice, Hospital Recommendations, and Where to Live?","Hi everyone!

I’m a registered nurse currently working in Florida, and I’m planning to move to Chicago in October 2025. By the time I relocate, I’ll have one year of experience working on a Cardiac Step-Down Unit.

I’d love to secure a job before the move, ideally starting in November, and I’m trying to figure out when would be the best time to start applying. Most of the jobs I’m seeing now are for immediate hire, so I’m unsure how early is too early to apply for something that far in advance.

My interests:
	•	I’m really drawn to outpatient roles, especially diagnostic radiology, but I haven’t seen many listings in that area.
	•	I’m also open to OR or PACU, but I’ve noticed that most of those roles require either prior OR experience or ICU/ER background. At this point, I’m not sure if I want to go through ICU or ER just to get my foot in the door for those specialties.

My goal is to get out of bedside nursing and transition away from night shift. I’m very open to other non-hospital roles or specialties that offer better work-life balance. If you know of any good options in the Chicago area for nurses with one year of experience looking to pivot away from traditional bedside roles, I’m all ears!

Bonus points if you can share:
	•	Average RN pay in Chicago for someone with 1 year of experience
	•	Best hospitals or outpatient centers to work for in terms of culture, support, or opportunities to grow
	•	Good/safe neighborhoods to consider moving to as a young professional nurse

Humboldt Park East and South Safe?,"Hi everyone,

I am looking into some apartments to live in and found some near Humboldt Park that are cute and affordable. Looking at a map, on the East side of the park and the range is form W Chicago Avenue to W Le Moyne St.  
I am looking into the Ukrainian village area too! However, my hopes are low because places are either too high in price or they get taken really fast. 🥲

Like most active places, I am proactive in being aware of my surroundings, where are easy exits, I have a taser on my key chain, and don't be dumb such as walking around late at night drunk... or be out at night alone!

Moving to Chicago this summer - where should I live?,"Hi all! I recently found out I will be moving to Chicago in June! I am excited, but nervous as I have never been there before. With my current schedule, I’m not sure when or if I will have time to visit and look for an apartment, so I am hoping to do a lot of the searching online.

About me:
- I’m 30, male, single, and gay
- I’ve lived in Florida my whole life (but I am FINALLY getting out!)
- I’ve never lived in a big city (only in the suburbs of one)
- I will be working in the southernmost part of Near South Side (near Chinatown)

I’m looking to find an apartment in an area that will be welcoming, fun, safe, and not overwhelming. It would be great to live near where there’s a thriving LGBT community, but idk if Boystown (Northalsted) is too far for my commute. I will have my car, but if I can use public transportation that would be great. Oh, and budget is around 2k

Initially I was looking in South Loop, but now I’m wondering if I should look north of the river for an area with more culture and where I can more easily meet people. If I do look further north and decide to drive, how is traffic typically for a north-to-south commute down Lakeshore? Doesn’t seem bad based on Google Maps but that could be deceiving. 

Any suggestions for apartments, neighborhoods, or advice on moving to Chicago in general would be much appreciated!

Is Roseland/109th and South Wabash a dangerous area?,"Hey guys, so I'm from out of State, but I love Chicago, it's my favorite city in the world. I'm going to be visiting again in a few months with some friends and I've always wondered about this specific area. My  great-great grandparents owned a house here in the 1890s/early 1900s (between 109th and 110th on South Wabash, in the Roseland community area) and I've thought before about driving past the house just to see it. I'm not planning on loitering or knocking on the door or taking pictures or anything like that, just a quick drive past to see the current exterior. 

Now I know Roseland and the surrounding streets are not necessarily the safest in the city. WikiTravel says to avoid the so-called ""Wild 100s"" and my grandfather once asked a friend in Chicago who was a police officer about the area, and he said he wouldn't go down there without backup. Yet Roseland (at least on the crime maps of the community areas) isn't one of the absolute worst in the city, right?

I'm just wondering if this is a super bad area and a place to stay away from at all costs, or is it probably just fine to drive through and not loiter around? I'm of course not from Chicago, so who better to ask then actual Chicagoans? 

I appreciate any responses and if I inadvertently offended anyone, I apologize! ",AskChicago,1,1713324874.0,21,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1c5zwb9/is_roseland109th_and_south_wabash_a_dangerous_area/
Why don't people in this city care about police reform?,"I lived a block away from a police station on the north side for 25 years so I had multiple issues with police officers just because I happen to live in such close proximity to the police station and be outdoors.

A sampling in no particular order:

1) I was riding my bicycle at night and out of nowhere a speeding police car with its lights off intentionally sped into me to knock me off the road, throwing my body hard onto the cement curve.  The officer shone a flood light into my eyes, said they thought I was someone else, and sped away.  

2) I took the lakefront bike path to my bank job downtown for over two decades whenever it was warm enough outside.  One night on the way home the path was blocked by a police officer who told me to turn around.  When I asked what was going on the officer pulled his gun out of its holster and aimed it at my head.  He was fat and in his 50's and his face was bright red like a cartoon character with steam coming out of his ears which would have been funny if this crazy fuck wasn't pointing a loaded gun at my head.  His partner appeared out of nowhere, put his hands on his partner's gun hand, moved it to the side, apologized, and told me to just leave. Right now.

3) In the early 00's my stepfather had moved to Rogers Park a few miles away from me without my knowledge (we were not close) and was found dead in his apartment from smoke inhalation.  I found out about it from a friend who saw it on the news and called me at work.  I met his second ex-wife (who I knew nothing about because I hadn't seen my stepfather in more than a decade) at the wake and she wanted to have lunch with me which we did about a week later.  She told me that he had called her two days before his death completely panicked because he said someone was going to kill him.  She contacted CPD officers multiple times but they refused to take her statement and immediately closed my stepfather's case as an accidental death.

4) When my car was parked on the street across the street from the police station it was broken into.  The window was smashed, tape deak stolen, etc.  The desk sergeant at the police station refused to let me file a police report.

5) In 2012 while I was driving in the afternoon on Rogers which is a narrow street in Rogers Park that runs along the Metra train tracks a car sped out of an alley and drove straight into the front of my car.  I expected the driver to get out of his RV but instead he put his vehicle in reverse and sped away driving backwards at a very high speed.  I pursued him for about 4 blocks when he nearly ran over a young mother pushing a stroller and then I decided it was too dangerous and let him drive away.  But my smartphone was in a mount on the car window so I was able to get multiple photographs of the front of his vehicle including a clear view of his license plate.  I printed out the pictures, brought them into the police station about an hour later and again the on duty desk sergeant refused to let me file a police report.  When I asked why he said he didn't need to give me a reason and that if I didn't leave he would have me arrested for disturbing the peace (I was completely calm and never raised my voice because I know better than to give a CPD officer an excuse to beat me up or arrest me).  Charging people with disturbing the peace is the standard thing that CPD officers do when they want to arrest someone who isn't doing anything illegal.  If you question a CPD officer's conduct or irritate them they will inevitably arrest you for disturbing the peace or threaten to arrest you for disturbing the peace.  

6) My wallet was stolen by a pick pocket on the CTA Redline during rush hour when the car was so packed you could barely move because the CTA had run the three previous trains express past the stop I was at.  I tried to report the theft but the desk sergeant refused to allow me to file a police report.

7) About a month later I received statements from a bunch of stores where the person who stole my wallet had opened instant credit accounts.  I called all of the cards and told them I hadn't opened the accounts and was told by one that I needed to go to the police station, file a report number, and give it to them which I was thrilled about, obviously, given my previous experiences trying to file police reports in Chicago.

The desk sergeant this time was a female rookie officer but they had apparently schooled her on the fact that she wasn't supposed to accept police reports.  When I told her the credit company said they needed a report number she said no.  When I asked why she said I couldn't prove that I hadn't opened the accounts myself --which I'm pretty sure isn't a prerequisite for trying to report a crime in other cities.  She threatened to have me arrested for disturbing the peace if I didn't leave the station immediately.  I left her desk but stopped on my way to the door, made a speakerphone call to the creditor telling them they said I needed a police report but the police wouldn't let me file one so what was I supposed to do?  The desk sergeant let me file a police report.

I have a friend who does alarm installs and has a company owned van with power tools and ladders in the back.  At least once a year everyone on a job gets their van broken into at least once and some tools are stolen.  The company insists that the employees file a police report before reporting to their next job but if the break-in happened in Chicago successfully filing a police report can take half of the work day because they have to keep going to different area police stations until they find someone working who will let them file a police report.

When Jodi Weiss was police commander one of his most important reforms involved staffing.  Under the longtime system in Chicago officers are allowed to choose where they work based on seniority and the same number of officers are assigned to high crime areas as neighborhoods with barely any crime.  The latter makes no sense in terms of dealing with crime and the former results in officers with the least amount of experience and training always working in the areas with the most crime.

Jody Weiss decided that officers should be assigned where they were needed rather than where they wanted so there would actually be experienced officers working in high crime areas.  He also adjusted staffing so high crime areas were assigned more officers than low crime areas and created a roving force of officers who instead of being assigned to a specific precinct would be moved into different areas where crime was spiking.

Daley had hired Jody Weiss away from the FBI where he worked for 23 years and worked as the Deputy Assistant to the FBI Chief and as the head of the Philadelphia Field Office which is one of the largest in the country.  Weiss was highly regarded, knew what he was doing, and the CPD Union absolutely hated him.

They were especially incensed that veteran officers were being forced to work in high crime areas and risk their lives instead of being allowed to just sit in their cars eating donuts in low crime neighborhoods.  

Rahm Emanuel promised that Jody Weiss would go if the CPD Union supported his mayoral candidacy after Daley's retirement.  The union got to hand pick his successor and within 6 months the crime rate and murder rates in Chicago both exploded.

Chicago has a high crime rate because we have an absolutely terrible police force that refuses to do their jobs --not because mayors aren't tough on crime.  It's sad that so many people in the city actually buy that bullshit and don't understand what's really going on.

Keep in mind that Daley was corrupt as hell--he was about as far from being a reform politician as you could possibly get but the level of corruption and dysfunction at the CPD was too much even for him to stomach which is why he brought in Jody Weiss to try and fix the department.

In 2018 the CPD was placed under Federal Supervision because of corruption and civil rights violations (which was what Daley had been trying to avoid) and signed a Consent Decree that was supposed to create external oversight and enact multiple reforms and even that has done nothing to reform the Chicago Police Department.  Electing John Catanzara who was so openly corrupt that three consecutive police commanders tried to have him removed from the force and who had been stripped of his police powers as the head of the Union sent a very clear message about the state of reform at the CPD to anyone who bothered to pay attention.",AskChicago,114,1741709003.0,197,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1j8u8rz/why_dont_people_in_this_city_care_about_police/
Recommendation for tourists,"Good afternoon,

I'm going to Chicago in September for Riot Fest \[insert metalhead screaming SLAYER here\], and was looking for some recommendations on other things to do/see, stuff to avoid, food/drink recommendations, etc. I'm driving all the way from Toronto, so I want to spend about 7-10 days there.

I'll start with an odd one: my passenger/buddy/hetero lifemate's a contractor and he likes to see ridiculously rich houses. What would you say is the richest neighbourhood in Chicago?

Regarding accommodations: Riot Fest is at Douglass Park so we don't want to be crazy far from there, but also understand that the areas north and west of the Park are pretty sketch. Anyone have any recommendations for areas to avoid when booking hotels/AirBnBs? I made the mistake of not doing this on one of my last holidays, and while it wasn't too bad, I do understand some parts of Chicago are quite dangerous.

Other than that, I'm hoping to catch a game at Wrigley, but does anyone have any recommendations on stuff to actually see and stuff to avoid? I'm nerdy and certainly would like to see museums, zoos, art galleries. My buddy might like the Sears (like the Skydome, I understand you guys reject the new name) Tower, but that seems a bit too touristy... and also, we have a giant tower in Toronto that we never visit. I'd definitely love to check out some bars that have a speakeasy vibe, and while I'm going there for a punk/metal festival, I'd feel wrong not checking out some local blues. Any recommendations on that?

Finally, food. I was thinking of going to Ricobene's for deep dish (if it was good enough for Boudrain...), but any other recommendations on other local delicacies and spots would be appreciated.

Thanks for any insight. Chicago seems like a fascinating city and microcosm of America, and I really want to make the most of the 7-10 days there.

"Moving to Buena Park, school question!","Hi all,

My family and I are moving to Chicago in November in the Buena Park area. 

Our older son is 5 and he would be attending Brennemann Elementary. 

I have looked for some feedback about that school but it all seems to be old, and the negative stuff focused on the previous principal, who I know was involved in some illegal activity. 

The new principal and Ap have really impressed me from what I’ve seen in videos. 

My questions are:
-	has anyone here sent, or currently sends their kids to Brennemann and how is it?
-	would you advise looking elsewhere?
-	have things improved/continue to improve under the new leadership?
-	how is the student body? Are they distracted and couldn’t care less or are they engaged?
-	I see the math tests are kind of low, are they addressing that?

I would love for my kids to get the diversity and community of a public school and want to avoid private (not because of cost, just because I feel like some private schools give kids a very skewed perspective of the world), but if anyone feels the school is dangerous or not effective I’d love to know that as well. 

I also love that it’s smaller and not as big as something like Walt Disney (which is also very close to us and I’m considering for next year as they’re full up this year).

Crossposted to [r/nostupidquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/s/ePiW5bWrEY)

Edit: according to an article I found when looking up Chicago slang “Flodging"", ""flodgin'"", or ""to flodge"" is slang from the Chicago area that basically means lying, but can more precisely mean to pretend to be something that you are not or pretend to have something that you don't.”
Based on the amount of Chicagoans who have no idea what it means I’’m assuming a unique variant of Chicago slang e.g era or culture specific or just plain made up🫠

Edit 2: according to the comments “Flodging” is specifically black Chicago slang.
The story isn’t set in Chicago the main character is just from there, (he left in his early to mid 20’s)
&amp; it’s more of a movie script than a novel so phonetically spelling the accent should actually be helpful in the slim to none chance of it ever being preformed.
The best way for me to describe the character himself is imagine if the main character from a detective noir movie wasn’t a stereotype, like he’s an actual modern day guy with a personality and lived experience, he got into scraps as a kid that his ma got onto him for, he’s got a favorite corner store, and he try’s to be nice to kids even though he dislikes them. I’m trying to write him as a person not “the protagonist” so little things like saying the frunchroom to a friend after a long day are perfect subtle ways to depth to his personality🙏",AskChicago,254,1724697127.0,1326,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1f1vjx6/what_are_some_chicago_specific_words_phrases_that/

"How viable is moving to ""downtown"" Chicago on a $40k salary?","Basically the title, from both a rent-specific and cost-of-living perspective. I'm looking to move to Chicago later this summer, wondering if I can make this work or if I should look at other cities.

Specifically, I'd like an urban feel, not the suburbs, as I'd like to avoid bringing a car if possible. So a walkable district with good access to public transit would be ideal. A single or studio apartment that's not actively horrible would be good. Bonus points for a diverse area with lots of other young people, active nightlife, that sort of thing.

Is this a pipe dream or something that might be possible? Also if you have any neighborhood/district recommendations, let me know.

ETA: Thanks for all the tips everyone! I clearly did a terrible job communicating this, but by ""downtown"" I did mean busy urban areas, not just The Loop proper. Apologies to all the Chicago natives I offended. Gonna check out Uptown, Edgewater, Lakeview, and a few other neighborhoods, thanks again for the recommendations!",AskChicago,185,1715549214.0,360,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1cqiihf/how_viable_is_moving_to_downtown_chicago_on_a_40k/
Reverse Commute to Hoffman Estates?,"I recently accepted a job offer in Hoffman Estates and will be moving to Chicago from Ohio in the next month or so. I'm set on living in the city as I want to experience that lifestyle and thats where the majority of my Chicago friends are. I am currently apartment hunting, was just in town to tour some spots, and wanted to get some more insight from y'all on how the neighborhood I choose might impact my reverse commute.

So heres my situation. I toured a great unit in Wicker/Bucktown 5 minutes from an I-90 on ramp. It's checking almost all the boxes for my situation, but long story short, I talked to the landlord and there were a few applications that rolled in before mine and it seems like someone else is most likely going to get the unit. The only other places I toured that would work for me are in Lake View and Uptown, but I understand that would make my commute longer. So now I'm torn between scheduling some virtual tours in Wicker/Bucktown or just going with one of the units in Lake View/Uptown.

I wouldn't have to be in Chicago until late Jan, but I would love to be moved in by the end of 2025. With that being said, I don't really want to extend my search and/or risk one of these units that I like in Lake View/Uptown getting snatched. But if living in those areas is going to add significant time to my commute, I would be willing to keep looking.

**Does anyone have any insight on how much time living in Uptown/Lake View would add to my commute vs. living around Wicker? I don't really know anyone who is making this long of a commute, so if you are in a similar boat as me, I would love to hear your experience as well. Appreciate any insight!**

Some additional context is my job is hybrid (T-TH in office) and the company is looking to relocate the office into the city in 2026, so would only have to thug it out for a year at most. I also would probably hit the gym post work or find something to kill some time to avoid the post-work rush hour.",AskChicago,24,1765680022.0,112,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1pm34lq/reverse_commute_to_hoffman_estates/
I am moving to Chicago soon and need a lot of advice to prepare me for the winter?,"Hey, I was applying to jobs before I previously posted my previous question about moving to Chicago, and I landed one with good pay! I'm not exactly sure of my move-in date as of yet because I have online onboarding training before floor training, though I would like to move as soon as possible to settle in. I am from California and have never experienced a true winter, so I need a LOT of advice:

Car: I bought my 2010 Honda Civic LX earlier this year, it's my baby so I would like to bring it with me. I have never driven in snowy areas before, so I was wondering what equipment I will need to buy before moving or after moving. Will I need snow chains or a different type of tire, and out of those two (or other options I don't know about), which is the safer option and which is the cheaper option? Will I need anything else?

Driving: What are some things that are most likely to occur while driving (skidding, etc.), and what should I do to avoid it or get out of the situation? I will try my best to use public transportation more often once I'm there, but while driving my car from California to Illinois I would like to be aware of what may happen, even if I leave early enough in November/December before the snow starts falling heavily. I will also drive slowly to be careful. Also, when is snow expected to start falling this winter?

Clothing: I am female and live in a generally warm area in California. I own mostly thinner tops and jackets, jeans, one slightly cropped puffer jacket and pair of snow shoes I used when I saw snow for the first time earlier this year. The puffer jacket and shoes are pretty warm, so I plan on wearing it if it's snowing when I move over there, and am planning to purchase actual warm clothes once I get over there. My thoughts are to get thermals (amazon), sweaters and sweatshirts, non-ripped jeans and sweatpants (what are some other warm pants?), a good coat, a longer puffer jacket, and if I can I would like to get a nice leather jacket (but that can wait). I also want to get earmuffs, winter hats, some scarves (I have literally never worn a scarf properly before), and possibly more shoes (I want ones I can walk and run in that are warm, but assuming I will have to do that at a gym and not out in the snow for too long, correct me if I'm wrong). Someone recommended that I also get bodysuits to go under the thermals, but I'm uncertain if that is necessary (my extremities tend to get the coldest over my torso). For everything I listed, if anyone has any recommendations for these items that are on the cheaper side and still warm, please let me know. Also, let me know if I am missing any parts of the layering process!

Also, if there is anything else anyone would recommend to prepare me for the Chicago winter, please let me know!",AskChicago,7,1761403039.0,120,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1oft4xy/i_am_moving_to_chicago_soon_and_need_a_lot_of/

People who moved to Lakeview first: where did you end up?,"I've been in Chicago for a bit over a year and a half now, and I've been in the Lakeview area.

Reasons I love Lakeview, for reference:

* Super walkable - I don't have a car since moving here, but I also work remotely and therefore don't have a commute
* Feels less commercial than places like Gold Coast and River North. I like the number of independent restaurants, for instance
* Reasonable transit access
* Bike infrastructure is improving
* It's easy to convince people to come visit since there's so much around
* Access to the lake.

Help out a writer looking for info on Chicago neighborhoods?,"Hey Chicago! I'm working on a short story with a protagonist who comes from your city, and I'm trying to figure out what part of town he comes from. I don't need a street address, just an approximate area.

His family is lower-middle class, and he was born sometime in the early 2000s, although the story starts in the late 2010s while he's a teenager. Anyone able to point me to parts of the city (or possibly suburbs) that seem like likely places for him to have grown up? 

Thanks!

EDIT: White, culturally ""American"" (his ancestors have been in the country long enough that his family doesn't really think of themselves strongly as having a particular ethnic background).

EDIT 2: Since y'all want more info: At the outset of the story, he's 15 years old towards the end of his freshman year of high school. He's living in an area where it's safe enough for him to take the bus to the library and back in broad daylight, despite not being an expert in self-defense. (He knows enough to know how to avoid trouble, but hasn't spent much time learning much about how to deal with trouble if it comes up.)
His dad works in manufacturing and his mom works part time as a substitute middle school teacher. He's got a decent relationship with both of them, and is very close to his little brother. He enjoys informal basketball and soccer, but doesn't much care for organized sports. He loves gaming, and wants to become a writer for video games when he grows up. He's got a small but close group of friends. I don't know many details about them, since they won't ever show up and I can base things like ethnicity and such on where he's from.

EDIT 3: Thanks so much to most of you for helping me out! To the few of you who decided to just mock my lack of knowledge about Chicago: why do you think I was asking the question in the first place? Grow up.

Trying to avoid too young or old of a crowd for meeting, and ideally somewhere more social. I will throw out my worst pick up lines

•	⁠Activities: I had a trivia group in my previous city and I’ve seen more active groups like walking/run clubs are big here. Any specific recs in this area?

•	⁠Lurking: There are some grocery stores, coffee shops and parks I could post up at in the area. I like dogs, and feel more comfortable hanging alone in these locations if anyone knows where I’d have the best luck. I hear Midwest people can be easier to strike up some small talk, and dogs (I don’t have one) usually break the ice

How hard is it to get a job at Chicago Public Schools? And is getting an apartment really that difficult?,"Hey y'all. I just recently visited some friends in Chicago for the first time and absolutely fell in love with the city. Since then, all I have been able to think about is moving there and I am very committed to it. For context, I currently live in Texas where I am a public school teacher. So the plan would be to secure a job at CPS and then take some time to find an apartment (1 Bed, 1 Bath) and make the move over the summer to teach for the 2026-2027 school year. Thankfully, I have an entire year to plan this out and get my finances in order for the move. My two biggest obstacles/questions are:

**1.) How hard is it to get a job teaching at Chicago Public Schools?**

I imagine that like most of the country, Chicago and Illinois as a whole have a teacher shortage, but how hard would it be as someone out-of-state? What is the interview process like? And when is the best time of year to start looking for jobs? For context, I teach middle school social studies and am also thinking about getting certified in English to make myself as attractive a candidate as possible. I would like to teach in either the North or West side. I will be in my third year teaching by the time I make this hypothetical move and have only taught at Title 1 schools. However, if there is some areas I should absolutely avoid, please let me know.

**2.) How hard is it to get an apartment in Chicago?**

I understand that this is a broad question so let me provide some context: my plan would be to secure a job first and then start apartment hunting like crazy. Preferably somewhere that is no more than a 40 minute commute to both the school I would work at and my friends who live all around the North/West side. My budget would be no more than $1350 a month for a one bed one bath. I am curious to how realistic this is for a decent place in these parts of town. This move would obviously happen during the summer where I heard can get quite hectic. I've heard that the market is quite competitive but I want to save myself as much heartache as possible, but I understand that I will have to make some sacrifices no matter what.

Thanks in advance for anyone willing to give some advice. Apologies for the longish post but its literally all I can think about since I visited lol.

Anyone commute from Gary to Chicago? Or have some connection to Gary in some way?,"What up doe. So I live in the Detroit area and make a trip to Chicago once in a while. Checked out Gary the last time I was out near Chicago. Lots of people work in Chicago and reside in Gary where property taxes are cheaper. [The video about Gary from RocaNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8R45ZJkzTk) interviewed a few residents who claimed Gary was safer than the parts of south Chicago they moved out of. 

From what I can say about Gary from my brief visit, it isn't bad. The beach is nice, someone told me they come from Chicago to swim there because the alternative is to go further to the north for clean swimming water. Met a guy fishing who said he commutes to Chicago, Gary has cheaper living expenses. I get the sense Gary flies under everyone's radar. 

It didn't seem dangerous to walk around. Seemed chill and laid back.

Gary is like a city of villages. [Duncan Campbell calls Detroit a city of villages when interviewed with RocaNews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ropTEfzpG5I), the book Re-Imagine Detroit by John Gallagher has several chapters on that.

"First time in Chicago — should I stay downtown or near McCormick Place, and how to commute from downtown?","Hi! I’m going to Chicago in mid-April for a conference at McCormick Place and I’ll be there for a week. I was wondering whether I should stay at a hotel near McCormick Place or downtown. I’d like to save on Uber/transportation costs, but if it’s not a great area to stay in (I read southside is really dangerous) I can pay extra to stay downtown. I’m not American and I’m not very familiar with the public transportation system. If I stay downtown, what would be the safest and most convenient way to get to McCormick Place using public transportation (train, bus, etc.)? I’d also like to know approximately how long the commute usually takes and how much it costs.

Finally, since I’ll be visiting in April, I wanted to ask about the weather. What kind of temperatures should I expect, and what would you recommend bringing in terms of clothing?

Thanks in advance!!

Edit: I’ve also had some concerns after seeing some news about ICE raids. I’m Latina, which makes me a bit anxious, even though I’ll obviously be traveling legally for a conference.

"Where should I live in Chicago if I'm commuting to East Chicago, IN?","Hi! I’ll be moving from Dallas to Chicago this summer for an internship and would love some advice on the best living/commuting setup. I’ll be working in East Chicago, IN, five days a week.

I’m 21F and have visited Chicago before (early February) and absolutely loved it, so I'm excited to see what the summer has to offer. I’m really into art, theater, music, and generally want to be in an area where it’s easy to meet people and explore the city. I plan on spending a lot of time downtown and around different neighborhoods.

I’m totally fine using public transportation for getting around the city, but my job requires me to have my own car, so I won’t be able to use transit for my daily commute. Ideally, I’d like to live somewhere not too far north since I know the commute could get rough, but still relatively close to downtown. I’ve heard good things about River North and the Loop, but I’m open to other suggestions.

I regularly commute 30–45 minutes in Dallas, so traffic doesn’t scare me too much. That said, is there anything specific I should know about driving to East Chicago? Is there a big difference between taking toll roads vs avoiding them?

I’ll be receiving a housing stipend, so cost isn’t my biggest concern. Parking availability is more important, especially for days when I’m not using my car.

How much to pay for rent? Affordability?,"Hello,



I’m requesting your help, where possible, regarding a budget for housing.



Currently, my salary is $40,000. I live in the city of Chicago (Northside) (High cost of living).



Studios are about $1,100 (typically, with all utilities included) in &amp; around my zip code (Very high).



I haven’t lived on my own before. I couldn’t really afford it. Unfortunately, an immediate family member recently passed away. I’ve been living with a sibling. The rent has increased to $1,100. The rent is divided amongst us for $550 each person. However, I’m needing to obtain new housing relatively soon. 



The housing would be for one person (self). I currently do not have a car. I take public transportation to my job. I do not have a credit card. I currently do not have a credit history.



I’ve also been thinking about purchasing a small property nearby. However, a lender states that I can try to start a “manual underwriting” process &amp; with FHA. I do not know much about how this process works. 



I’m also short on time. I may need to end up renting first. 



What amount would you say is considered “reasonable” for rent, based on my salary and area of living? This is also considering any potential rent increases. 



\*\*Also, please explain any calculations, if you need to provide them.\*\*



(Note: I don’t know of any roommates. I prefer not having roommates for safety reasons &amp; to avoid any possible financial issues. However, if finding acceptable roommates may be the best option at this time, what amount would you say is considered “reasonable” to rent with roommate(s)?)



(Lastly, for now, do you know if there any safe areas that have low rents in Illinois? In addition, to a good market for finding employment?)

Got Low-Income Romantic Date Ideas?," Hey there, Chicago. My girlfriend and I are a sapphic trans couple in our mid twenties &amp; early 30s. We've been together for 6 months now, and I really want to take her on a romantic evening to celebrate. Though I'm 32, She is actually my 1st ever girlfriend/relationship. I was lonely for a long time &amp; starting to think a relationship would never happen for me. Then I met her &amp; she warmed my heart. Being in love with her makes me feel like a teenager again &amp; I'm letting myself do all the mushy romantic shit I've never been able to before. 

 She's just texted me to say she's coming over tomorrow (her work schedule changes every week, so I never know when her days off will be). I got us matching babydoll dresses from hottopic that are covered in vintage drawings of kittens, so we will look cute! My dilemma is that we'll be all dressed up with nowhere to go. I am in a wheelchair and living on disability income, so I have very very little disposable income. In an ideal world, I'd be able to take her to a romantic restaurant; the kind with a fireplace &amp; sofa seating in the dining area so we could sit side by side and cuddle over dinner. Everything like that I've looked at so far has incredibly expensive food, &amp; many appear to have cramped dining areas that would be difficult to navigate in a wheelchair.

TAP allows disabled people to take cab rides for just $2, so I can get us anywhere in the city no problem. Please do remember I'm in a wheelchair tho!

Leaving the Dairyland for the Windy City. Help a Wisconsinite out?,"Good morning, neighbors from the South!

As a proud Wisconsinite, I’ve always had an affinity for the city of Chicago, as it reminds me of my travels around the world. The copious options for incredible food, the dream of walkability, the quick access to travel, and the rich, inspiring cultures all make it such a captivating place. There are so many things I find amazing about the city that I can’t even begin to enumerate them, which is why I see myself thriving there.

I’ve done some research and am seriously considering making the move. However, I’ve noticed that HOA fees in many areas can be quite steep, so I’m looking at neighborhoods like Oak Park. It seems to offer decent proximity to the city along with access to public transit and ease of travel, while potentially keeping costs more manageable.

That said, I realize it’s quite possible that as a visitor, I’ve only seen the benefits and the pretty side of Chicago. I may very well be missing critical pieces that could change my perspective or my plan. So please feel free to share the good, the bad, and the ugly—everything I should be considering before making this move.

My biggest concern as a military veteran is how moving to Illinois might impact my benefits. I’m aware that taxes, in general, are higher, and I’d like to avoid the 10%+ sales tax if possible. I believe sales tax in areas outside of downtown is closer to 6.75%, but I could be mistaken.

I currently live about two hours away (with good traffic), and I just want to ensure this transition is the right financial and lifestyle decision for me.

Already had a Lou Malnati’s moment (underwhelmed), and also ate at Little Goat Diner, The Wieners Circle, Itoko, and Farm Bar.

Adler Planetarium is one of the only things I didn’t get to do last time, but not trying to spend the entire day there.

Some questions about moving from Houston to Chicago?,"I’m planning on making the move to Chicago within 6 months to a year. I’m sick of Houston, it depresses me, I don’t think most people really want to be here. I’ve decided on Chicago for a few reasons: 

1. It’s a vibrant and well-liked city. I hear good things, people seem to enjoy living there. I could use public transportation, walking, arts, culture, city stuff. 


2. I have family that’s also moving there. I’d have my cousin, and her fiancée who’s been there for generations. I wouldn’t be going in without connections. 

3. Cost of living seems reasonable. It’s a little higher than Houston, but the pay for the job I’d be in is also a little higher. 

Okay, questions: 

1. I want to be in a happening area, but not one that’s too dangerous. I’d like to write, and do journalism, I’m also in my 30s. Is there any area I should be looking in that fits my desires? 

2. How’s making friends? I’d like to be able to join groups, meet people, generally be a part of things. How feasible is that for a newcomer to Chicago? 

3. Anything else I should know? ",AskChicago,0,1752041719.0,34,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1lvbhzg/some_questions_about_moving_from_houston_to/
What is the minimum temperature you would go for a workout in shorts in?,"Assuming you still wear a running coat and cap, and no tights. As someone who lives in the Pacific Northwest, I've run in shorts down to 30°F if there is sun and little wind, but 30°F here can feel like 20°F in the Midwest where it's a lot sunnier. I definitely don't advise doing this if you're not in an urban or suburban area with easy access to the indoors. I often find myself wearing the same jackets and layers on a 45°F dreary day versus a 25°F sunny day in the Midwest or East Coast.

I know this sounds a bit stupid, but with the harsh cold weather sweeping across the northern USA, a 30°F sunny day can feel pleasant if there is no wind. What makes winter difficult isn't the cold itself but the snow and ice storms which make traveling dangerous and difficult. Same with the freaking wind and wind chill. Then there is the darkness and lack of sun, which can be a major problem where I live. It's been literally over a month since I have last seen a sunny clear day. I personally don't mind the darkness, but walking in a dimly lit street at 6pm when the sky is pitch black can be scary for many people. At this point, telling a winter hater to ""just buy a better jacket"" is like me telling a businessperson to ""just get an Airbnb"" when they complain about hotels being too expensive, since it skips a ton of nuance. Many people are okay with having to tough everything out. Whether it comes to acclimatization, or needing to put a dent in their bank accounts for traveling.

What do to on a Chicago trip… for an 80 year old’s birthday?,"Hey everybody! I live here, but am hoping the group might have some ideas to help me out. My great aunt is turning 80 this summer, and it was on her bucket list to visit Chicago. Obviously, we’re making that happen. It has now turned into a bit of a girls trip and there will be 9 of us and besides me (age 27) everybody is 50+.

I’ve lived in Roger’s Park for almost a decade, but am looking for some touristy suggestions. I also know we have a big group so want to plan accordingly. They are requesting the skydeck so I think we’ll be doing that, and I am making SURE we do the architecture boat tour. We’ll go see the bean and the fountain. Besides that, I’m not sure what to prioritize. This will be the first “big city” experience for a few of these ladies, so I don’t want it to be too busy and overwhelming, but want to make sure they get a real taste of what Chicago has to offer.

The trip is from noon on a Sunday until Tuesday morning. We are staying up north by me (so they’ll see the beach and get a bit of the north side vibe) and we’ll be using the red line to get downtown and probably public transit generally.

I am looking for suggestions for:

Travel advice for a first timer from the UK ?,"Hi guys, I'm from the UK and we would love to plan a trip to Chicago next year in September or October.

We could potentially rent a car but as we drive on the left here it would be quite nerve wracking for me especially if we pick the car up in a city like Chicago.

But I would love to see a bit more of the State if possible.
• how is your public transport?
• is September / October a good time of year?
• how long do you recommend staying in Chicago?
• any districts/areas in Chicago to avoid?
• best areas in Chicago to stay?
• do you have any recs beside the usual touristy bits?

(Will deffo do the boat tour!)

Or if you think 10 days for Illinois is not enough especially not without a car, do you recommend splitting half of the days in Chicago and then maybe fly to a different city as you guys have good domestic flight options (someone recommended Washington

Solo work trip to Chicago (first time) with 2 days free to explore - what should I do/see?,"Hi everyone, 

I am travelling from Europe to Chicago for a work conference in a couple weeks and it will be my first time in the area. 

I am staying near O’Hara (Rosemont area) because it’s near the conference location but I do have 1.5-2 days of free time before hand to explore and would love to hear what you think I should do. For context, I am a woman and will be travelling solo. 

I am keen to do the river architecture trip as everyone seems to rave about it and I do love to photograph buildings. I also love visiting book shops and nice cafes with good coffee and matcha (if they have great baked goods even better). 

Because I have limited time to explore I guess my main questions are: 
- What is, in your opinion, the best/safest way to travel into the city from Rosemont? 
- I’d be quite keen to visit a specific shop which is in Wicker Park (N Damen) - what else should I do around that area? 
- Any top coffee shop/bookshop recs? 
- Anything I absolutely shouldn’t skip? 
- Anything best avoided? 
- If you had to recommend a single food item I should try in the area what would that be (and where is the best spot to get it)?

- I enjoy walkability since I have a masters in urban planning
- I’ll be working in a building right along millennium park
- have 2 cars but down to get rid of them if possible

- favorite grocery store?
- how’s the political outlook of the new mayor? Same with the governor?

Thoughts on needing a car in the city,"Hello r/AskChicago

I’m looking for some advice and wisdom about my current dilemma: my car is old and on its last leg, and I’ve been planning on getting a new one before making the move out there. But I’m starting to reconsider if that’s even necessary. 

I’m planning on moving out to the city in about a month.  I’m from out of state but my partner is local (kinda, she’s in west burbs right now). We’re going to be living in the Logan square / Humboldt park area. I know the area isn’t the safest, but also not particularly dangerous. I’m pretty street smart and I don’t make problems for myself, but I do respect that Chicago is a big city and things can happen.

We wouldn’t have any parking access besides street parking, which I’ve been told is pretty standard for the area we’re moving into, it’s not abundant but not a nightmare. I’ll be fully work from home remote, so I wouldn’t have a commute. I don’t typically drive very often and like to walk or take public transportation as often as possible. And my partner has an old car too, so we would be able to share hers in a pinch. But I am unsure if I’d be able to utilize the metra and other bus options well and safe enough to justify not having a car. 


So Please, let me know what your thoughts on my situation are. Do you think I need a car, or would I be fine with a bus pass and my own two feet (and some Ubers occasionally)?",AskChicago,12,1709156652.0,94,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1b2if6s/thoughts_on_needing_a_car_in_the_city/

I’ll be traveling to Chicago from Aug 30 to Sept 6 for business meetings and workshops through my company. This will be my first-ever US trip, and I had options to choose between Philadelphia, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Orlando. I was already leaning toward Chicago, and thanks to some helpful folks on r/USTravel my decision got reinforced.

I’ll arrive at ORD on Sat, Aug 30 at 4 PM local time. I should have some time to explore that evening (I’m pretty active, so I think I’ll be fine). I’ll then have all of Sunday and Labor Day (Mon, Sept 1) to explore, plus evenings free after 5:30 PM from Tue–Fri.

After my business trip, I plan to fly from Chicago to NYC on the morning of Sept 6 to spend 3 nights there before heading back to India on Sept 9.

About Me
	
•	M33, based in India (this will be my 2nd international trip – first was London last year for 8 days).
	
•	Interests → art, museums, science, tech, landscapes, parks. Slightly afraid of heights, so might skip observation decks unless they’re absolutely worth it.
	
•	Food → love good food &amp; beer. I don’t eat beef/pork but wouldn’t mind trying if the dish is really good.

	
•	Work will cover my stay, food/drinks, and cabs till Sept 6 (likely staying downtown, hotel TBD). All sightseeing will be out of pocket.

Questions I’d Love Help With:

2.	Is it safe to be out till 11 PM–12 AM on Sunday/Monday nights?
	
3.	Weather looks pleasant—planning to bring just a light jacket. Should I pack anything extra?
	
4.	Tipping – I really don’t want to under-tip or offend anyone. For a $50 dinner, what’s a fair tip?
	
5.	Is CityPASS worth it, or is it cheaper to pay for each attraction separately?
	
6.	For my ORD → JFK flight on Sept 6, I’ll have 2 medium trolley bags, 1 cabin bag, and a backpack – how much extra should I expect to pay for baggage?
	
7.	Any must-try dishes, local specialties, or restaurants/bars you’d recommend?

I am relocating in January, but I won’t be able to visit until December for only a few days, so I am trying to do research on areas in advance to maximize my short time there.
I am relocating for grad school, and it’s a 1-year program that I need to be close to the Loop for. I don’t want to be IN the Loop, so I’ve been looking at Streeterville.
My partner and I don’t drink or party, so River North seemed a bit too wild. Since I’m coming in January and it’s going to be a quick and brutal adjustment to the cold, I figured staying close to the train and just accepting the Uber ride at night if I have to would be best.
We wouldn’t bring a car, so that works out fine.
Since we have a cat, I would like to avoid radiator heating or electric heating instead. I’m not sure and just based on my research, that’s what I’m gathering. We are looking at $2,400-2,700 for rent, which I feel is obtainable in January based on what I see currently in the market.

Is it unreasonable to think my daughter will be able to go to sleep earlier in the evening? (Will bring a white noise machine too to help)

Also happy if the answer is neighborhood dependent and there’s one or two areas we should avoid because of street festivities. I think we’ll try to be far enough from Navy Pier since it looks like there’s a bunch of stuff there…but not sure how abundant and spread out all the fireworks are..?

A garage is a definite must have as I’m pretty big on personal projects (woodworking + cars). My wife is really into gardening/plants and cooking. We’re both pretty big homebodies but do like to venture into the city from time to time. Decent proximity to grocery stores(bonus points for Asian grocery stores) and big box stores (Costco, target, etc) would be awesome.

From rough research seems like we’d want to look into the western burbs or north&amp; northwest burbs.

I personally could care less for living in the city (lived in SF AND NY) but want to make sure her thoughts are atleast explored. 

Ideally my max door to door commute time would be 1 hour.  She is taking advantage of the situation to take some career time off, so just need to worry about my commute time for now

Help me choose a neighborhood?,"Me (21NB) &amp; my girlfriend (22F) are looking to move to Chicago in the coming year, and are trying to figure out which neighborhood would be best to move to. We have plans to visit, but not much money to work with in order to do so. Unless we can find someone to stay with, we'll likely only get a few days. So, I'd like to narrow down my options as much as possible before then.

Both of us are trans, leftist, and working artists. Local art markets are a plus, but as we both work independently we don't have a set location for jobs. In general, having an art community to connect with others our fields is the most important thing.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Queer community. Bonus points if there's a big trans community
- Art/Indie film scene. 
- Walkable/Good public transit. Neither of us own a car and do not plan to.
- AFFORDABLE. This is the snag with most places we've looked at. Low cost of living is a must.

WANTS:
- Somewhere that skews younger.
- Access to movie theaters through public transit.
- Coffee shops, record stores, thrifting.
- Local music acts.
- A place where you can be social without drinking.

At this point, we're pretty torn between Logan Square and Rogers Park. I love the artsy hipster vibe and access to the blue line in Logan, but I'm worried about cost of living. I'm being priced out of my current city due to very rapid gentrification and would like to avoid a repeat of that. Rogers Park seems more on the sleepy &amp; family-oriented side, but is a lot less risky price-wise.

What are some nice neighborhoods for home bodies?,"My wife and I are considering moving to Chicago from Brooklyn this year. We’ve read a ton of posts and feel like we have a general sense of the neighborhoods. One thing i’ve noticed is most users here often recommend areas based on someone younger that likes to go out often. What about the opposite? We’re mid to late thirties, introverts, we do like to go out to museums and to eat, but those don’t have to be within walking distance. Day to day we really only may go for a walk just to walk, or to the grocery, or the gym. We don’t go out drinking often. Considering all of this we’ve put more focus on spending a bit more on our home space here in Brooklyn; a high rise in Prospect Heights if that matters to anyone. We’re not opposed to single family homes or midrises though. 

Based on all of this what areas do you think have nice homes/condos, fewer vermin issues, and not super loud with drunk college bros? We’ll be looking for a 2bed, budget is up to $600k or so.

**Edit:** Tons of great suggestions! I will say I think I may have overemphasized the ""not super loud"" part, or people took it to mean very quiet neighborhoods. I really just meant that I don't want to be inside and hear music blaring and people partying all night.

What are some ideas/suggestions for a Chicago staycation?,"Hi everyone,

I have some expiring PTO (5 days) that I need to use by the end of July. I was thinking about going in a solo vacation to LA, and while that completely isn’t off the table I am working on a tight budget and know deep down that I should avoid it despite wanting to explore (never really traveled much growing up). Another thing is that I would most likely be solo since my friends are either busy/not interested. With that being said, I am open to suggestions on what to do during this time off.

A little about myself is that I have grown up in the south suburbs my entire life. I’ve been to Chicago many times, shit I’m there 5 days a week bc of work. I haven’t really explored a whole lot tho. I’ve done the basic stuff growing up (Sears Tower, Navy Pier, Museums, etc). Now that I am older, I am thinking about visiting different neighborhoods and areas outside of the loop. 

I enjoy sports, but don’t necessarily want to go to Wrigley or see the White Sox play (I’ve done that plenty of times). I really want to try new restaurants and cafes (nothing upscale, but restaurants that are “heavily” acclaimed for a reasonable price (i.e. Au Cheval)). I like music and nightlife, but at the same time I am more introverted and feel a little intimidated going to bars by myself when others are typically in groups. The beaches are nice but we are having a company outing to the beach next week. Lastly, I enjoy history but don’t want to spend much money doing so museums might be out of the question (unless if some are free or are fairly cheap). 

With all that being said, what are some suggestions you would recommend? Anything works, could be restaurants, events, or even traveling out of state and visiting cities such as Milwaukee.

Posting Because People Keep Asking Me: Are you wondering if it's possible to live in/near Chicago and commute to AbbVie/Abbott on the North Shore WITHOUT driving?,"Several people reached out to me after I answered this question once so I wanted to put up a post here for reference.

Short answer: yes! Just live near a Metra UP-N stop. I have a couple friends who work at AbbVIe and live in/immediately outside of Chicago and do it daily. It's very easy and they get to work in/around an hour without having to drive.

AbbVie/Abbott campuses are way up on the North Shore and appear to be very far from the actual city of Chicago. The METRA UP-N train runs very close to all of their sites and AbbVie (and I'd imagine Abbott too) run shuttles to and from the Metra stops in the mornings and afternoons. The exact shuttle schedule I'm not sure of but I'm sure AbbVie/Abbott staff who help with relocation can provide those. I've heard that AbbVie also has their own ""Uber""-esq free car service where you can request rides between sites (and after the shuttles stop if working early/late) and I think there are also shuttles that run between the different sites.

One of my close friends lives in Ravenswood and another lives in Evanston. They both live walking distance to the Metra UP-N stops (Ravenswood and Evanston-Davis St). They both take about an hour to get to work (including the shuttle ride to their sites). My Evanston friend also drives occasionally and it takes about 50 minutes driving (he takes Route 41 N to avoid tolls).

Stops to Live Near in Chicago proper: Ogilvie (major train station/transit center, southernmost stop down in the ""heart"" of the city), Clybourn, Ravenswood, Peterson/Ridge, Rogers Park

Evanston stops (not Chicago but first city right outside of Chicago): Main (southernmost, last stop outside of Chi), Davis (best ""downtown"" part of Ev), Central

\^ Will not need a vehicle for most of these areas.

Other cities I've heard my friends mention their coworkers enjoy living: Highland Park, Waukegan, Libertyville. You'll ~~likely~~ need a car for these areas.

Please feel free to ask me questions and I can try and grab the answers from these friends who do this daily, I hope that this little post makes the idea of commuting less intimidating for those who are unfamiliar with Chicago.

ETA: I have no affiliation with AbbVie/Abbott, just hear a lot about it from my two friends. Also check out the autoMOD post about neighborhoods below. It's very helpful.",AskChicago,57,1744290172.0,14,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1jvxd6w/posting_because_people_keep_asking_me_are_you/

Moving to Chicago from Albuquerque,"Hello! I’m seriously considering moving to Chicago with my best friend from Albuquerque, NM and wondering if anyone has any tips. The main things:

- My friend and I want to live somewhere in the Loop (we are astonished daily that rent prices are almost comparable to ABQ there). Does anyone have any suggestions on where to look for decent apartments, buildings to avoid, etc.? I will most likely be working remotely, I don’t know what he plans to do yet. (edit): I plan to try to get a job that is more established in my desired field once I have a bit more agency work which is what I’m working on right now. I am hoping to make moves toward community focused marketing and project management in the public sector, for instance, helping run political campaigns, nonprofits, charitable funds, etc.. My friend is a brewer and also wants to do comedy at night. 

- I would love to keep my car but don’t necessarily need it in the city. I need to be able to regularly travel to Rochester, MN (about 1-2x/month) and would like to be able to make the drive instead of fly. Are there any parking options in the outer city that I might be able to get to from the L? If anyone has any other suggestions that’d be awesome! I’ve heard having a car in the city is a huge pain so any info is appreciated. 

- I’ve read about the winters and know that will be an adjustment. Winters in ABQ get down in the 30s at the lowest (sometimes 20s if mother nature is feeling cheeky), but it’s almost always sunny, which I hear is very different in Chicago. How do you all fair with seasonal depression? The cold I can handle, but SAD is my biggest worry lol. 

- I’m not super worried about crime because, well, I grew up in Albuquerque, but any info on areas to avoid and things to watch out for would be appreciated!

If there’s anything else you think I should know, any info is appreciate! Thank you! 

edit: Thank you for everyons help! A few of you have asked for more details so for those interested, here it is. I am looking to move mainly for career and graduate school reasons. I’m very interested in programs at both Northwestern and the University of Chicago but most of them want more work experience post undergraduate so that is what I am working on, along with what I said above. As far as my interests go, I have to admit I’m more interested in day life than night life, particularly coffee shops, farmers markets, museums, and nice places to hang out and do work. I like to be outside so, obviously in the summer, it’d be nice to have easy access to parks and nice places to walk/run. That said, I’m still very interested in nightlife, it’s just not the most important thing. I’m not a huge drinker. Ultimately, I’ve always wanted to live in a city and the most important thing to me is I get to experience living in a big city. I love the fast pace and bustle of cities and I want to live in an area that’s like that. 

My friend has a lot of similar goals with the city. He originally suggested the loop after hearing about that being the heart of downtown from some friends (although that seems to be conflicting with what some of you all say). He wants to be around that fast pace. I think he will definitely want a bit more nightlife as he wants to try to pursue comedy, but he also loves the day life stuff too. He does not know where he will be working but it will likely be in the brewing industry because he is currently a manager at a large brewery in New Mexico. 

We both want the city experience we didn’t get growing up in Albuquerque, and want to pursue our career goals.

Is this too close to the CTA tracks as far as noise is concerned?,"Hi Chicago,

I am moving to the area in a few months and I was looking at some apartments here that fit my budget and space needs. This apartment is somewhat close to cta tracks, but I don't know exactly how loud it is and how far that travels- I am not too picky on sound but I'm wondering if that curve squeals a lot and if it's going to be unbearably loud being that close to the tracks.

Here's where I'm talking about: [https://imgur.com/a/DuvIcIg](https://imgur.com/a/DuvIcIg)

Obviously I won't know for sure until I'm inside of the apartment. But I just wanted to know if there's a general radius to stay far enough from cta tracks to avoid it being disturbingly loud, so I can decide if my limited time to find an apartment is worth setting up a showing. I want to be close to cta.... but not too close... if that makes sense.

Trying to move to Chicago with basically nothing and would love guidance(mainly for public transit),"Hello,I'm from Florida and I'm in a BAD point in life so I'm planning on moving to Chicago A.S.A.P,since C.O.L is crazy basically everywhere now I know the top 3(NYC,Chi,L.A)are equipped with services,better pay,transit,and etc so I aimed at them. I decided on Chicago since it seems like a split of both NYC and L.A(burb style homes in Chicagoland,city life in Chicago and Lake Michigan is honestly beautiful from pictures I've seen)better bang for buck(plus there's legit is not much difference/any difference in Chicago vs Jacksonville in 2023 rent wise...),and the people sound more authentic,even the homeless shelter I called there(Uptown Cornerstone)the lady was a personal/homely level nice vs business nice like I was getting in L.A when I was trying to get help(I actually got help PLUS more than I originally asked on the Chicago call vs the multiple calls/emails with L.A lol)

So since I have VERY limited funds to my name I don't plan on getting a bus to Chicago until I'm sure I have a job lined up(nothing major,minimum wage alone is good since I do ecommerce on the side and can actually blossom to my full potential now with income and vs before AND debts)so when I go I can live in a motel(s) and not be wasting money.The problem I'm having is I'm not used to public transit and don't know how to use them and since I have limited funds I don't want to just go there and try to learn it while paying to stay in a motel draining money.

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of figured out the busses due to me eyeing staying in the motel 6 in Schiller Park(I think I was on the Chicago's bus site and it showed it a bit with directions that I made up from there to figure out how this works),well while I was reading around on here I saw people say the trains are better since they are straight shots/no traffic and was wondering is there a way to learn how to use them?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to learn as much as possible on transit before I go there because like I said when I go that means a job already accepted me so I'd like to atleast be in the ballpark of knowing so I can figure it out from there.Also if anybody has any extra pointers I may not have covered I'm all ears,especially if you have tips on housing with little to nothing to my name(not against the idea of homeless shelters in the slightest),like are there any kind of extended stays or motels that have better rates for long term living and areas to try and avoid as a new comer/trying to learn the city.

Is Edgewater cool late at night?,"Yes.. another post about safety.

I was in a real bind and running out of time when I was doing my apartment search and without doing much research, I signed a lease in Edgewater on the SW corner of Kenmore &amp; Glenlake. I have been doing some research on the area, just trying to see what cool and fun stuff might be over there, when I came across a map of gang territories and saw that my apartment is within a small block that apparently has gang activity in it.

Anyways, I know that if I mind my business I should be fine. I am curious though- should I be at all worried? I can't help but to feel uneasy that I picked one of the 2 blocks in Edgewater that have gang activity. I honestly can't find much recent information about Edgewater in general online, I take it that's because it's a relatively quiet place with not much going on. I did see lots of storefronts were abandoned, but that doesn't bother me really.

A lot of what I read online says that east of broadway can be dodgy, but a lot of those posts are 3-10 years old. I am not really sure what to expect and I'm a bit uneasy about it, since I am a 120lb 5'5"" white gay male and I will have to take the redline back home around 130-2am 1 day per week, and it seems like there isn't really a bus service that compliments the red line late at night all the way to edgewater so I'm going to be stuck taking the red line.

In any event, I am a 6 minute walk from either the Thorndale or Granville station. For someone coming home at 1-2am on saturdays, which station is safest and what is my best route to avoid any gang activity or bad actors? It's such a quick walk but of course anything can happen between the red line and my home. I hate to ask another safety question in this subreddit but it's kind of sitting at the back of my mind, as someone who hasn't lived in Chicago before. I am feeling some slight regret on my decision(mostly because it's so far from everything) but would love some positive reinforcement from anyone who might live in the neighborhood.

Where can I find a 2 bedroom for under 150k? ,"Hi all,
About me. I am a single 35 year old woman who most likely won't be having kids. I make a nice salary working as a science teacher in China and honestly I just want a place to call home for the summer and my various holidays throughout the year. 

I plan to get a roommate who will take one room and I'll just be back about 2 months out of the year in the other room, so basically my roommate will get an entire apartment to herself for the price of a room.  And then I'll possibly move into it permanently but for now I just want to dip my toes.


I have a place in China but I def don't consider this place home and my family back in San Francisco is a bit much to be around and visiting them makes me tired.


I just want a 2 bedroom in an OK neighborhood. I have never been to Chicago but it has always been a dream of mine to live there. I will visit before buying but I wanted to ask here first about neighborhoods. Yes I have read all the post about neighborhoods.


BUT one thing I need to mention about me is....I am kinda okay with a neighborhood that is not the nicest, I don't want to blow my money for comfort, I just need a livable place that isn't in the most dangerous area but also I don't need the best neighborhood either. I see A LOT of houses and apartments for under 150k and they all look lovely but I am probably missing something.


A lot of people in S.F might disagree with me but, there is not a single neighborhood in S.F that I would deem unsafe for myself to live in (A family with kids might have a different take, naturally) whereas I hear people from S.F  mentioning the bad neighborhoods, yes, there are bad neighborhoods that aren't a recommended place for people to live but at the same time, I would be ok there personally but maybe I just a more into the thrill than others.


So, I am basically here not to ask which neighborhoods you recommend (I mean, that would be great too though!) but more of what neighborhoods you would say are ABOSULETY off limits. I think that will help me make a more informed decision and then I can check them all out when I visit.

Repatriating After 15 Years Abroad- With Korean Husband - Where and How to Start?,"Hi All,

Thanks for your advice and opinions on my lengthy post. VERY LONG LONG LONG POST AHEAD.

I’m American, previously lived in Midtown Atlanta in my 20s before moving to Seoul 15 years ago. My husband and I (married 1.5 years, together 8) are getting his spouse visa approved now and will be done and moving end of March 2026. I’m 41, he’s 34.

We have chosen your fine city after a lot of research and comparison shopping haha. My husband wants us to go somewhere totally new for both of us and start off on equal footing in a new place together. 

We love the cold weather (so does our Shiba), like the idea of living in the gayborhood (Lake View or Lake View East). My husband doesn’t drive so there’s excellent transit, close to the lake for our dog, and nightlife. 

We plan to visit in October this year to scope out some neighborhoods. 

Based on our research - it seems that Lakeview, Andersonville, and Wicker Park are the best areas overall for us? We def like to have nightlife options around. Don’t wannna be totally quiet. 

We live in Gangnam here now, and we don’t need the high rises and office crowds lol enough of that here.

The rental process - it seems that in Lakeview, most apartments are smaller low rise buildings run by property management companies. Any of them particularly good? I’ve done a search and seen the ones to avoid haha.

We will have cash ready for one year or slightly less rent up front - and I have credit hovering around 800.

Jobs for ME - I have a marketing background, but that was 15 years ago. I did create three of my business here, though. 

REAL ESTATE AGENTS - I’m considering doing my studies now so I can take the test when I arrive and have a skill ready to roll. Anyone here have any advice about that job market??

Any local job sites to recommend? I’m so far out of that loop lol. Able to start now that our interview is coming for sure. I’m planning on looking for service jobs as well for immediate cash and I can still teach online.

***Has anyone else been in our shoes? Big move and immigration to Chicago?***

I know this post seems kind of general, but just ready to get the ball rolling and start putting feelers out and hopefully connect with some of you!

Potentially moving to Chicago; what neighborhoods should we look into?,"Hello Chicagoans! Hopefully this sort of post is allowed; I figured it would be better to ask actual people instead of ChatGPT.

My wife and I are originally from the midwest (Kansas City area and rural MO), but we currently live in Sacramento California as my wife works on her PhD. She is just about one year away from finishing, and once she is done we are looking to move back to the midwest as our friends and family are still there. We have lived in Midtown Sacramento for about two years now, and we really like living in the city as two 30yo with no kids. We are exploring Chicago as the next place to call home once we leave California, among other cities. Currently, due to the size of the city and how much it has to offer, Chicago is our top choice of midwestern cities to move to. 

If you would indulge me, I was hoping to explain a few things we either like about living in Midtown currently or would like in our next neighborhood, and then have actual Chicagoans suggest neighborhoods for us to look into - or suggestions of neighborhoods to avoid. We are visiting Chicago twice this year; once during early August for a conference my wife is attending, and once again in mid-Sept for a friend’s wedding. We are hoping to spend some time in the city, scoping out potential future neighborhoods. We need to narrow down our search though, so that’s where y’all come in. Even if all of our bullet points below can’t be checked by any single neighborhood, any recommendations would be appreciated! 

**What we’re looking for:**

* **Green space/trees:** Sacramento is a very green city, with trees running down many streets. Although there are not a lot of parks, the amount of green you see when driving/walking through the city is really nice, so we’d love to live somewhere with similar feeling streets and/or lots of nearby parks. We don’t have a dog currently but we are planning to get one once we leave California.
* **Walkability:** this one probably doesn’t really narrow the list down much, but we love being just a 15-minute walk from cafes, grocery stores, restaurants, bookstores, pharmacies, and more. Bonus points for nearby farmer’s market; each Saturday morning we walk to the Midtown farmer’s market and enjoy the sites and smells while picking up some produce for the week. 
* **Low to Mid-rise living:** we currently live on the top floor of a five story building, but my wife doesn’t want to be any higher. We would like to own a house one day, but we will probably be renting for a bit as well. Not sure what our salaries will look like once we move, but we currently live in a 1150 sq ft 2b/2ba apartment with garage parking &amp; and in-unit laundry for about $2800/month.
* **Activity but not too loud or too late:** One of the things we dislike about our area is how close we are to the dive bars and nightclubs. We love a good cocktail bar and wine bar, but we have outgrown the nightclub scene. Currently, we can hear the music from nearby nightclubs until 2am. We would like to live somewhere with activity but not anything too loud and too late. 

**Other quick hits:**

* Being close-ish to the lake would be great but not a deal-breaker.
* As mentioned above, we don’t have kids and don’t plan to, so schools aren’t important to us

Thanks for reading and for any suggestions you may have. I doubt we are able to check every box listed above, but I appreciate you taking the time to give me your recommendations!

"Coming to Chicago, have some questions","Hi people of Chicago,

I posted this in the regular Chicago subreddit but i guess it's more suitable here.

I'm coming to visit your town in November for a conference (KubeCon) and i have been doing some research on what to see and do while there. Have found a few interesting sites and such but i hope you could provide some more hints and tips for me :-)

I will be mostly in central Chicago since the conference is at McCormick Place and my hotel is in the South Loop area. I have around 3 days for doing touristy stuff.

* What sights and places should i not miss ? I plan to see the area around DuSable Bridge and the parks south of Randolph St. Willis Tower is probably something i will go up in and the Museum of Science and Industry is on the list. Maybe the Art Institute as well. Anything else ?
* Since i like sports i managed to get a ticket to see the Blackhawks play New Jersey Devils in United Center. How far in advance is recommended to be at the arena ? What's there to see around United Center ? What's the best way of getting there and back ? I would assume the traffic situation could could be problematic when everyone leaves the arena...
* I have also planned to do some shopping. Mostly clothes probably so any recommended places in the central parts ? If there are any great places further away there's always Uber and such. I prefer outlets if possible since the exchange rate for dollars right now isn't in my favor at all.... In my previous visits to the US i have always liked Ross and i know there is one on W Randolph Street.
* Any good restaurants i should visit ? Or bars that serve craft beer (locally brewed)?
* Any particular areas and similar to avoid other than being generally cautious ?

I appreciate every answer :-)",AskChicago,8,1697381497.0,49,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/178h17m/coming_to_chicago_have_some_questions/

Where to live for young family: South Loop or Hyde Park?,"Hello,

I am moving to Chicago with my wife and nearly.4 year old son. We are Canadian. My wife and I are medical trainees and will both be working at UChicago Medical Center for 2 years.

\-I was wondering what would be the safest area to live in. I keep hearing that you need to avoid the South end of Chicago. Where is that exactly?

\-We were interested in Hyde Park because it's close to the hospital and it looks nice, almost suburban, and the rent is cheaper. But we have heard some anecdotes that it's close to some shady areas.

\-South Loop seems to be a popular area for medical residents, but it is expensive and somewhat urban looking. However, we did find a nice school there for our son and some nice apartments/townhouses.

We are probably leaning toward South Loop because it seems safer, which is really our priority, but I was just hoping to have some insight from locals.

Thank you.

EDIT: Thank you all for your input. Hyde Park sounds like the winner for young families. The only problem is that we've been having trouble finding a school that can readily accept him there. Many are private schools with long admissions processes and long waiting lists. We will look in to it some more though.

Chicago neighborhoods with bicycle infrastructure,"My wife and I are planning on moving into the city in March, and we've found some potential apartments, but there is one thing that I'm worried about; biking around the city. We are from Japan and riding bikes around where we lived was relatively easy and safe. But riding bikes in Chicago seems to be a lot more challenging. While there are some bike lanes, most of them are unprotected with a small strip in between the main road cars and other cars making right turns.  I tried driving in the city to get an idea of the driving habits of people, and honestly from the things I've witnessed, I'm so worried about the safety of my wife if she decides to ride a bike.

It seems like cars don't obey any of the rules. Even today, I had to go into the city, and while waiting at a red light, a car literally made a left turn on red and almost hit a pedestrian crossing the street.The area we are considering is between the south and west loop, near Lasalle Street. By bike, there are a couple of grocery stores only 5-10 minutes away, but walking takes about 20 minutes.

The issue is the area doesn't have bike lines. In Chicago, I know it's illegal to ride on sidewalks, but riding in the street seems even more dangerous.Do you have any recommendations for places to live in the city that have safer infrastructure for bikes?We are open to any part of Chicago as long as it's safe, however, we would like to be close to some grocery markets (Target, Trader Joe's, etc). We also found an Asian market called Gangnam Market, and she likes that grocery store since it has most of the ingredients we need for cooking.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You :)

&amp;#x200B;

Update: 1/9/24

I wanted to say thank you to everyone who responded to my post. My wife and I were really surprised by how many people were willing to help us. We stayed up late researching additional places in Logan Square, Wicker Park, Bucktown, and Lincoln Park.

From the places we saw online and a combination of Google Maps, the Logan Square/Wicker Park area has a nice homey feel, along with some nice bike lanes. Plus it's pretty close Joong Boo and Gangnam Market by bike and train. Gonna scout the area over the weekend to get a better feel of the area.

We realize that Chicago will not come close to what we are used to in Japan, but finding a middle ground is good enough for us.",AskChicago,44,1704766989.0,36,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1923fqj/chicago_neighborhoods_with_bicycle_infrastructure/
Walkable Neighborhoods for a Young Family?,"Hi all,

My wife (27) and I (31) are looking to move to Chicago in the next year. We're planning a two-week trip by the end of the year to Chicago in various neighborhoods to get a feel for what it's like living there. Somewhere with great walkability with easy access to parks and transit. We're coming from a suburban area, and getting a bit tired of the sprawl and a heavy reliance on a car, so we're very likely to sell one of our two cars.

1. **Budget:** $500K-$600K
2. **Size:** &lt;2,000 sq ft
3. **Bedrooms:** At least 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms
4. **Family:** No kids, but we plan to have one or two soonish. We have one small puppy.
5. **Wants:** Easy access to parks, transit, and walkable. Preferably a house or condo - avoiding apartments.

Thoughts on Skinner West/West Loop and Blaine Elementary for child potentially needing special education/therapy?,"My husband and I are thinking about moving from Hudson Valley to Chicago with our 5 month old. He was diagnosed with Sturge-Weber Syndrome and we’d love to live close(ish) the Lure Children’s Hospital where they have a Sturge-Weber Center. This way he can see his doctors without disrupting his school day too much. As of right now, we are considering two areas: 

West Loop: very close to the hospital and has Skinner West which has a number of “schools with a school” and a special needs school in the neighborhood should he need it. 

Blaine Elementary: great school that we have heard is very community-oriented. That said, if a cubs game is going on I am worried traffic will turn the 18 min one way drive to the hospital into a 30+ minutes.

I would love to hear honest thoughts on the schools and their neighborhoods, also open to hearing about other schools/areas! Just want to note that we want to avoid private school to allow us to really invest in his medical needs, extracurriculars, therapies, etc. ",AskChicago,2,1732902570.0,20,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1h2rej1/thoughts_on_skinner_westwest_loop_and_blaine/
Does Anyone Know of an Organization or Church That Could Use a Donation of Action Figures for Boys Ages 6-11?,"Hi everyone,

I recently volunteered with an organization on Halloween that received a large toy donation, specifically action figures for boys ages 6-11. However, they don’t have enough storage space, so they’re giving them away for free. I offered to help find an organization or church that could make use of them.

If you know of any groups, nonprofits, or churches that would benefit from this donation, please let me know! The toys are all the same type, so a place that serves a larger group of kids might be ideal. The pickup location is in the Uptown area.

I'm not mentioning the organization's name here to avoid overwhelming them with direct requests, but I’d be happy to share more details if you’re connected to a relevant organization or church.

Is the Pace 603 route then transfer to the Blue Line at Rosemont the best way to commute from the Elgin/Hoffman Estates area to downtown?,"I'll be moving back to Chicago after some time away in a little bit, but I'll be staying out in the Elgin/Hoffman Estates area for the summer and working at a place downtown on the Blue Line. It'll be a brutal commute no matter what, but thankfully temporary. I originally figured I'd just take the Pace 603 bus route to Rosemont and take the Blue Line downtown (near UIC, if that changes anything) to avoid paying so much extra for the Metra (I will have to take CTA no matter what, so I'm definitely getting a CTA monthly pass, but the Metra pass would be an extra $135 on top of that). I had two questions about this; since I haven't been in the city in a while I wanted to know if anybody knew of a better/faster way to get there, though I expect a no on that. MDW and Pace-Blue Line are the only really feasible ways I know of.

Also, I've heard from a friend of mine who does a similar commute every day and takes the Metra that the Blue Line's been very sketchy lately, and it might be worth it to take Metra instead, essentially ""paying for safety"". I thought I would be fine since the northern leg of the Blue Line tends to be safe, being so close to O'Hare and being used mostly by people getting to and from the airport. I've also heard that the 603 route for Pace is one of the most reliable ones, though I've never taken it myself. Maybe things have changed since I was last in the city though? I just wanted to ask here to get some more opinions. I'd be taking this route at around 7am-9am in the morning and maybe 5pm-7pm at night. I think it also helps that this is only for the summer so I'll always have daylight during my commute.

Best way to get from Norwood Park to Metro?,"I live in the Norwood Park area, but not particularly close to transit, so I usually drive and park closer to the train when I go into the city for anything. Generally I park near and use the blue line. Going to Metro soon for a show, but transit sends me to the loop to transfer to the red line and it seems like a lot of excess travel. Last time I went to Metro I tried driving and parking near the red line north of the area but it was way too congested and crazy so I ended up driving to Metro and parking, but that's a huge pain in the ass so I want to avoid it.

Why is flying from/to Chicago so expensive?,"So I have been a couple of years in Chicago and I have friends and coworkers in LA, New York and other smaller cities. Every time we are planning a trip to wherever in the country or the world, flights are more expensive from Chicago and I can not understand why. I know prices fluctuate but it is always the same thing, every single time. It does not matter if we book last minute or months in advance. Chicago is always more expensive.

Eg: We need to go to Washington DC for work in a couple of weeks. Flights from Chicago 174 USD per way vs 89 from New York and 149 from LAX. It is even cheaper to do almost 5 hours from LAX than 2 hours from ORD. Same airlines btw, no low cost or anything just United, American and Delta.

And while we are at it if I can ask something non Chicago exclusive. Why are the prices almost identical for all airlines at all times? Everywhere in the world prices are different from one airline to another and also differ relatively to the flight time, if you take a night flight or a morning flight etc. Here somehow all prices are almost identical. The day I am looking at there are like 20 flights and all of them are price the same. Seems like price fixing to me pretty anti capitalistic and free economy etc. Competition tends to lean to better prices for the user but somehow here if one goes up all the rest go to :S

* Open to **high-rises or charming older buildings** – as long as it's well-maintained
* Ideally want a quieter, residential feel but with quick access to everything

"Do you know anything about Llewellyn Court in Midlothian, Illinois?","Hello and Salutations, oh ye Random Readers of Reddit!

I do hope this is a suitable subreddit for this query. If not, I would greatly appreciate any advice on where this post would gain more traction.

So, to set the scene: it's the beginning of the century, around '02 or '03, and I was a sophomore or junior in high school.  At the time, I was working at the Midlothian Country Club and had just gotten done for the day.  I was within walking distance from home (and poor with no wheels of my own besides a bicycle from many years prior to that day), so I walked home.  

The usual route home was a dangerous one:  a hazardous walk that led along a windy, bind-corner-having, narrow road where I was all but guaranteed to be struck by a car if I wasn't paying attention.  It was an older, richer neighborhood that was built back when most people didn't have cars, so the roads didn't need to be wide, IDK.

Also, I had on me the final remnants of a dime bag of some reggies that I wanted to smoke before I got home.  The weed was not mind-blowing quality, mind you dear readers, as I was still a poor high schooler.  This is important to note as I wholly and fully retained my mental faculties throughout the entirety of my escapade.  Where my mind went to, along with my body, is at the center of my question, but I digress.

So, wanting to finish my smokes, and not get hit  by a car (or seen smoking as it was still not recreational at the time) in the process, I opted for the woods that where geographically located between the CC and my home.  

It was a bright and sunny summer day, not too hot, but still hot enough for me to seek the succor of the trees and the abundant shade they offered.  I felt fairly confident I'm my internal compass and knew the general direct I needed to travel in order to reach my destination of my usual after work snack: 7up and Cheetos.  

I walked until I was out of sight from the winding road and got the baggy out.  I pulled out my lighter and then the pop can from my lunch earlier.  I know, I know, don't smoke from aluminum, it's hazardous to your health.  But this was many many moons ago, so forgive the poor poor high school student that needed to smoke a bowl without having an actual bowl.  Joint papers, you say?  Let's not have that argument, okay?

Leaning up against a tree, I carefully flattened the can and then indented it to create the bowl.  As I poked the holes with a pin, I took in the gentle beauty of the forest around me.  The sunlight dappled through the leaves that shook with the faint wind.  Without the heaviness of the heat, it was an ideal time and I was enjoying being outside and technically in suburbia, but not surrounded by people.  A few squirrels and some birds went about their daily business plotting to overthrow humanity, but I was the only human around.

I finished breaking down the green and placing it over the pinholes.  With no further delay, I sparked the pile of ground bud and inhaled deeply.  Because of my combination of asthma, the weed, and the aluminum my coughing fit was enough to disturb the locals and scare them away.  Smiling and unperturbed, I continued on in what I believed was the direction home, taking the occasional break and hit.  

I had just burned the last of my green into total white and grey, crushed the pile of ash, and concluded there was nothing left to smoke.  Saddened slightly by this inevitability, I blew the ash off the can, and stuck it and the lighter in my pocket.  Another bit of coughing to clear the lung butter out and I was ready to continue on my way.  However, this is the precise moment in which I found myself in my own episode of the Twilight Zone.  

There was nothing sinister or evil about the stage, it was just there, in front of me.  Out there in the woods, it was maybe just a bit lonely-looking.  But it was there, and I was there, and I had no idea where ""There"" was.  The same forest still appeared to surround me: deciduous trees and a light undergrowth of random flowers.  I knew that I had to be in Illinois, not far from home.  But, looking back on it now, those woods could have been almost anywhere on the planet.  

The stage was made of bricks: painfully ordinary red shades of brick, stacked in typical brick fashion.  It wasn't very large, but it was big enough for a band to set up on.  Or maybe a small theater troupe.  There was a back wall, but I do not remember it having a roof.  It was of a simple design that was wholly unremarkable, aside from the fact that it was here amongst these trees and I felt like it should not have been.  It was clearly abandoned, but not decrepit or in disrepair.  The concrete slab that served as the stage floor was solid and not damaged or cracked.  In fact, it reminded me a lot of other small town community stages I had come across.  But those where always in some community park or somewhere accessible, not sitting in the middle of the friggin woods.

The only real detail the stage had that made it unique was the nameplate that was centered in the front of the bricks, the name stamped or carved into the concrete:  Llewellyn Court.  I remember the name because:

A) it's the name of this weird stage in the middle of the woods.  A stage that showed no real reason for being left to the wills of the wild.  A stage that, curiously enough, sported no graffiti or signs of youthful shit-heads leaving there marks behind.

B) I was, and still am, an avid fan of the James Bond movies.  Especially the older ones with Desmond Llewellyn as Q.  It's an odd, Welsh name on a stage in the middle of the woods in Midlothian, Illinois.  That kind of things sticks with you.

Now, back to the story.  I'm afraid that I don't remember much else because I left the area abruptly.  I knew I needed to get home and do chores, and I was a bit high and the munchies where setting in as the siren call of 7up and Cheetos echoed in my stomach.  I resolved, however, to return at a more opportune time and explore the Court more.  I hurried away from the area, not because I felt threatened or scared, but because I felt like I just should not be there.  It was a bit sad, to be honest, this seemingly well-built stage that at one time showcased the entertainment of a community, now relegated to be reclaimed by nature.

And, like all faintly fairie tales, I did return to the woods, but I was unable to find the stage again.  Try as I may, I was never present in Llewellyn Court again.  I did ask at the town hall if there were records of the stage, but the kindly matron had no information for me.  Occasionally I will do a Google search, but likewise yield no fruitful  results.

So that is my question to the unlimited reaches of the Internet and Reddit in general: Do you know anything about Llewellyn Court in Midlothian, Illinois?",AskChicago,0,1728819980.0,12,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1g2nuak/do_you_know_anything_about_llewellyn_court_in/

I'm more of an artsy person but I'm also a foodie so I settled here.

It's the most strangely homogenous place I've lived in terms of the people, almost like a reality TV show picked contestents based on specific behaviors and plopped them all in one place. It's like the truman show, where everyone are actors saying the same things the same way.

1. Mid twenties/early thirties men with slick back haircuts wearing white shoes, those tight fitting shorts, almost like they all work at a boathouse in lake geneva or something. Everytime I hear a conversation it's always about ""some big deal I'm working through"".  I go to the huxton hotel occasionally to grab a drink and 50% of the time there is a solo guy that walks up to the bar in a suit, slicked back hair,  in a hurried/stressed demeanor with his airpods in talking about investing in some property or business while simultaneously ordering a whiskey.
2. Every woman looks and behaves the same. tiny dog check. walking around in casual yoga outfit check. never will they ever make eye contact, ever. The weirdest thing I constantly see is the pilates classes. I Walk by and its like 60 women that look IDENTICAL doing IDENTICAL WORKOUTS with IDENTICAL OUFTITs. I swear it can pass as some kind of facility pumping out fem-robots for mass deployment and they are all calibrating their mechanical joints or some shit like that.

Did I pick the wrong weekend to visit?,"So I planned an impromptu mom/teenage son overnight trip for this weekend, having never been to Chicago. I thought it would be cool for us to hop on a plane and head somewhere we’d never been on the last weekend before his senior year. Well, he backed out and I’d accidentally booked a nonrefundable room. I’ll be arriving early tomorrow morning, alone. Relying on public transport only. Leaving late afternoon Sunday.

I didn’t know about the air/water show until yesterday and now I see why the damned room was so expensive. My initial plan for us had been to hit a couple of museums, get a wet Italian beef sandwich, maybe pop in a record store. Now I’m kinda bummed and can’t believe I picked this weekend to visit for the first time, but I have to make the best of it. Not big on huge crowds, but I can deal. Not bringing any nice clothes, just a backpack with a packing cube and essentials, so I don’t plan to go anyplace where I’d wanna look overly presentable, if you know what I mean. I know it’s gonna be hot as balls.

My question: Will the air/water show pull crowds from other activities like the architectural tour, museums, and other standard fare? I’m staying right down in the thick of it. I realize it’s gonna get LOUD and probably pretty surreal. If nothing else, it should make for a great story to tell.

All suggestions welcome. Thanks!

Re: Am I going to freeze to death visiting this weekend?,"Hey all! Wanted to follow up and say thanks to all those who helped me plan and warn us about our first trip to Chicago despite the cold weather. Wanted to post what we did and how we managed:

Friday: leggings/tights and jeans on bottom with a sweater and puffer and beanie on top. We planned to most of our walking today. 

Walked to do rite for breakfast and grabbed a breakfast sammie and their seasonal donuts (gingerbread and peppermint). You need to get the gingerbread ASAP.

Walked Mag Mile from the roastery down to Millennium Park and just walked around some blocks and hotels before our reservation at Cindy's. Got the burger, so good. Then did some ice skating and did the Christmas market. Got some gingerbread cookies and got coco and walked back to the hotel to decompress and power nap before we went to the zoo lights but didn't end up going because we were pooped. Stayed in and walked by Eataly for a quick bite

Saturday: leggings/tights under joggers with our waterproof/hiking pants on, added a balaclava on top.

Yeah it's getting cold. Balaclavas all day. 

Walked to Beatrix for breakfast and yeah, totally rocks. Wife did the avo toast and we shared the lemon pancakes. Walked the top 1/3 of mag mile, checked out the Lego store and the malls to warm up. Walked back downtown for our walking tour at the trade building. Did an interior design walking tour with Tours with Mike and it was awesome. Everything was Christmas'ed out! 

After the tour we took the red line to Portillo's in River North. We're from SW Ohio so chilli dogs are our thing and it was so good (despite having beans on it) and the cake shake is otherworldly. Went back to the hotel for a couple hours to relax. Went to Pequod's for dinner (yumm!) and ended the night at the Music Box Theatre for their Christmas sing a long and It's a Wonderful Life. Walking around this area back to the bus was definitely the coldest portion of the trip at like midnight. Wife broke out the hand warmers. Took the L back to the hotel and passed out at 1am.

Sunday: Door dashed Ann Sathers (so good!) to the hotel, packed up, stopped by MSI for the Christmas tree exhibit and headed home. 

We had a great trip and despite the cold manged to get a couple miles in! I'd never taken public transit before so that was cool. The busses and the red line was super nice and clean. The most hazardous part of the trip was the Indiana highway. Not the snow. Just their roads 😅

I easily got around the city without feeling overstimulated 24/7.

I spent the day here on Sunday and Monday and honestly, the cooler weather didn’t bother me (thankfully I came prepared). However, I know living here is a completely different story, especially during the winter. 

I’m considering moving in the next year or so and would love to hear from anyone that moved from the south/warmer climate. How was it adjusting to the cold? Really it’s the only thing that could discourage me.

I definitely prefer the cold over the heat. The summers in New Orleans are brutal. I hate walking outside and immediately feeling like I’m unable to breathe. If you’ve been here, you know what I mean.

How to get to O'Hare at 3:00 AM?,"I'm on one of the first flights out of O'Hare tomorrow morning, meaning that I want to be at the airport by around 3:30 AM. I live in Uptown so O'Hare isn't exactly easy for me to get to using public transit regardless of what time it is. I have a few options, the first being do a pretty expensive Uber. I looked into scheduling one just now and it was about $45 (Lyft was $70?!) Another option is take the Red Line down to the Loop and transfer to Blue Line. This would take about an hour, which I don't mind at all, but the time of night is scaring me. I'm a female and will be alone. I've been on the both the Red and Blue after midnight a few times and while nothing has happened, I still did not feel the safest about it. Maybe if I just had to take the Blue straight up it would be better but I will also probably have wait times on the platforms (transfering at Lake) due to the time I'm leaving. I also dont't want to rely on buses to take me to the Blue Line as I would have to transfer twice and feel that's pretty unreliable. Should I suck it up and take the train? Or is there a better chance that my Uber will not be that expensive if I order when I'm ready to leave? I don't take Uber that often. What about calling a taxi service?",AskChicago,65,1758895176.0,197,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1nr23q2/how_to_get_to_ohare_at_300_am/
No drinks = no hospitality ,"So so sick of this happening and wondering if this happens to anyone else / if anyone has suggestions on how to make the situation better. Me and my girlfriend (25&amp;26) love going out to restaurants but we tend to get really awful service and it’s like they follow the same script every time. Waiter will come over happy and as friendly as can be and ask “can I start you off with any drinks?” often when going out for dinner we don’t also have drinks but as soon as I say we are going to stick with waters you can see the waiters face completely change. 

Example 1. Very nice pizza place. We were sat and the waiter came up and asked if we wanted drinks and I said we are going to stick to water (as it was 845 on a Wednesday night) and immediately said “k. I’ll be back later” and then disappeared for almost a half hour before we could order food and when taking our food order he pushed drinks 5 times…. Didn’t fill up our waters the entire meal and had to flag down a different waiter to get a box and check. 

Example 2. River north semi casual place. Went in for dinner with a couple friends after walking the city the entire day and we were all dead tired and just really wanted water. Waiter came up super nice asked about drinks and when we said no got super annoyed at us. Can back with a water pitcher and slammed it down on the table. Came back for orders and said “what do you want?” We ended up ordering apps entrée and dessert but he would just very clearly upsetly throw our plates down. 

I get that if we don’t get drinks the tip in theory will be less but what… if we get a round of drinks for $36 x .20 = $7.20tip. Like if we get awful service you are going to lose a lot more than 7 bucks in tips so if it mattered that much why not be nice! 

Guess this is more of a rant but it’s the one thing I don’t like about living here. 7/10 times we get HORRIBLE service all because don’t get drinks. The places that are still nice we visit really often. Also I’m partially assuming no drinks combined with the fact we look young is an issue. It’s just disheartening when you can see the look on the waiters face change :(

Edit: I am so glad to hear we are an outlier here. I think there are many factors related to us and exterior factors and we just (wrongly) assumed it was due to drinks bc we definitely had that happen once or twice before. Also where we end up choosing to go seems to have a lot to do with it. ",AskChicago,206,1723724256.0,418,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1estofb/no_drinks_no_hospitality/
How are single 30 and up ladies making friends around here?,"I’m 36, single and childless. I technically live in Oak Park but I’m always down for an excuse to go into the city. I’m looking to make some other lady friends who like to watch trash tv, throw/attend a themed party, and don’t mind getting into deep convos about books/art/life now and then. 

I feel like being this age without kids makes it impossible to find people like me who might actually be free for a glass of wine on a Tuesday night. 

Are we all hanging out at a secret 32 and up wine bar? I’m not much of a crafter and every book club I’ve seen leans towards much older women (which is fine! Just looking for peers in my age group too). I also love watching sports (Blackhawks!!!) but not playing them.

Any places, tips, tricks, groups/clubs would be great. Going to things alone and just trying to reach out to people is getting really tiresome. 

Thanks!!! 

EDIT - HOLY SMOKES! Here I thought I was alone in needing friends but look at us! Aren’t we a friendly albeit slightly lonely bunch?! We’re out there! I promise I’ll get to all the messages and stay tuned so if people are interested in some meet ups maybe we can make that happen.

"My HOA board is moving forward with a huge special assessment, despite vocal complaints from owners and no visible support. What would you do?","Ok, here’s the scoop, I am facing a special assessment of approximately $35,000 (for one unit and a parking space). This isn’t a luxury apartment, my spouse and I are both work upper/middle class jobs and could afford this apt on our salaries.

The reason for the special assessment is three fold (1) The reserves are laughably low for a building of our size, thanks old board (2) The roof is 20 years old (3) The elevators are no longer reliable.

The board has decided the roof classifies as an emergency situation, so legally they can move forward without the consent of the owners. They have decided to do a full removal of the roof instead of installing a new roof on top of the old one. Removing the roof is the higher quality option, but is the reason our special assessment is so high. Based on research done by another tenant who does roofing project management for other buildings, we could be going with the less quality, but still 20 year warranty roof and our assessment would be cut by approximately $10k each unit.

Further, the special assessment is padded so the extra funds will go to build up the reserves of the building.

We have had 2 HOA meetings where owners had the opportunity to speak (but not vote). Despite several people asking for further investigation, the board moved forward with their plan, and made no alterations to their plan. People in this meeting brought up alternatives, asked our roofing specialist when a repair would be a better option (and our situation seems to qualify), and some owners pointed out that due to this special assessment, they are delaying their weddings and others said this has influenced them to stop trying to have their first child.

This is clearly a crappy situation. We do need to get the roof fixed and we need operating elevators; however, the way the board has unilaterally moved forward does not sit right with many of the owners. 

What would be your course of action?

Additional question: if a roof can be roofed over twice, is it customary to start fresh if it is still the first layer? I saw that weight is a contributing factor and condition of the roof. Anything else I should ask to help me understand the choice? As a previous stand alone home owner, I’m frustrated with the lack of autonomy and information.

Edit to add: we purchased a year ago, the roof was inspected and came back without any major issues, we did point out the low reserves and have $$$ from the former owner as an escrow for this very issue. So in reality, myself and my unit are going to be fine. What doesn’t sit well is the unilateral decision making and the lack of information that the board has provided us with throughout the process. For example, last night was the first time we had the chance to explore the option of a recover. This has definitely taught me it’s time to run for the board the next time elections come up! I was hoping for a few years to settle in, but oh well!

Also, it is nice to hear the perspectives coming in. It’s helping me stay a little grounded in a frustrating situation.

Edit to add:
There are payment plans in the works, no word yet on exact details.

Edit to add:
I have attended every HOA meeting, while it was stated that the roof was being inspected, it was not disclosed that the situation was elevated to emergency status in the general session. That happened in an executive meeting, behind closed doors, and shortly after we received a 3 paragraph letter informing us of the special assessment. When owners asked for additional information or meetings with the board, they were denied. When owners asked for meetings to be recorded due to scheduling conflicts, the board refused. When we meet on zoom, the chat is turned off now. We are given exactly 48 hours heads up about board meetings, one of which occurred in the middle of a work day.",AskChicago,91,1753453893.0,173,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1m90q0g/my_hoa_board_is_moving_forward_with_a_huge/

How to love Chicago when you're new and lonely?,"I'm 24M and just moved to Chicago a few weeks ago, and I love the city. There is so much to do, but it's a bit depressing, because I have no one to do these things with. I've been eating at new restaurants alone. I wore a nice outfit and went out tonight - went to a bar by myself, and then went to Logan Square emporium and played some games, but I sucked at all of them. I wish I had someone to laugh about it with, but I didn't, so I kind of just felt like a loser. It got boring pretty quick...I wish I could've just given all my extra tokens to somebody else. Then I just walked home.

I've gone to one event so far I guess - I tried really hard to be extroverted and I got a bunch of contacts - but it seems no one is actually interested in seriously keeping touch or meeting up. I've been trying dating apps but I get maybe 1-2 matches a week, and it usually never leads anywhere.

I'm a pretty good looking guy I think and I have a lot to offer - but I worry being in a city that is so eventful is going to make me feel really depressed. But then again, I've never done well in the friends department regardless of what city I'm in.

Best steakhouse for romantic date night in Chicago?,"Hello, 

My husband and I have been married for almost 17 years, and this year for Valentine's Day I really want to do something special/romantic. We have 3 children, and usually don't get to do anything for Valentine's Day alone. So, we usually have pizza Hut and cheesecake factory with the kids. But, this year, we get to do something!! And I'm very excited 😊 

Anyways, I really want to check out a steakhouse in Chicago, that is also romantic. My husband and I LOVE steak. But, the last time we went out for steak, it was so disappointing. It was a St. Elmo's affiliate restaurant in Fishers, Indiana. And omg, the steak was not good. It definitely tasted like it came from a sealed package and had fake grill marks on it. 

Does anyone have a recommendation on a very nice/romantic/delicious steakhouse in Chicago? I want to make our 17th anniversary special. And it will be nice to have a romantic date night with just my husband.

Do women in Chicago want to be approached out and about in the city,"Some background: had low success on dating apps so pre pandemic (2016-2019) I used to go out to bars and meet women irl. Got a girlfriend from that. Moved to Europe for 3 years, got into fitness and then stopped going out until late night and just started meeting women via friends or in parties.

Most European cities are walkable, people are friendlier and if I was out with friends and saw someone we would be interested in, we would strike up a conversation, talk and then ask them out or invite to our parties. We always got positive feedback.

I also lived in NYC so I know people here are much friendlier but lately I have been seeing a lot of posts by women who are exhausted and burned out by dating apps. I asked my friend if he would be down to just meet other women if we go out for brunch or for shopping and see someone cute and he said most women don't want to be bothered when they are out and it will come out as creepy, hitting on women if they are going back from work or just want to shop by themselves.

I am old school 31M and don't like dating apps. Prefer meeting irl and I am morning person, hate going to clubs and bars so meeting at night time is out of the question. I wanted to know from the women in this subreddit if they are open to being approached if they are out shopping or walking back from work or out with friends. A lot of women walking in the city are always wearing headphones so that also makes me hesitant so just looking for an honest feedback.

Also for women who do want it, if you could give some positive pointers on how to do it without coming off like a weirdo that would be helpful.

"I’m 36F and single, should I move to Chicago without knowing anyone??","I’m 36F and single. I currently  live in a medium sized city where dating options are bleak. I also am having difficultly finding friends here who like to go out and do things. It seems that most people I meet are coupled up and just kind of want to stay at home and do their own thing on weekends. If someone is willing to go out with me it’s usually just a 1:1 dinner or drinks to catch up. That being said,  my entire immediate and extended family live here, and I do have a few friends here as well. 

I’ve loved Chicago every time I’ve visited. I’m thinking of moving there to expand my social and dating opportunities. However  if I move there I will know absolutely no one. How difficult will this realistically be to start a social life from scratch? I can potentially see things going well but I can also envision this going poorly and resulting in me spending a lot of time alone and depressed. I feel that finding friends was much easier in your 20s, and  that the sports leagues, run clubs, pickleball leagues, city girls who walk, and all of the other clubs/groups that are  typically mentioned will likely be full of people a decade younger than me. Has anyone been in this situation in their mid 30s and moved to Chicago without knowing anyone? How did it work out for you? Or does anyone who currently lives there want to tell me how they think this will go?? 

I work remotely which I know does not help. 

My other option would be to stay in my current city and just continue trying to meet new people, and be happy that I still have at least a few social connections here.

What area should I stay in if I’m going to a concert at Soldier Field?,"My friends and I (4 of us total) will be in Chicago for the first time in August for a concert. We’ll be flying into O’Hare and won’t have a car. I’m trying to get an idea of where we should stay and the best ways to get around.

Here are the two options I’m considering so far:

\-Option 1: Stay in a hotel near Soldier Field. We may have a little bit of a walk or have to Uber to the pedestrian bridge, but that shouldn’t be too big of a problem. My only concerns with this option are that we won’t have a shuttle to our hotel from the airport, so an Uber could get pricey, and the hotels in this area seem to cost about twice as much as hotels near the airport.

\-Option 2: Stay in a hotel near O’Hare (with a free airport shuttle) and then Uber or take public transit to get to Soldier Field. My concerns with this option are navigating public transit (I’m from a small town that doesn’t even have bus service) or Ubering from so far away. We are also going to the concert two nights in a row, so that would be a lot of back-and-forth.

There may also be some other options that I’m not even considering. So what would you all do? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Has anyone here had experience moving from Austin to Chicago? I'm curious to hear your pros/cons between the two cities -- especially around cost of living, weather, and meeting new people. I would be moving alone. Is Chicago a difficult place to make community as a 30 year old? I know some cities like Seattle have a reputation for being difficult to break into social circles.

And yes, I know it will be cold! Austin summers make me depressed so I'm (perhaps naively) expecting the Chicago weather to be a welcome change of pace.

Thanks!

Best place to live for night jogging?,"I’m moving to Chicago having lived in a pretty safe suburb all my life, and I really enjoy taking long walks and jogs at night.

How should I spend my 30th birthday?,"29F turning the big 3-0 the end of next month

Recently moved to Chicago from Colorado due to a work opportunity (but born and bred in the midwest), and tranparently, I mostly hate it here and miss CO very much, so I'm trying to priotitize myself for my birthday this year. I recognizine I'm the minority, but this is not the post to bash me for not loving Chicago. There are many wonderful things here, it's just not my forever home.

I happen to have the week of my birthday off work due to boss traveling, and just looking for something for myself. My partner already booked us a nice dinner.

\-Good eats, I'll eat anything!   
\-Art/DIY - I regularly sew, crochet, knit, paint, etc   
\-Thrifting/Antiquing   
\-I'm more of a THC gal, but my drink of choice is tequila or wine/bubblies

- Architecture River Cruise, Skyline Lake Cruise and the Riverwalk.
- Shedd, Field, Griffin, Art institute and Illusions museums. Adler doesn’t sound very interesting to me yet but if I dont have anything else I’m visiting that too.
- Flyover, Ferris Wheel, 360. I’ve heard sky deck and 360 are similar so I picked just one.
- Also general walks and shopping around chinatown, Lincoln park, Southport, Fulton, Magnificent Mile, Wicker Park and Bucktown.
- Also covering a buncha restaurants and cafe. Red Hot Ranch, Malnati, Birriera Zaragoza, 312, Superdawg, Jibarito, Johnnie’s Beef, Lawrence Fish Market, Hing Kee, First Sip, Wormhole, Daisies.

Have you ever seen anything like this?,"Has anyone ever seen something like this? - wanted to share a very odd incident I saw. So, around 10:10 pm last night, a friend and I were walking from dinner off of Bryn Mawr up Ridge. A white SUV is driving north on Ridge, slowly driving by. A man probably in his 20s hispanic, gets out of the SUV. Looks like a woman is driving the SUV and drops him off. This is probably 150 feet or so from the Walgreens and where we are walking.

At the Walgreens, an employee, a man also looking to be in his 20s white guy skinny is changing the garbage outside of the store. The employee was wearing a tail, I commented to my friend how odd that is, never have seen someone wearing a tail (like literally an animal big tail). We look forward the man in the hoody is about 50 feet away now is standing there and tightens his hoody so his face is less visible (hoody said Fear of God or something like that on it, no jacket). A little panic sets in just because he is doing that and right in front of us, like that's odd, a guy getting out of car and tigtening his hoody like that.

Well, he runs right by us and through the Walgreens parking lot, rips off the worker’s tail and just is booking it full speed. It was icy out too, so not the brightest it seems. In a few seconds it’s all over - he ripped the guy's tail off and was gone down an alley on other side of parking lot. The worker looks around and just yells something like ""what an asshole"" but the tail-ripper was already by the alley running off.

Friend and I look around but there's nobody like recording it or anything like that. Seems it was a legit attack and the speed of it was just kinda scary to say the least. Had that been someones purse, etc it would have been all over in a few seconds. I don't know we just can't get over how weird the whole thing was. Was it a test run to steal something else, did the guys have a beef we didn't know about, who knows... but yeah that really happened and it was super strange.",AskChicago,187,1741300083.0,62,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1j581mf/have_you_ever_seen_anything_like_this/

Chicago Review. First time visit. Unbiased opinion attempt,"I am from Washington State (not a WA native though. but lived here for ~~12 years now) in the north Seattle Area (about 15 miles north of the space needle to give a reference point)

I just landed back home yesterday after a weekend trip to Chicago.

I unfortunately did not have as much time as i wanted there. and couldnt do everything that was on my list. I also had to rush alot of things because I was running out of time.

lastly, i mostly were in the (i hope i dont get the areas wrong. referencing google maps) Mag Mile, South Loop, West loop area. so my review will primarily be based on those places. so in general, it might not be a representation of chicago.

I dont go down to Seattle often, so my comparison might be incorrect. and again, this is based on the areas i was staying at while in Chicago. so PLEASE point out anything for me that may make my observations different. (either for chicago, or seattle)

So first of all, the location and area.

Domestically, this is my first time going any past the West Coast. The vibe around here is so very chill but also very obviously different compared to Seattle. My only understanding of Chicago is whats portrayed in the movies and TV. But my time there, i only saw 1 homeless person. The area and streets were very clean. and all throughout the day and night, there were alot of activity but still fairly quiet!

The vibe was amazing. I saw so many people wearing really nice clothes. Both men and women. but especially women. Alot of them had very nice looking dresses. it was as if they were going to the Gala, or a formal/semi formal dinner. Even when i was walking around W ohio st &amp; N wells st. There were so many people dressed nicely.

I RARELY see that in Seattle (if ever actually).

Also while walking around, there were so many nice looking restaurants that were also bustling. the atmosphere and vibe also looked and appeared great! many outdoor seating. dim lighting, great mood, etc.

Food

this is one of my regrets. I didnt have enough time to try out as much as i can. I also cant eat as much as I used to be able to when i was younger. The places I visited were

* Au Cheval

* Small Cheval

* Al's Beef for Chicago Dog and Italian Beef (Dry with the gravy on the side)

* Street Stand Chicago Hot Dog

some other stuff that wasnt Chicago Related. But had no choice due to x y z factors (it was late, no time, etc)

but overall, I only ate at around 8 spots total. (including the ""non chicago related"" spots).

some other spots and/or foods I wanted to try were

* Pequods

* Lous

* Deepdish &amp; Tavern style pizza

* Haralds chicken Shack

* Jims original

* Kasama

* Portillo's (to compare)

I dont quite recall how much each food was. But it definitely felt cheaper than in Seattle. Except for any kind of street stand areas (I ate a chicago dog at the vendor after visiting the shedd aquarium. that one was small and like $6. Doesnt come with fries)

Everything I was able to eat was a 10/10.

Au Cheval is something I highly recommend. I got the single Ch burger with Egg and bacon (of course) it comes out to ~~$36 with 20% tip. 

The burger itself is $17. an Egg is $3 and bacon is $7.

This part might be controversial and contradictory. Its worth it, but its also not worth it. If i ever go back to chicago, will I be getting it again? yes 100%. Although a bit over salted, its also definitely 1 of the top burgers I ever had. the egg and bacon add on surcharge is expensive. but its good and you HAVE to get it with the burger. Their egg is made delicately. sunny side up. the Bacon is very special and was similar to a maple smoked hickory peppered Bacon that were also thick. even if you dont get the bacon and egg, get it with the combo ATLEAST once. The burger is worth trying at least once.
The restaurant was also really amazing! its much smaller than it looks. but very well run.

and lastly, the land..... coming from Seattle, the flat lands were a freaken welcome and a gift... out of EVERYTHING, thats probably what i enjoyed the most. i stayed in chicago for 3 days/4 nights. and I was outside for majority of my time there. My god is it easy to travel around.... not to mention, public transport there is tier 1 (atleast in comparison to WA...)

in general 10/10. Chicago is a highly recommended spot to visit by me. I want to go there again some time soon. (its even making me want to move to Chicago....)",AskChicago,210,1722283748.0,88,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1ef9fk6/chicago_review_first_time_visit_unbiased_opinion/
Is the restaurant industry this bad for jobs right now?," I moved here a month ago and with a year of restaurant experience started looking into hosting and server positions. Its been a struggle, I’ve been hearing nothing, but here’s my process if you think there might be some better changes to be made:

•I started off with culinary agents. It was on fire at first, interviews lined up every day. Was using a CV template, had my personal deets on my experience and whatnot. Then, radio silence. Since that first week, only 2-3 other interviews had been scheduled and nothing. 

•Decided to show some dedication by going in person, as well as calls — SOO many phone calls. If they were hiring, i’d offer to come by in person and bring my resume, fill out an application. So far, nothing from them.

•If i did get to chat with the manager in person after bringing resume, id call back a week later to follow up. Ask if they’re still looking, so on so forth. 

•If they advised me to apply online, i would call a week later to follow up. When I apply I had a personalized CV for every spot. Either the manager wasn’t in, so I’d be given an email, or they’re still mulling it over for another two weeks. 

•I’ve done spur-of-the-moment walk ins, either if they had a sign outside or just looked appealing, had a sit-down style that I know would need servers. Leave the resume, fill out application. Call back a week later - they’re still reviewing.

Is it THIS bad man? Maybe it’s the time of year, but I was hoping i’d be making some progress. I don’t doubt some more qualified applicants come along for so many of these. It’s not like I have zero experience. I’ve asked managers if they prefer folks coming in person or applying online - almost all say they appreciate the dedication of dropping in. Still, nothing. I have a nest egg to last a few more months but being 1/3 into my time to find a job and having no progress is chilling. 

Does my process seem flawed? Is it a bad time of year? I feel like i’m going crazy here. There are hundreds of restaurants in each individual neighborhood alone.

Plea for Help: My brother's OCD has become dangerous to his health. Does anyone know of any free or low-cost services provided by OCD specialists in the city?,"My youngest brother, 20, has OCD. He's been standing since 3am doing his compulsions (mostly counting in patterns) and it's 8:31pm as I begin to write this, so he's been on his feet for 17 hours and 31 minutes. It's not an exaggeration, my other brother said he's been up since 3am and he's only sat down to use the toilet, which is also a compulsion.

My brother with OCD keeps my other brother up all night. My other brother hasn't worked for a year now, and I feel part of it is because he can't sleep at night because our brother with OCD keeps him up at night.

His OCD has never gotten this bad and I'm afraid it'll only get worse, which I can't even imagine what that would look like. I don't have the time, skills, or knowledge to support him, and neither do any of our family members. My parents and me work full-time jobs and my mom in particular works two 12 hour days during the week. I have night classes.

Our mom in particular has been affected emotionally the most, aside from our brother who has OCD, which has brought nothing but misery to him. She's told us that sometimes she cries while at work because my brother is sick and we're pretty much helpless.

He started showing signs of anxiety as a child and compulsions in high school. Now it’s all-consuming. When our parents leave for work, he breaks down crying while continuing his rituals alone. He currently sees a psychotherapist at Mt. Sinai every Tuesday for an hour but it doesn’t seem to be helping.

We need help. Does anyone know of free or affordable OCD specialists, particularly those experienced in severe cases? Even a lead on community-based mental health resources would mean a lot.

How big of an issue is catcalling and sexual harassment?,"Hi everyone!  I am 20 (F) and from London. I'm planning to solo travel to Chicago sometime between late August and early September. After learning about the city, the architecture, cultural diversity and history, I'm excited to visit. I'm 100% sure I'd like to go and will be booking a flight soon. I'll be staying either in Lincoln Park, River North or Lakeview. 

Coming from a major city, I do experience catcalling regularly or men trying to talk to me particularly during the summer. I asked ChatGPT (I know I know ;-;) and it said that catcalling in Chicago is 'rare' and 'socially frowned upon' and only really 'very late at night, near busy transit hubs, if someone is drunk. And even then, it's usually mild and short'. I started researching and came across a few posts on the matter on this sub from years ago that greatly contradict this.

Currently, how prominent is catcalling within Chicago and how likely am I to experience it? I'm worried about this factor because in my home city it is a constant issue, I have really bad anxiety, am very shy and  have a very soft quiet voice that causes men to not take no for an answer. I don't want to endanger myself alone in another country. Is it necessary for me to carry pepper spray?

As women, it is incredibly uncomfortable and anxiety inducing to have to deal with this. :( Is it predominantly words or does it often escalate into following and touching?

Bonus if the restaurant itself delivers and I don't have to download a stupid app. Also bonus if you have a favorite dish from the place you recommend. Also I am a BIG wimp when it comes to spicy food so just know that about me.

What are some inexpensive places to visit that a 9 year old girl will enjoy?,"I'm visiting Chicago from the UK next month, my daughter is 9 and really wanted to come to America, but specifically didn't want to go to New York. I've visited Chicago a couple of times and really enjoyed just being there, so I suggested a visit to Chicago, and she's really looking forward to it.

She saw a YouTube short about some sort of slime place, and is most insistent that we do that, and that's going to cost me 60 bucks for probably an hour's fun. She wants to eat a hot dog and some pizza, and she loved the Garrett's popcorn that I brough back so wants to go there too.

So you see, everything is costing me.

I'm arriving on a Sunday night, got Monday and Tuesday all day (with a visit to the slime place Tues morning), and we're leaving to go back to O'Hare on Wednesday at about 4pm. 

I reckon she'd enjoy spending a bit of time on Navy Pier, and I know that'll end up costing me too. Not sure about the zoo, I'd rather spend time doing something I can't do at home. 

I'm just wondering what else she might find interesting, and most importantly that will keep her out of American Girl! Doesn't have to be free, but I'd rather not spend a thousand bucks on this trip.

We're staying near Grand on the Red Line. Happy to use the L or walk about a bit to get to places.

Aside from finding pizza, a hot dog, and for me an Italian beef, are there any other spots where we could eat? If I can have a nice beer at the same time even better. Any suggestions for breakfast in my part of Chicago or the loop?",AskChicago,17,1745492207.0,77,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1k6palb/what_are_some_inexpensive_places_to_visit_that_a/
Bears vs Dallas - What to do after game?,"Hey everyone,

My husband and I lucked out and scored Skybox tickets to the Bears/Dallas game in a few weeks through his work (perfect timing, since it’s also his birthday 🎉). I travel all the time for work, so this kind of trip is nothing new for me — airports, cities, late nights, eating and drinking my way around… honestly I’m shocked I haven’t been taken yet 😂. Actually, that's not funny. I digress.

My husband, on the other hand, does *not* do this. Like, ever. He is a country boy through and through. The idea of walking around the city after dark with drunk football fans is basically the opposite of his usual weekend. I want to make this a *fun* and unforgettable trip for him, not overwhelming.

Here’s the plan so far:

* Stay in a nearby suburb (hotel is booked)
* Uber (or taxi?) to/from Soldier Field for the game? I know neither can drop off or pick up directly at the stadium, so curious which is the better bet. I've only used Ubers when traveling.
* After the game, I want to find some good food and cheap drinks nearby to keep the night going. We’re totally fine walking a bit (well, I am) even up to an hour if the vibe is worth it.

Now, here’s where I need advice:

1. My husband is nervous about wearing his Dallas gear. He’s never been to a game like this before, and he’s always been kind of a sheltered country guy. I *am 99.8% certain* everything will be fine but since he’s so worried, I need reassurance from you guys that he isn’t about to get thrown into a dumpster for repping Dallas 😂 (Worst case scenario, I’ll just get enough beers in him that he forgets the booing and maybe heckles back a bit😉).
2. We are HUGE foodies and he absolutely LOVES pizza. We’re also pretty big drinkers. Half our bill is usually alcohol so I'd like to keep it semi cheap. I know, I know, we're in the city and it'll be unavoidable to an extent. We’re totally willing to spend more if there’s a “must-go” spot, but also love a good dive bar with cheap drinks and killer food.

I just want this to be the BEST birthday trip ever for him. The kind of night where he thinks, “why don’t I do stuff like this more often?” Any tips or must-hit spots would be amazing.

Side note/joke for context - Last year, I tried to plan him a special birthday trip. Booked a tee time for us both at a gorgeous golf course and got completely rained out. Stayed overnight at a casino and proceeded to lose our asses. Finally, I had a highly rated dinner planned with a “Happy Birthday cheesecake” surprise. They brought it out FIRST with a singing candle.... before he even got a drink.

So yeah… help me give this man something better to remember than soggy golf, empty pockets, and premature cheesecake!",AskChicago,1,1756925369.0,53,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1n7nddf/bears_vs_dallas_what_to_do_after_game/
What is a good bar/lounge to meet and chat with people midweek?,"I'm overnighting in Chicago on Wednesday and am hoping to find a new (to me) bar or lounge with a chatty, social vibe. My usual spot when I'm in town is Monk's, but I'm looking for a vibe that's a little more cocktail-y, slightly dressy, etc. I'm in my late 30s, so not interested in a scene that's dominated by the &lt;25 crowd. Staying on Mag Mile, so the ideal place is between Old Town and the South Loop. Bonus points for live music that's enough to fill the gaps in conversation but not so much you can't talk without being rude or shouting.

Finding a bar with a good vibe and temporarily connecting with a stranger is one of my favorite things to do when I'm on the road. I think it's good practice for being human :) Some memorable nights include:

* Meeting two ATCs in the skinniest bar in OKC and hearing all about their work
* Walking back to the hotel from Rosh Hashanah services in Seattle, happening upon a dive bar that was doing karaoke, and laying down a couple bangers with the pals I made
* Discovering (at Monk's!) a guy who had attended to the same college at the same time as me. We discovered that we knew some people in common but had never heard of each other.
* Hearing about all eight grandchildren from a woman whose train was delayed at Union Station
* Connecting with a geologist in Stovepipe Wells (Death Valley) as she was meandering across the country with her Aussie Shepherd

Where can I meet the next interesting person? Is the Zebra Lounge a good spot for me? Thanks in advance for the recs!

  
e: After checking out all the recommendations, I think I'm gonna start my evening at Sparrow and go from there. Walking distance makes it appealing, it looks like the kind of thing I'm looking for, and there are plenty of other options nearby if it doesn't pan out.

"Irishman seeking things to do, places to drink, local knowledge please?","This is another looking for things to do post.

Traveling from Des Moines to Chicago for Concert 11/08/2025?,"Hello!

My girlfriend and I are traveling from Des Moines IA to Chicago for a concert at The Salt Shed 11/08/2025. We've never traveled from Des Moines to a big city like Chicago before. 

We plan to leave Des Moines around 7am and check in at our hotel (Crowne Plaza on Halsted St) around 3pm 11/07 and will have free time all night 11/07 up until the show start time around 7pm 11/08.

We're here to politely ask for any travel advice, dining advice, etc. ahead of the show. Mainly looking for good food spots near our area, advice for traveling and what to go and see whilst were in Chicago for a couple of days. 

This is my girlfriends dream concert experience and I just want her experience to be the best it could possibly be. Any advice would be beyond appreciated. We are admittedly super untraveled and will take any advice ahead of our trip. 

Thank you!

EDIT: Budget is essentially not to go Bankrupt. We're going to see Grizzly Bear at The Salt Shed. We already have hotel reservations as well as parking.

Living Recommendations for Chicago?,"Hello all,

I (30 M) am moving to Chicago from Boston for work, and would love to hear some recommendations on neighborhoods or areas to live in. I have it narrowed down to a few areas, but would love the community’s opinion, additional recommendations, or thoughts on the vibe of the neighborhoods I’ve shortlisted from my own research. Below are some logistical information and qualities that I value, and am hoping that I can find a place to live that aligns with that. TIA for your help, feel free to DM with recommendations or if you need more details and let me know if there’s another sub I should be putting this in or flairs I should add to garner attention (First time posting on Reddit ever)!



***DETAILS***

**Working Area:** Financial district, hybrid working (Tues-Thurs in office)

**Short list of areas I’ve liked:** Streeterville, West Loop, Lincoln Park, and Wicker Park. One thing I wasn’t sure of was the overall “vibe” of these neighborhoods, so I’d like some insight on that if possible. The activities portion below might help the community with that. Safety of the neighborhoods is high on my priority list as well, though I think all of these are going to be fine.

**Type of space:** 1 bedroom or studio, plan on living alone. More bedrooms is okay if it falls in budget

**Length of stay:** Ideally 2-3 years

**Living budget:** $3000 maximum for rent and utilities total, though less is also acceptable. Parking is not going to be an issue, for the reasons below. May get a bike, but that depends on what I hear from the sub.

**Travel and logistics:** I plan on leaving my car with my parents as the one they have is old and ready to die at any minute. Because of this, I highly value having things within walking distance (like 5-6 blocks or less). Obviously it wouldn’t be possible to have every one of my needs in walking distance but at least having a grocery store and a gym (if the building doesn’t have one) within walking distance is a must. I’d also like a couple of restaurants or bars/breweries in walking distance, but I can be flexible on that through public transport, ride shares, and biking.

**Activities and interests (AKA need to make friends):** I’m a massive nerd of all things (Warhammer, D&amp;D, anime, video games, board games, you name it) and I’d like to get into intramural or beer league sports (I love volleyball, though only beach or sandy volleyball) and dance once I move. These activities I’m willing to take public transport or Uber too, though walking distance would be preferable. Other than that, I also love all the standard things people love (food of all cultures, great cocktails, pets). I’m also single and would love a neighborhood where I can meet people to start a relationship with, though that’s what I hope the activities will help with.

Is it safe to get the train from O'Hare International Airport?,"Context: I am an Australian, living in Sydney. My sister and her family moved to Chicago last year. The company my dad works for has offices in Chicago, so he gets to visit her every now and again. Sadly I am yet to visit.

My dad just flew in to Chicago to visit my sister (she lives in the northern suburbs near Wrigley Field; they often walk to events at the stadium). When he is there for work the company sends him a taxi, but this time her is there purely to visit the family. He was instructed by my brother in law that under no circumstances to get the train from O'Hare. He mentioned violent crime and homeless people soliciting for funds. He then suggested a taxi from the Airport to their place as (his claim) it is difficult to drive to the airport and arrange a pick up. I was very confused by this suggestion. *""2pm is peak hour"".*

My plan for when I eventually visit was to get the train from O'Hare to Irving Park, then the bus to her place, or purely to tick off a part of my adventure, to get the train into town, then change for the red line and head north. I am of the belief that one of the best ways to get to know a city is via its public transport network.

Seeing as O'Hare is one of the busiest airports in the world, I would have expected a large amount of people travelling to and from the airport every day, meaning a lot of eyes, thus less danger. My brother in law also mentioned that one was required to get a tram from the international terminal to the railway station.

**What are the facts on the ground?**

* Is crime actually an issue on the train? Crime is something I have honestly never throught of when on a train.
* Is there decent frequency to the Airport?
* Are there many homeless people on the trains soliciting for funds?
* Is my BIL just not wanting to pick up dad from the airport?

For context and comparison, at Sydney Kingsford-Smith (SYD) airport, there are two train stations, *Domestic* and *International* respectively. There are 8tph (trains per hour) during most time periods, with 4tph in the late night. It is 10 minutes from Central to Domestic, and 12 minutes to International. The new airport, Western Sydney Nancy-Bird Walton International Airport (WSI) will open in 2027. They are advertising 6tph frequencies on the new trainline under construction, but a requirement to interchange at St Marys to get to Central (51 minutes to Central, 8tph peak, 4tph off peak).",AskChicago,0,1744593671.0,71,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1jyn6yn/is_it_safe_to_get_the_train_from_ohare/

If there was nothing else to see/do in the area, I would not have queued up for 90m. Maybe it's the style of pizza we weren't impressed with or maybe it was because the classic pizzas didnt come out lip burning piping hot and the cheese pull did not look like photos haha... we actually rated the classic malnati salad higher than the pizza lol because it tasted like crack. The pizza wasnt a sloppy mess, but i thought the buttered crust would be thicker, crunchier on the bottom. And just hotter in general when served. Also there's not a lot of flavor or seasoning. Did they do this on purpose so that you can taste/feel the butter more?

Will You Help Me Identify a Memory/Building From the Year 2000?,"EDIT: Answered! It's Horween Leather Company. Thanks y'all!

Hey y'all, thanks for taking the time. In fall/winter 2000 I was a wee lass of twenty tagging along with an older friend who was moving to Chicago. We drove from Oregon and I had a fake ID, which means I was out every night at the clubs. I remember about 35% of my time in Chicago, a time span that ended up being months because I loved the city so much. I saw Tony Bennett in what was then called the Sears Tower while working as a temp at a catering company, walked through Cabrini late at night bc it was a shortcut to the loft where my friend's boyfriend lived, met a lot of musicians and may have slept with some of them. But we're not here for my memoirs...here's my question:

One night my friend's new boyfriend took us to this big brick building (long, maybe 4-6 stories tall) after we'd left the club- very late at night/early morning. We climbed the fire escape and got in through a window. I think we were trying to get to the roof. The building was, I think, multi-use. Huge windows. Some of the floors/areas seemed empty or abandoned, there were a few offices. At one point I remember standing in a large, dark, empty room and through the window I could see people working in a tannery. Idk if I was looking into another building but in my memory it is categorized as the same building, so maybe the building was on a corner (or I am old and was too unsober to remember properly).

We left the building through a door, setting off the emergency alarm, and ran from a security guard. I don't think we were on the bottom floor when we left. But I will never forget seeing those people working super late at the tannery. Idk what it was, that just felt incredibly strange to me, probably because it was unexpected for me, not having lived in a big city before.

I vaguely remember a club called The Green Dolphin being nearby, but I could be wrong.

Obviously Chicago has changed so much. I have found some of the places from this time in my life (like the lofts that were near Cabrini, still lofts, by the L-Train). I've been back to the city but left before 2001 and never moved back, have just visited. I'd love to know more about this building if anyone has any information...because I am writing about this time in my life. Also, there was a club called Exit. RIP to that club.

Is foot traffic down in Chicago?,"I visited Chicago for a few days to meet a supplier. I had free time to walk around and some immediate observations were just how empty the streets felt. 

Now granted I live in New York, and a great deal of Manhattan is packed with people, stores, and art installations on every bloc. 

But I’m also very familiar with DC and San Francisco, two cities that have some of that same energy in a smaller package. 

LA/Miami are more car oriented, but with Chicago I expected something closer to NY and got something very different. 

Mind you I walked around the loop and Michigan Ave. so I didn’t get a chance to explore the South Side or Chinatown. I probably went from the Lake down past the bean on the other side of the river and went inland as far as Willis Tower. 

I was there on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. I was out both early in the morning after 9am, 3pm, and around midnight. It’s November obviously so I don’t know if that changes anything… 

But pretty much very few people even in downtown central areas. The Bean had a lot of tourists taking pictures and its plaza area felt alive, but outside of that it felt like most of the storefront areas were closed or dying. 

This isn’t an economic assessment, just the mood I got from the city. Many streets had blank storefronts with parking lots and air vents walling off the streets. The More commercial part of Magnificent Mile had some big brands but not a lot of people, and the business district around Willis Tower was completely empty. 

I get things vary neighborhood to neighborhood, but I was in the heart of downtown and it felt like a small city with tall buildings. I can’t explain the sensation but San Francisco is objectively smaller yet it made me feel like I was in New York more than Chicago. Even DC around DuPont Circle had more going on, let alone Georgetown. 

I’m not trying to bash Chicago. On the positive side I didn’t see many homeless people and it was clean compared to other places I’ve been to. But I was expecting more from a dense and walkable city. 

Downtown Miami was worse IMO, but they have always been car centric and most of the energy is by the beach. With Chicago I didn’t find that center of energy, and the streets felt kinda dead. 

And this is a bit more out there, but all the brands I found were basic big brands, I’m used to stumbling upon something cool or different when I walk around a big city and it just wasn’t there. Maybe there are clubs and rooftop bars I missed, but even the nightlife felt… missing? 

I was only there for three days so I’m not a voice of authority at all. I just wanted to know if this is a wider trend locals are aware of or is it just me? 

And outside the loop/downtown area, are there places like Greenwich Village or Georgetown? I still had fun tbh, the Carbon building was cool to see, no hate. And I never felt endangered or threatened so there is that. The way the streets are layered is weird, but the alleyways look cool so whatever.

Visiting Chicago for the first time this weekend – what should we do?,"Hey everyone, I’m bringing my girlfriend to Chicago this weekend and neither of us have really been before. We’re getting in Friday and leaving mid-day Sunday.

We’re staying at the Hyatt Centric The Loop. I already made dinner reservations at Bistro Monadnock for Friday night, but outside of that we’re pretty open and would love suggestions. Looking for things that are fun for a first-time visit — food spots, neighborhoods to walk around, bars, live music, museums, views of the city, anything like that.

Open to both touristy must-dos and local favorites, especially stuff that’s easy to get to from the Loop. Appreciate any recommendations on how to make the most of a short weekend.

What neighborhood should I stay for a long weekend in June?,"I’ve narrowed my search for lodging to a few places within my price range and was wondering if I could get some advice from locals. Two are in uptown, one in wicker park, one in Logan Square, and one kind of in the northeast part of Lincoln Park. I’m planning on a Cubs game, the art institute, probably an architecture tour, some other history oriented activities, and most importantly gorging myself on food. I’ll definitely be interested in having some drinks and a nice dinner one night but other than that pizza and ethnic food will be the move. I’ll be driving in but would like to limit my driving once there, or preferably not drive at all. I’ve got no problem with public transportation and can walk for just about forever. Do any of these areas jump out as major do’s or don’ts? Thank you so much!

Visiting 12/26–12/30 — Train vs Uber advice + must-see holiday stuff?,"Hey r/askchicago!

My wife and I will be in town December 26–30, staying on the Magnificent Mile. We’ve only planned two things so far, both concerts  

Waco Brothers at The Hideout on 12/27
The Old 97’s at SPACE in Evanston on 12/29


Everything else is wide open, so I’d love some local advice.

Questions:

For getting to The Hideout and SPACE, would you recommend taking the train/CTA/Metra or just Uber/Lyft, especially late at night and in winter?

What’s something cool or unique we shouldn’t miss while we’re here?

My wife likes Christmas lights and holiday decorations. Are there still any great places to walk around and enjoy the festive vibe after Christmas?

Also, a local friend recommended Pequod’s for deep-dish, which we’re planning to try. Any other must-eat places or hidden gems?

Thanks in advance for the suggestions!

"First time in Chicago, 4-day itinerary, any recommendations?","Day 1:

Arrive at the hotel in River North at 4 PM.

Chinatown &amp; Ping Tom Memorial

Should I visit the Museum Campus on Day 2 after Grant Park and the Harold Washington Library so that I can spend the next day in Chinatown? Or would that be too much for one day (Day 2)? 

Is Chinatown a must-see or should I replace it with another place?

I’m also not sure where to fit Navy Pier and the Magnificent Mile into my itinerary. They’re very close to my hotel, so I’m open to moving them to another day.

Finally, I’m wondering which places are better to visit in the morning and which in the evening.

where can I stay (outside of downtown) that lets me use the train easily/safely to get into downtown?,"hello!

I am coming in for the Oasis concert in August and want to start planning parts of my trip.

It seems like there are two options if I don't want to deal with driving into/out of downtown Chicago for the actual concert itself. I'm driving to Chicago from another state so I'm fine to drive in the day before, park at a hotel (or parking garage) and let my car be for a few nights OR stay outside the city, park at a train station, etc. I just don't want to deal with driving into downtown chicago day of the concert and attempt to park at soldier field sort of thing.

1 -- stay downtown, within walking distance of soldier field (which, obviously, is an expensive hotel price)

2 -- use the train to get in/out of downtown chicago and stay further out of the city, but near a train line.

Does anyone have any recommendations for option 2? An area not in downtown thats safe and fun and near either 1. a train stop I can walk to from a hotel or 2. a train station I can safely park at until wee hours of the morning?

Possible Texan moving to Chicago,"Hello!
I'm signing up for job corps, and being given an opportunity to choose what state/city I wanna work in. I'm currently picking between a few, and one of my top 3 choices is Chicago! I'm hoping to get a good pro/con list going, and was wondering what people thought of living there! How's renting look, how safe if it, whats the weather actually like, that kind of stuff!
Google has a lot of information about it, but I would love to hear from someone who actually lives there or has visited before!

*Update!*

I see where some confusion came on what I was looking for with this post now! Some very kind people explained where I had messed up, and I thank you for that! I've had an account but I've not used reddit for very long, so I'm still learning and appreciate the patience! 

My situation is this! I am going into job corps! They will provide food, health care, and housing for as long as I am there to learn my preferred trade! They then provide resources to help me get a job, teach me how to apply for health care, college, all of that! They also provide transportation to the center, including plane tickets! My plan is to find someplace that suits me and has a good culture, complete my training there, and then attempt to settle down in my chosen city!

The big things I look for when considering where I'll live is this!
1. Safety! How safe is the city for women/queer folk just walking around during the day? Not at night, because I will be operating in a very strict schedule, so for me the daytime would be more important to know. This is outside of standard stranger danger, no headphones, head on a swivel levels of common sense. 

2. Public transportation! Is there a bus system that would allow someone to go to fun or important locations like restaurants or government buildings? How friendly are these systems for disabled people?

3. Weather! I prefer rainy/cool weather, it's why I even considered the city to begin with! But how much of that is over exaggerations? What are/ how often are the common natural disasters? Like in Texas we have tornado season, but media makes that out to be a much bigger deal than any one who actually lives here.

These are the kind of things I'm looking for, because I know alot of travel blogs, and similar websites you get when googling cities tries to sell a not so accurate version of the city itself! So I wanted to ask people who actually spent time there What they thought, and what someone from outside should be on the look out for as a newcomer that MAY seem like comon sense to you as a resident. 

The reason I'm asking instead of just reading another similar post is because job corps puts me in a slightly different situation. Most advice about moving would focus on job/housing wich isn't an issue for me for atleast a few months to almost 2 years (depending on the corse). And since job corps is designed to churn out workers for desirable fields I'll (hopefully) have a stable well paying job by then. I personally will be going into manufacturing and delivering, as well as be working towards a forklift certification, wich already helps me get a better paying job in that field due to it being a desirable skill for employers.",AskChicago,38,1714073755.0,77,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1cd0eic/possible_texan_moving_to_chicago/

Ideally places that have a young-ish crowd, but we're not really into proper clubs.

Moving from Sydney this weekend. How do I make new friends?,"Hi guys, I posted a while ago when I was considering moving to your beautiful city. Since then, I've decided to make the move! 

A little about me, I'm a 26 year old male raised in New Zealand (but living in Sydney for the past couple years). I'm ethnically Indian, go bouldering in my spare time and like to play badminton or board/video games with mates. 

I'm landing in Chicago this Friday (10/10/25).

I am a social person and had many good friends who I'll miss dearly. I'm most afraid of how my social life will be. I know zero people in all of America, let alone Chicago.

I was hopefully planning on getting a roommate so that I can meet someone local. How do you find them? I realistically have no maximum rent budget (thanks job). I'd love to live in a young, professional area.

Also, I'm kind of scared of the weather haha. I've never lived in a cold climate. Is it frowned upon if I wear my ski jacket some nights, will I look really out of place? 

What do you think my best course of action is?

First ever trip to America! Any tips?,"Howdy Chicagoans, I'm a Brit who's about to embark on my first ever trip to the good ole US of A this year! My partner and I have decided to make Chicago our first stop on our American Adventure, as it just seems like a way more interesting and unique experience than the typical NYC tourist trip.

We've put together a loose itinerary of places we want to visit and eat at based on our online research, but we would love some pointers and advice from any local experts out there. We're also on the hunt for some evening activities to make the most of our time in your amazing city. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!

SIDE NOTE: We're big local music fans and would love some tips as to where we can catch some basement shows!

**EDIT**: I just want to say a massive thank you to all of these wonderful, helpful and welcoming comments below. We’ve been made aware that some of these ventures are slightly impossible and geographically some of our days all over the place.

Day 1

Day 6

Day 7

What are the laws with permit parking?,"Went to a show at the Aragon the other night and got a parking ticket for supposedly parking in a permitted area.

We parked on the west side of N Winthrop Ave just south of W Ainslie St just before the entrance ramp to that large building on the street. I’m 99% sure I didn’t see a permit parking sign between W Ainslie and the entrance ramp, so I assume that’d mean it’s safe to park there. As we were leaving, I noticed a permit since on our side of the street, but it was at the other end of the street near W Lawrence Ave.

If there is a permit sign anywhere on the side of the street you’re parking on, does that mean the whole side of that street is permit parking end to end? Didn’t walk down the street at the time to confirm as it was dumping rain and it’s quite a far drive for us to quickly check. I would make the drive to save $75 if it’s seems like we were in the right.

Question for all the Chicago nurses?,"Mid 20s woman looking to move to the city beginning of next year! Been doing a lotttt of research and just looking for some insight from my fellow nurses. For context, at time of moving I’ll have 3 years ICU experience (CTICU and trauma) and I’ve mainly been looking at Rush hospital but will also look at NW

1.	⁠In your opinion/experience, what pay do you think I could expect? I know Chicago hospitals are required to post pay, but I’m curious what I can expect/negotiate as a nurse with 3 years. I just don’t wanna be offered new grad pay and not know it

If you live alone in the city, how much is your rent?

Help Find This Hidden Chicago Airbnb Studio from 2019/Early 2020 – Want to Recreate Magic Moment?,"Hey Chicago Redditors (or Airbnb pros!),
This might be a total long shot and probably a lost cause, but I’m desperately trying to track down an Airbnb I stayed in with my boyfriend back in late 2019 or very early 2020. It was our first big trip together, and the place was so quirky and memorable that we’d do anything to find it again to celebrate over 6 years together. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to old receipts, emails, or my old Airbnb account anymore After scouring the site myself, I don’t think it’s listed these days. If anyone remembers hosting something like this, or stayed in a similar spot, or even knows how to dig deeper into Airbnb archives, please help a girl out!
Here’s everything I can remember about the place:
•  Location: About 15-20 minutes from downtown Chicago (by car or L train).It was in an unmarked building accessed through an alley—super hidden gem vibe. Outside was either brick or cement block. Right down the street was a CVS or Walgreens in a strip mall/plaza. High security and there was another place with ATMS located right inside 2 glass doors. 
•  Layout: It was a studio-style apartment, no separate bedrooms. Everything was open: a small couch right next to the bunk beds, a nice kitchen table for meals, and the bathroom was the first thing you saw when you walked in the front door (right at the entrance).
•  Sleeping Setup: King or queen-sized bunk beds built right against a full wall of windows overlooking the downtown skyline—waking up to those city lights was unreal! There was a small TV mounted on or near the bottom bunk for lazy viewing.
•  Bathroom Details: Fancy wall-mounted soap dispenser in the shower (like hotel-style, not the usual pump bottles).
We ate at Nico Osteria (1015 N Rush St in Gold Coast) one night, which was about 15-20 minutes away—
If this rings any bells, or you have tips on how to search old listings (without account access), I’d be eternally grateful. We’re planning a surprise trip back to Chicago to relive it all—fingers crossed this isn’t impossible! Thanks in advance for any leads or ideas. ❤️

Is Kimball Ave a recommended area to stay in?,"
Hi, I know Chicagoans hate when people ask if places are safe but I searched the internet for answers and got mixed results/no results. I’m a black female (18) and this will be my first ever solo trip. I’m from a city that is generally safe and small, safe enough to where I can walk around the town at night with my headphones on lol. 

That being said I reserved an apartment that has no reviews due to it being new to the site, but I decided to give it a chance because it looked nice and is relatively cheap. Took me awhile to get to my question sorry but I’m just wondering if Kimball ave (cross street is W Wabansia Ave..) is a safe area? I did a little street view peek and it did look a little rough but, I don’t wanna judge a book by its cover and I’m just wondering if any locals know anything about it.

(Also a little extra excerpt if you care, I don’t drive yet and this place is about a 2 hour walk away from millennium park and all the Chicago goodies (and I do like a good walk), and about 50 minutes on a ride taking 2 different buses.

Apartments for young working professionals?,"hi everyone! i'm a 23 year old girl, and may be moving to chicago relatively soon for work. unfortunately, i dont know anyone in the city as i'm moving from california- and was just wondering which areas would be best to meet new people (im single, idk if that matters), mingle with likeminded professionals, and overall build a good network of friends outside of work. 

i will not be bringing my car, and am specifically looking within the river north/west loop areas (but im open to anything!). my office is located in west loop- and the reason i want to be near there, is because i would like to walk to work (or take the train if i absolutely have to) if possible. i'm looking for a 1 bed 1 bath apartment (not studio preferably). my budget is around $2k - i'm not sure if this is completely unrealistic, but of course i'd be willing to go higher if absolutely necessary. 

not sure if this is relevant, but might give you an idea about me/what i enjoy doing with friends in my free time i like: 

\- taking walks with friends + coffee/matcha runs

\- trying new workout classes

\- grabbing a drink in a nice outdoor area

\- finding new brunch spots

\- rooftop bars! and i love a good night out

\- essentially, would love to try new things! i'm completely open and spontaneous :)

  
so if anyone has any ideas for any apartment complexes/buildings/areas i should look into (even if its not river north/west loop) please let me know! would love to hear everyone's input. i really want to meet new people and find that one 'friend group' eventually haha.

In town for a few days. What jazz clubs and lesser known attractions should I consider?,"Arriving tomorrow and leaving Saturday most likely. Two of us in our mid-30’s here to see Oasis and have a good time. Going to cut to the chase:

1) I know Green Mill is very popular and gets packed quickly. We are staying in the River North Area and we’ll be getting to town around 7 PM. We need to check in, unload, and then hit the road. Is 8-8:30 on a Wednesday night too late at having a shot for a seat for a couple? If it is, we’ll go elsewhere. 

2) I see Andy’s offers late night jam sessions. It’s closer and they take reservations. This might be easier to manage. How is Andys and the jam session in particular? Should I catch a late show at Jazz Showcase instead?

3) We may try to fit another jazz club or blues club in on Friday. Any recommendations? I heard Kingston Mines mentioned multiple times. We’re not big dancers, but we’re cool with vibing at a table and having drinks while others dance or just watch music. 

4) We’ve done all the big tourist things. Last big one for us to do is the Field Museum. How long should we budget for a visit?

5) Time is a bit short, but is the Pullman National Historic Park worth visiting?

6) Any interesting lesser known museums or places to explore that most tourists are not aware of? Any cool neighborhoods or districts to walk through?

I’m moving to Chicago in April. What part of the city should I be looking at?,"
Title. Moving from STL. I lived in Chicago when I was in the military, loved it but I realize it was different living on base and going into the city than living there. That said, I’ve lived in some terrible parts of STL and want to live in a major metro that isn’t awful, in a part of the city with a lot of things to do.

My budget is ~1500/month, and I’ll have a car but be working remote with frequent air travel (2-4 trips per month). I don’t need a huge space (fine with a studio in fact, I have no furniture so less is more!), I’m just looking for something where I can walk or take the train 80% of the time to go do things. I’m fine with longer walks as I already do this for work trips in cities that allow it or require it for a week or so at a time. 

Where do you guys recommend? I’ve been looking at streeterville and the Gold Coast.

I don’t go out for night life a ton, but it is convenient living in those areas for when I do. Mainly looking for somewhere where criminal shenanigans isn’t heavy on a weeknight basis (dealt with/dealing with that in STL, not scared but would rather just not have the nuisance)",AskChicago,0,1731687087.0,43,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1grzuke/im_moving_to_chicago_in_april_what_part_of_the/
Couples trip - Tips for Chicago winter?,"
Hello everyone, 

My partner and I are planning on being in Chicago beginning the week of Christmas. I have seen people post about upcoming trips but most of them seem to be in October/November. We are from Minnesota so we are used to brutal winters but I am wondering how much winter clothing/gear we need to pack for Chicago? How is the boat tour during winter nights? How far are we going to be able to walk with tolerating the cold? We plan on staying downtown and I’ve already done extensive research on the CTA. I also plan on going through the Chicago food sub-reddit to get some recommendations. If you want to drop any onto this post, I don’t mind either. I also love cocktails, especially DIRTY martinis so finding good ones is ideal for me. My partner really only drinks Crown Apple unfortunately 🥴 so if you know of any cocktail lounges, bars, restaurants, etc., that you know for sure has Crown Apple please let me know. I’d like for them to be able to get a cocktail with me as well. Also, is there any restaurants we should make reservations for now? Or fairly early? Thank you!!!",AskChicago,0,1759264967.0,9,https://reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1nuonto/couples_trip_tips_for_chicago_winter/
Places to Visit in Chicago for the First Time on a Budget?,"Hi Everyone! I am visiting the Windy City for the first time this Friday night to see my long distance girlfriend for the first time. I’ll be staying at her place until early Tuesday morning, so my main expenses will be airfare, public transportation/rideshares, and food/activities. 

I’m a college student on a tight budget (around $300 for the trip, though I have a credit card for backup). I want to explore the city with her but don’t have a solid plan yet. Here’s what I’m considering:

1. Walk the Magnificent Mile and visit stores along the way (edit 2: You can tell i’m not a native… Did not realize that Michigan Ave was the Magnificent Mile..)
2. See Buckingham Fountain and the Wrigley Building
3. See the Art Institute of Chicago
4. See the Chicago Tribune building
5. Do the Hancock Tower tilt experience
6. See Sears Tower
7. Try classic Chicago food (Portillo’s Hot Dogs, Velvet Taco, (edit 3: I mentioned Velvet Taco because my gf said it was really good and went back to back, so wanted to see if it was good myself. Thought it was a Chicago staple, but looks like they’re everywhere, lol.) or some good Chicago Pizza since I’ve never had it before.)
8. Find an affordable but good spot for a nice date with my lady. (edit 1: took fine dining out because that isn’t a dealbreaker for me. As long as the vibe is nice, that’s fine with me).

Any advice or tips? Are there any must-try restaurants/must-see places that are unique but budget friendly? Also, would love any suggestions for cool, cheap, or free things to do! If there’s free events or free things to do around the city this weekend, that would be great!

Cat-Called and Followed,"I live in a relatively nice area in Chicago, and I've been here for a couple years. I've never felt singled out or unsafe - in fact it's probably the safest area I've ever lived in. 

But last night I was going out to meet some friends for drinks, and I was walking down the main road to the train station. This is a four lane, busy, well-lit street with heavy pedestrian traffic most times of the day and night.  I had my headphones in, but my music was low as is my habit at night.  I was crossing a side street, and a car was pulling up to turn onto the main road. It stopped and backed up out of the crossing area, which I thought was nice at first. 

Then the car honked - *beep beep* - and I heard a male voice. I ignored it as usual. My male friends know better than to try to yell at me from their cars at night, so I was pretty sure I didn't know who this was. Then several other voices joined in.  Even though I had my music down low I couldn't hear what they were saying, and I was not about to stop to find out. So I just kept my eyes ahead and my head high, and kept going. 

They turned onto the main road and followed next to me, still talking out the windows to me. There were cars parked along the road thank goodness, so they couldn't pull up right next to the sidewalk.  After about 15-20 feet of that they sped off, but I had a feeling in my gut that this wasn't over yet. I studied the back of the car as it drove off - my eyesight isn't great, so all I knew was it was a gold car and I knew the shape of the headlights and taillights from walking in front of the car and then watching it drive away.  

About 40 yards later, I see the car drive by me again!!  It slowed down for a heartbeat, and I could see all the passengers looking around at me (I was not looking directly at their car, just in my peripheral), but there were a lot of cars behind them so they did not slow down too much.  I saw the car turn down an alley right before the train station, and my stomach dropped. 

Again - there were a TON of people walking and driving around.  This was not a shady area. I had a group of young people right behind me the whole time. 

I braced myself, and tried to match my pace to the group behind me so I'd at least have other bodies nearby.  I started crossing the alley/street that I'd seen the car pull into - and there it was. Parked about 20 feet back from the road, running, with the lights off.  At this point I'm freaking the fuck out, and praying that they won't see me, but of course the lights came on as soon as I was in front of their car.  I start booking it towards the train station. None of the people around me (who had been walking behind me this entire time and saw every interaction with this car) were going to help. 

This car pulls onto the main road again and the guys are yelling: **""I'M SORRY FOR GIVING YOU A FUCKING COMPLIMENT. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.""**

*Not a word from any person who was out on the sidewalk with me.* I make it into the train station, and I see the car has stopped right outside of the station doors. Worried one of them was going to get out and follow me, I rush through the turnstile, get on the elevator that was thankfully waiting and close the doors immediately, and very luckily my train pulled into the station as soon as I got to the platform. 

What makes me so mad... as soon as I was on the train, I was blaming myself. 
""I shouldn't have worn this out tonight."" 
""I should have waited to put on my lipstick until I was at the bar.""
""I should have said something back to them.""
""Maybe I was imagining things, and they weren't really following me."" 
But once I got to my friends, I told one of them what happened, and I felt reassured that I wasn't crazy. That it was a big deal. That I was not to blame for their behavior. 

I hate that these assholes made me feel so powerless and defeated. And I hate that I still feel like I let them win by running away, and then being afraid to take the train home later that night.

I lost over 100lbs and all I got was this shitty sexual harassment.,"Yeah, the title kinda says it. I'd like to clarify there are worse things women experience, and women of all sizes get harased. And I wouldn't trade my improved health/life for anything. 

But I guess it's justust weird emotionally, and I was hoping you all would understand. It's common ""advice"" among weightloss groups that as you loose major weight, the men get nicer and women get meaner. Which some absolute bullshit, my female friends have been nothing but supportive. But yeah, past the litteral dating pool expansion, it's the increase in basic humanity that gets to me. I get more male eye contact, compliments, doors opened. Like I can't be mad at someone for litterally being nice to me, but at the same time, it pisses me off. 

And then there's the literal harassment, it's all increased. The random dick picks, the creepy customers, feeling unsafe on streets and in bars. And I'm not even model status, just more passable.
There's just this sick twisted irony to it all. I'm finally in control of my health and my body and sometimes it's like damn I whish I was fat enough to dance in club and not have anyone try to grind on me again. Weightloss communities celebrate ""non scale victories"", and there's so many good ones, like clothing and hikes and fitting in airplane seats, but no one prepared me that unwanted male harassment was going to be a measure of my success. And it pisses me off.

So here's to putting less stress on my internal organs, and doing more of the things I love. But also being a women is really hard sometimes, and there are days I miss my cloak of invisibility.

I just had the scariest Lyft ride of my life with an older male driver,"Today, I got into a Lyft and an older man (think 60s-70s) was the driver. He seemed nice enough and we shared small talk. He mentioned his wife and his 20 year old daughter and how his wife was ungrateful. 

Then, things got increasingly more alarming. He kept turning around to smile and stare at me and eventually says, “We should be friends!” I just smiled and laughed. He then pulled out a notepad and a pen and asks me to write down his number. I knew it would be best to comply and appease him, so, I do. I take the slip and put it in my purse. 

He continues to become more aggressive and repeatedly turns around and states “Promise you’ll call me? Promise you’ll text me? We can be friends! I can pick you up! Just text me, not call because my wife will wonder who it is.” He repeated this like ten times or more. 

At this point, I’m in full panic mode. I text a friend to call me and she does, so, I don’t have to speak with him. I then realize that I need to be dropped off anywhere but my house. So, I have him drop me off on another street and I pretend to go into another house.

I’m still shaking and I started crying when I told my mom what happened. I feel violated and unsafe because he might have my address.

I listened to my instincts today and left an AirBnB where I felt unsafe,"This week I had to go to another town to renew my documents. Since the appointment was very early, I rented an Airbnb room in the city. We currently have a curfew in place starting at 9PM, and I arrived at the place at 20:30PM.

At first I couldn’t find the house number in the listing. I called the host (who didn’t send me any check-in instructions) and he told me to go to another house number at the same street and he opened the electronic lock remotely from his phone. As I enter the house, it’s completely hazy with weed smoke and there are 3 older man in the kitchen.

One of them takes me to the room (RIGHT by the kitchen), and it’s clearly a room that had been in use up to that very last moment. He is still removing some of his belongings from the room as we speak. By that point I’m already feeling uncomfortable, but then I realize that the room has no lock.

There is a supermarket close to the street, so I tell the host I’ll go there quickly before curfew, and ask for the code for the house. He tells me to just call him and he will open it for me.

At this point it’s 8:40PM and curfew is almost starting. I’m in a weird city I don’t know, and not very sure if I want to spend the night there. I kept telling myself that I was overreacting and that it was fine, but I remembered a book that gets recommended a lot called “The Gift of Fear”, that explains that your body is able to detect threats better than you consciously can, and it’s important to listen to fear.

I texted my dad saying I was in a shady Airbnb and had to get a hotel. I booked the nearest available hotel room and I’m lucky enough that my parent has given me an emergency credit card that I never use, so I could pay for the hotel room. I walked there and managed to make it just 5min after curfew.

I explained what happened to the receptionist lady, and she was very understanding and even got me a free room upgrade. I slept soundly and feeling safe.

Would anything bad have happened if I stayed at that Airbnb? I don’t know. I just know that I wasn’t feeling comfortable at all and started to panic. But I’m happy I listened to my instincts and tried removing myself from a potentially bad situation. I felt very validated when I shared this with friends and they also thought it was very shady, because all the way to the hotel I was ashamed of how I was leaving the listing and probably overreacted. As someone that struggles with standing up for myself, this was a very empowering reminder that I’m getting better at it.

Listen to your instincts, ladies :-)

UPDATE: I sent a message to the AirBnB support about what happened and left a bad review detailing the problems with the listing. They haven't replied yet, and I think it might amount to nothing since I didn't take any pictures of anything, nor have I reported it within 24h of checking in.

"Professional Esports player admits to gang rape on stream. Yet, we supposedly do not need women and non-binary exclusive events.","I feel incredibly sick right now. I'm a member of an Esports organization, focused on competing and creating content within the FGC (fighting games community). Recently, there was a bit of a scandal in Esports as a whole because prominent individuals (men) were arguing that tournaments and events that are exclusive to women and non-binary folks (and organized by them) should not exist, that they serve no purpose, that things in professional gaming are much better now than in the past so these spaces are no longer needed, and that they're actually biased against men.

Today, it came to light that a prominent Street Fighter V player, who has won multiple tournaments and was currently set to play in this year's CPT (the biggest SFV event in the world, run by Capcom), went on twitch and while streaming, told a story about how he and 8 of his friends planned and executed the gang rape of his former girlfriend. He was laughing the entire time and his chat was happily going along with this. Warning for intense descriptions of sexual violence in the following clip: 

[Twitter link with the clip translated](https://twitter.com/CruzaderOnline/status/1479179544099794953)  

Most of the people on twitter I've seen responding have been condemning him, of course. Though disgustingly, he has his share of supporters saying the ex deserved it for being a ""hoe"" and they can understand his actions. 

Myself and many of the other women in our community are horrified - but I'm also angry - because, again, so many people in Esports continuously argue that women no longer face any issues in these spaces and therefore, should not be able to hold their own events (and that doing so is sexist against men). Yet, this particular individual felt *so safe* in the idea that *nothing* would happen to him for telling this story and that most of his audience would think it was funny and she deserved it, that he literally went on *twitch* and told it to the world while laughing. This is why women continue to feel uncomfortable and unsafe.",TwoXChromosomes,3350,1641507280.0,299,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/rxqig1/professional_esports_player_admits_to_gang_rape/
I got street harassed for the first time today while walking with my sister in Chicago. My sister says this has happened to her many times.,"I'm visiting her in Chicago where she is going to school and we were walking downtown after going to the museum. A man was waiting on the sidewalk and sidled up to walk with us. We pretended he wasn't there and picked up the pace. Then he set in with the verbal abuse. 

""Hey you cracker bitches get ready for the revolution. Racist cunts. White devils. We're gonna rape you and cut up your families and burn them.""

He went to 100 real quick. I was shocked but just kept walking, as if he wasn't there.

""That's right you heard me don't pretend you didn't hear me (calling out other black people around us) we all know you hear. You know she heard right that's right Imma tell these white devils what we got planned. You ever had a black dick before because that's all you gonna get when the brothers take Wall Street. You gonna get ripped the fuck open you little cracker ass bitches!""

At this point my sister and I were just staring straight ahead and walking as fast as possible.

""I bet you little devils voted for Obama thinking that would save you. Bet you gotta black friend ha! You're still gonna get burned alive hear me! Burned alive! And you better not cry when you burn cause we'll be burning away your sins. Your pale cave-dwelling lizard (???) sins! We're gonna make a black wall-street and all you crackers are gonna die!""

At this point he grabbed the rear of my dress and pulled.

""You hear me bitch! We're gonna burn your mother and your father and your brother and your babies too!""

I dunno how but I pretended like I didn't hear and he hadn't touched me and asked my sister ""which way are we going?"" pointing to the two crosswalks ahead.

""You're going with me cracker cunt.""

The way he said that more quietly than the shouting for attention from before was really scary for some reason, and because I didn't know what it meant.

Thankfully my sister directed me to stay on the block and turn the corner to the subway entrance, where there was a crowd spilling out. The man couldn't stay beside us in the crowd and he lost interest and turned heel to harass a couple coming up the stairs.


&amp;nbsp;

I'd been catcalled but never followed before and it really messed with me. My sister and I had to stop our conversation for many blocks and walk in silence enduring his verbal abuse. I wanted to pretend it didn't affect me but when she and I couldn't even feel good enough to speak on the train I had to admit it really, really, upset me. I spoke to my sister about it and she said this kind and other kinds of street harassment has happened to her many times before. One time it was similar to this but the man was waving a knife. She then mentioned, as if it were a funny story, that a similar incident led to her having her clothing torn up. I've never been in this situation before and finding out that my sister is living it has just further sent me reeling.",TwoXChromosomes,2,1502492139.0,42,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6t4tue/i_got_street_harassed_for_the_first_time_today/
Let a coworker come with me at my regular place and he really wanted it to be a date.,"Lesson learned, I guess. 

I ran into an coworker (well, ex-coworker, not that it makes much of a difference) going to a little restaurant I'm a regular at. We played catch up for a bit, he asked where I was going. I can't lie to save my life, though I'll try harder next time, so I told him. I let him ask me to come with and I guess I thought why not? It's a great place to hang out. I brought friends there, I'm always told I don't socialize enough, that I gotta take chances... so okay. Why not.

Once there he insisted a LOT that I get a drink with him (not alcoholic, it was midday, but a juice or soda or whatever). I didn't want to. I'd come there to eat, I never get a drink when I eat, I had water but it wasn't good enough for him so he insisted. (I didn't get one.)

He didn't want to sit at the table I picked which is the table I always sit at when I come there. I assume it's because it's a street facing kind of table where you sit next to each other not in front of. With the friends I had brought it was never a problem but he wanted another. We changed tables to one he picked (much, much less comfortable to eat at).

During the conversation he picked the subject of relationships and asked what I wanted from one (I hadn't even said I wanted one) and what my type was. I do have a type and it is *not* that guy at all. And I really didn't want to have to say that. So since I can't lie and it started feeling way too date-y for me I kind of blue screened and said nothing and made it all awkward. 

He did end up saying he wanted to be in a relationship with me, that I was polite and calm and respectful and that I smiled. And that because I was respectful like that he would respect my answer. Made me feel unsafe. Also I may be reading too much there but I wonder if he even liked me for... me... or if he felt I was simply a proper and respectable girl to date? I smiled to him at work to be polite. To be a nice coworker. Maybe I should have been more closed off.

After putting a stop to all this he insisted to pay for my food (that I had not touched at all). I didn't let him.

I suppose it's on me for being stupid enough to think this could, maybe, just be a friendly thing, that I should be open, for not clocking it earlier as a bad idea. I know this could have been much worse but I did *not* enjoy being on this pseudo date. If he had asked me first I would have said no. I'm not even available for relationships or dating.",TwoXChromosomes,530,1755986963.0,42,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1myekea/let_a_coworker_come_with_me_at_my_regular_place/
I can't believe that there are still men who feel entitled to talk over women on experiences of street safety,"This is particularly rampant on r/NYC that I've experienced but I'm sure it's everywhere. You get buried for pointing out that the experience in high crime neighborhoods is different for women, and that police presence/response is insufficient. They get absolutely hysterical when someone suggests that they should ask women for their opinions on street safety rather than speak for everybody.

They genuinely feel the need to tell women how safe or unsafe it is for them on the street, as well as those who are of Asian origin and unfortunately still targeted for that biological basis. I think it's no different than telling female victims of sexual assault that they shouldn't feel unsafe just because adult men typically never face this experience.

Trans women also face an incredibly dangerous situation on the streets being members of a marginalized group that often evokes an extremely violent response from men, and their experiences are systematically invalidated under a similar bucket.

Edit: this post was initially inspired by the impossibility of having a voice as a truly biologically marginalized person in major subs, and being asked to prove my own personal experiences of police protection being wholly lacking in places like NYC. But it's grown into something much greater where we can all see that this is sadly a very common experience everywhere, with real life consequences.",TwoXChromosomes,664,1698406658.0,110,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/17hlkli/i_cant_believe_that_there_are_still_men_who_feel/
"When ""you should be flattered"" is the response to feeling unsafe","
Yesterday I was walking home from the train a little later than usual, maybe 9pm, in a pretty normal residential area. I had my keys in my hand, headphones in but with no music, doing the usual woman safety calculus. I notice a guy on the other side of the street kind of matching my pace. At first I try to convince myself its nothing, but every time I slow down a bit, he slows. When I cross, he crosses. My stomach did that drop thing. 

I ducked into a small grocery that was still open and just wandered around pretending to look at stuff. He comes in too. At this point I am fully in panic mode, so I go straight to the cashier and quietly ask if I can wait there a bit because a man seems to be following me. The cashier looks over my shoulder, sees him, then laughs and says something like girl he is just checking you out, take the compliment. The man smiles at me, like we are all sharing some cute little joke, and I genuinely thought I might throw up.

I ended up calling my sister to come pick me up, which made me feel like a kid, but I did not want to walk out alone. On the ride home she was angry that the staff brushed it off and told me I should file a report with the store or even the police. I keep going back and forth in my head. Was I overreacting, or did my body just recognize a pattern I have been trained to ignore for years. I am so tired of having to second guess my own fear, because if the guy had done something and I had not listened to it, everyone would ask why I did not trust my instincts. I kind of want to go back and tell the cashier it is not a compliment when someone makes you plan escape routes on a Tuesday night. Has anyone actually pushed back in the moment when people say stuff like this, and did it help at all

Just had a barrister in the UK tell me that 80% of rape cases fail s women are lying,"He said... 

*Women don't get that they want from the  encounter such as s relationship they later claim rape.
*That if a man doesn't realise he is sexually assaulting/ raping someone he isnt
*If Women doesn't realise she is subject to sa or rape immediately it's because she hasn't been.

I do believe that there are false claims.  I Do not believe  they are majority

What I do believe is..

*Consent should not be just that there isn't loud objections. 
*intent is not the deciding factor. If someone is too drunk to consent, your intention doesn't matter. If someone says no, but you think we are playing hard to get, intent doesn't matter. If you have  made someone feel unsafe and they dont feel that they can refuse, and so just do what you want becuse they dont feel like they can do anyhring else  that is not consent. Consent is the only thing that matters. If you don't have clear consent then the intent and the story you tell yourself doesn't matter. You did not have consent. 
* Women who have experienced is sa and rape can struggle to understand or blame themselves. They look for why they did something wrong. They try and justify why it isn't sa or rape, because the reality is accepting and understanding that what has happened to them is wrong is so hard. You are then a victim. You have to understand that you are a victim of SA and rape. Sometimes it is easier to blame yourself and deny what is happening than it is to confront the reality of what happened. Most sa and rape is not a stranger on the street. Ita a friend, a boyfriend, a date. To say ""this person I knew is capable of committing sa or rape"" is one of the hardest things to accept. You feel like you got fooled. You feel you failed as you  trusted who didn't deserve it. You feel like it ws your fault.you also, often, have the narrative of that person telling you why it's your fault. Why it's not them. 

You  then get an otherwise bright and nice guy tell you why it's not really rape as, at the core, he doesn't understand, and clearly hasn't tried and your faith in the legal system takes another dent. 

Clearly not all claims are true and I think anyone who makes a false claims needs to understand the harm they do to both innocent people and also those who have suffered. but when I have heard so many more stories of women who don't even make a claim as they fear someone like the guy I spoke to destroying them, not because they are lying but because of how hard it is to talk about it, stand strong, to explain the complex feelings and impact that such attacks have and not sound like you doubt yourself, to be clear and not leave room for the truth to be made to sound like lies..I believe that there is so many more case of sa and rape which lose when they shouldn't.. or who never even get there than i believe there are false claims..  so I lose faith in justice. I lose faith in the world getting better. It makes so sad. 


Edit. I hear the calls to report.i need to sleep on the discussion and decide what to do in the cold light of day. I may speak with him again when we are both sober before I decide what to do. I have, being open, a lot of very personal experiences on this topic which I need to feel comfortable are not driving me to react in  way that is not right.

Uber and Lyft Drivers: Please don't ask someone who is trapped in your car for their number.,"This happened to me a couple days ago. At the time I didn't think too much of it, but as I keep going back to it I feel more and more unsafe, because it's highlighted how vulnerable I could be while in someone else's car. Now I feel like I have to be on guard in future rides. 

When they asked if they could text me sometime, I just politely said, ""No, sorry you can't."" (Which I am proud of myself for saying so succinctly - usually I'm shy and bad at sticking up for myself and saying no). They didn't push the issue, and when I got out I even thanked them for respecting my answer. (I say ""even"" because it shouldn't be something exemplary to just respect someone's decision)

As I keep going back to it, I keep thinking of the all the things that could have gone wrong if they reacted differently. And it's made me worry that in future rides I should just try to not interact with the drivers so I don't get into this situation again, even though I really enjoy the conversations I have with people. Which also makes me sad, because I used to be someone who made eye contact and smiled with most of the people I met on the street. But years of creeps trying to latch onto me and follow me home has made me distrust the general public. So having this interaction just furthers me down the path of not interacting with people I don't already know, which makes me sad for all the others like me who wish they could feel safe simply smiling as they pass someone on the street.

I'd also like to say that this doesn't mean I think Uber or Lyft are always unsafe. These services have saved me from having to walk home in the dark many times, which is great. It's just that when someone is trapped in your car, please think of the position you put them in when you try something like this. You're putting them in a potentially dangerous situation, and likely at least uncomfortable situation, when you not only have power over their safety, but are also in a place where they can't just leave.

Why do men feel entitled to a response or attention?,"I’m really just venting, but recently, I got a pup and have been walking around my neighborhood a lot more than usual. I was walking last week in the afternoon, when out of nowhere, a guy crosses the street to talk to me. He’s nice, says he’s a vet tech and loves dogs, pets my pupper, then says “oh you’re so pretty, can I get your number?” I say no, he seems to respect it, and I’m on my way. 

Lo and behold, as I’m getting back to my apartment, I see the same guy. He comes up to me again, asks for my number again, I say no, I’m not interested. But oh no, since he’s a vet tech, he can help with my pup problems—he’s not looking for a relationship or anything! Against my better judgement, I give him my number because I’m uncomfortable and feel bad saying no a THIRD time (face palm, I know).

Anyways, he’s been messaging me every other day for the past few days to no response. Finally, today, he starts insulting me for not responding. I didn’t respond to you at all, is it so hard to take the hint? I shouldn’t have to feel unsafe just walking my dog; leave me alone. Preferably, the first time I say “no.” I don’t even feel safe blocking him in case he starts sending threats because he knows the neighborhood where I live. The worst thing is, this isn’t even the first time this has happened. I’ve had men ask for my number, and when I give them a fake one, they call it right in front of me and harass me for my real one. Just why.

A man flashed his gun at me while walking my dog last night,"I can’t post this on my neighborhood page or make a police report because the man lives a block away and could retaliate. 

My fiance and I were out walking our dogs around 9:30 last night in our neighborhood. One of our dogs stopped to poop on the devil's strip in front of a house when the owner of the house pulled up in his truck on the street next to us. We said good evening and he responded politely saying it back. My fiance picked up the poop and continued walking. The dog I was walking has stranger aggression so I waited for the homeowner to pass me on the sidewalk before following my fiance. 

Instead of walking into his house this guy puts his bags down on the walkway and turned to walk toward my fiance who had his back to him walking the opposite direction. The man got closer to my fiance and lifted up his shirt and reached into the back of his pants to grab a gun in his waist. He then turned around, saw me, let go of the gun and put his shirt back over it then walked back to his truck. I quickly got away from him and when we were about 20ft away the guy yelled at us about how our dog just shit on his plants that cost 30 dollars a piece. 

Honestly, I've never been more scared in my life. I come from a city where gun crime is pretty common and I've never seen or been threatened with a gun before. The fact that this guy felt that reaching for a gun to intimidate people walking their dogs is unbelievable to me. I am so shocked and sad that this happened and I don't know what to do about it. If I call the police I have to make a report and this guy can find us. If I post about it in our neighborhood group online this guy can find us. Just walking in the neighborhood he can figure out who we are.

I have never felt so unsafe in my neighborhood before. I found this guys tax records online and looked him up. He’s a fucking pillar of the community. Serves on multiple charity boards and is a local business owner. No one else saw the gun but me. If I reported it it would be a he said she said and I’m nobody. I live in a very conservative state and this guy is a donor to the Republicans running for office. Just so lost on what to do but wanted to vent about it. My fiancé is trying to be sympathetic but he did t see the gun. He didn’t have to worry that his fiancé was about to be shot in front of him. I don’t know, I’m just really shaken up.",TwoXChromosomes,374,1667584787.0,111,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ym5qa3/a_man_flashed_his_gun_at_me_while_walking_my_dog/
There is a rapist in my local community and no one believes the accusations. I understand why victims don't come forward.,"So the situation is basically this. 

&gt; Randy began working with Organization A late 2022 and then joined in with Organization B in 2023. Randy has and does appear 'helpful and with good intentions.' Midway through 2023, Randy informed the team at Organization B that he takes girls from the streets 'under his wing' to keep them out of harm's way and off the streets, etc. In November (2024), I (V) informed Randy I was once again working with someone I had lost contact with. Someone who Randy claimed he was previously 'watching out for and helping out' weeks prior. A young person. Randy suddenly left Organization B. Immediately disengaged with all of us and dropped contact with the group. At the time we thought this was very strange and potentially an overreaction to a conversation we had prior. What we found out (in pieces at first) was that Randy had committed despicable acts with this young person and knew that we or I would soon find out. On November 22nd, 2024, as soon as I was made aware that Randy was engaging in drug use in the form of coercion and manipulation with this young vulnerable person, I contacted Organization A. I informed Organization A (who was still working closely with Randy) that Randy was a predator. That he was dangerous and should not be trusted around vulnerable people. To keep it simple, multiple people from Organization A informed me they would discuss. I received a more official response including phrases like 'what are you asking us to do?' and essentially, 'we would like to speak with the victim.' I told them that no, this young person—the VICTIM—is not up for grabs or for discussion. If they want to continue working with him, that’s their deal. That he is dangerous, a predator, and they need to be extremely wary if they choose this. Yesterday, January 16th, I found out the extent of the abuse. The violence and the continuous assaults this young person faced in the home of Randy Meisner. In an attempt to confront him, I found Randy at an Organization A event, surrounded by the Organization A team and vulnerable people. Amidst an ugly and escalated situation, Organization A 'core' members began verbally defending Randy. 'He is important to the people here. He goes out into washes and places Organization A can’t reach and distributes for us.' 'This is inappropriate. This is unsafe.' (Geared towards me.) 'You cannot come up here and shout that someone is a rapist at our event—this is triggering,' etc. 'It’s not that simple. This is complicated.' This incident and my actions are being referred to as a 'serious accusation.' In my opinion, this is being treated like a hysteria cry. I feel incredibly invalidated for myself and this young person. Organization A has been aware of this harm (even if not in its entirety) for two months. As a community, we need to keep each other safe. And I believe sharing this warning as well as encouraging community groups to act out against predators to prevent further harm is important.

And yet people don't believe the situation. Even people on the internet aren't believing sometimes. People are just saying go to the police but what if the police don't believe? Would be so traumatic for the victim who's already went through something. And I don't think the victim wants to report because of the trauma. I don't think they want to relive that. I should point out to you that I'm not the one who initially posted this, I am not (V). So I am not in knowledge with the victim or in communication with them. But I do trust the source that I heard it from. It sounds awful. I don't know what to do because people are saying go to the police but the police aren't magic, they are ended the same biases that other humans are too. And rape is one of the harder crimes to report.

I should also point out that the person who initially posted this about 4 days after making the accusation they have had their home broken into several times within one week which is really odd and the person is suspecting although they have no proof that it could have been Randy who sent people. Randy is not some poor person, he is a person who has connections and has resources it would seem to be able to hurt people.

People expect the victim to just go to the police but they don't want to give the victim the support they need to be able to go to the police with the resources to ensure a high chance of success in the report. So of course the victim isn't going to report. 

For some reason people would rather take a chance that a guy is a rapist rather than take a chance that the accusation is a lie. What is better, being wrong that the person you're with is a rapist when he really is or being wrong that the person you were talking to was a liar and they really were? What's better, a liar or a rapist?

Even when evidence is very clear sometimes convictions don't happen. For example there have been situations where online people have been caught talking to minors in inappropriate ways and despite the fact that there are screenshots with proof they still aren't arrested.

i was followed walking my dog,"i honestly can’t even believe this just happened. it’s the middle of the day, i live in a neighborhood and many cars were passing by + a woman was outside working in her yard at the intersecting street. i generally feel very safe in this neighborhood and i’m really mad that someone tried to make me feel unsafe! 

i was walking my dog on our usual afternoon walk (note we don’t go at the same time or the same route each day because i’m a single woman living alone) &amp; i encounter two men on my walk. one walking the opposite direction as me and one just creepily staring me down standing still. i politely say hello and keep walking, i turn down a street and make it 2 houses down before my dog starts looking back and growling. to my dismay i see the man that was walking the opposite direction has turned around and decided to walk the way we were. we pick up the pace and i don’t let my dog stop to pee/snif anymore. this man continues to walk faster and gain on us, so we pick up the pace again and he does the same. i stop, directly turn around and stare at him which does not deter him. finally i pull out my phone and start recording a selfie video and intentionally capturing the background, here he ducks into a cul de sac and hangs back a minute. i come to the end of the street and can see him watching us still and slowly starting to follow again. i turn right and see a woman working in her yard and wave her down. the man comes to the intersection and just stares at me as i approach this woman and eventually decides im not an easy enough target i guess and finally heads the other direction.

I’M SO MAD! i’m not sure what the end goal was here because again it was the middle of the day, there were many cars driving by, there’s no wooded area near where we were walking and it’s a pretty populated neighborhood. in fact our public transit for the city runs through the neighborhood and at first i thought both men were waiting at the bus stop. maybe they were and the one who followed me thought he’d get a good chuckle or something. i’m not sure but i am so pissed. i guess i just came here to vent and say stay safe ladies! i intentionally only wear one earbud when i walk for this exact reason and i will be carrying pepper spray on our walks in the future.",TwoXChromosomes,477,1705342374.0,48,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/197fgqu/i_was_followed_walking_my_dog/
"I consider myself a feminist, but I'm having trouble with the street harassment issue and would appreciate some insight to help me focus my opinions a bit.","So here's the issue: I know that street harassment is a problem. I know that women feel threatened and that it stems from being objectified, etc. **I KNOW THIS AND I AGREE.**

**But that video that everyone seems to be rallying behind has left me a bit confused.** Because some of the interactions were obviously intimidating and inappropriate, but others I just felt were friendly interactions. Perhaps more forward than some are used to, but with no intention of sexualizing or objectifying.

I'm an extrovert. I'm actually a big fan of engaging with random people. And to me, there is a difference to me between harassment and being overly friendly or flirting without expectation (you know, like old men do). There is a difference to me between someone who yells ""NICE TITS"" or ""God bless your ass"" and someone who says ""Good morning beautiful lady!"" as they walk past or someone who compliments my hair or (for example this happened the other day) an article of clothing I'm wearing.

I know I know, they don't know me so what gives them the right to have an opinion on my appearance? The way I look at it, they don't know me and most of them don't expect to, but they feel like engaging randomly anyway because it's a nice boost to both sides when it's positive, so what else can they say?

When people say good morning to me, I say good morning back. If someone says I'm beautiful and moves on, I tell them they made my day and move on. I'll even sometimes compliment women and men myself if I see them walking down the street. The only response I've ever gotten is positive. They smile, or say thank you and I feel a boost to myself knowing I've made a stranger happy. I've actually even made friends this way. It's a great give and take. I know it's different because I probably don't register as a threat to the people I compliment. I know it's different. But I also get why people might think CERTAIN types of interactions are not bad things and are reluctant to stop.

**I actually even like it when people tell me to smile** (at least most of the time). And I don't think that's a product of me as a woman being brought up feeling like I have to please people. It's more something that supports my personal outlook on life. If I'm having a bad day and someone tells me to smile, I'm reminded that I have plenty of reasons to. I'm like ""You're right stranger! I'm going to kick today's ass!""

But okay, I understand some women REALLY hate that and for good reason, so I guess that's something I'm okay with people not doing anymore. But the other stuff... Does this mean our goal is to be able to walk down the street without engaging randomly with anybody ever? Even if there's no expectation and just in passing? That feels so... lonely. **I hope that's oversimplified and that someone will PLEASE correct me and clarify.**

**Now before anyone jumps on my case, I KNOW that I have a lot of privilege working for me on this.** I know that just because I've never had a particularly terrifying experience, many women have and that perhaps colors even the most benign greeting. I'm also aware that women of color are often subjected to much more aggressive harassment too. 

So maybe this is for the greater good or something that I no longer look at that kind of interaction as something to be enjoyed?

**That's why I'm struggling:** I feel like by enjoying the more non-threatening interactions, I'm like... betraying feminism or something:/ And it feels like the internet is telling me that the way I SHOULD be feeling is outraged or upset. And I just can't reconcile turning something that has only ever made my day into something that ruins it...

And then I start wondering if the fact that I compliment men and women on their appearance randomly too is actually me being part of the problem... But that doesn't feel right either:(

I dunno. **I really want to be behind this cause because I know it's a symptom of a greater problem, and I know that not everyone enjoys talking to people like I do so I can't tell people how to feel...** But I'm really struggling with how *I* feel. So I was hoping to work that out. 

Opinions?

**TL;DR** - *I am struggling because I am a feminist who really wants to be supportive of the women who want to end street harassment, but social interactions that I feel are just more overtly friendly than many people in our culture are used to (and things I do myself to be friendly) seem to be getting lumped in with sexually suggestive/aggressive comments.*

*And I, as an extrovert, I actually really enjoy the former type of interaction and am therefore having a hard time with looking at them as something that should be stopped. I feel like I have to choose between perpetuating the problem or turning something that used to empower me into something that makes me a victim. And neither of those things are something I want to do.*

*How can I find a balance?*

**EDIT:** I'd like to state for the record that **I live in Chicago, not a small town** and I HAVE experienced street harassment and am not suggesting that's not a problem. I've also experienced the kind of ""hello"" with icky subtext. I have my own strategy for dealing with those specific types of interactions that works really well for me and is the reason I'm not bothered by those so much, but as I said before, I'm definitely aware that my experience =/= everyone else's. So that's not really the point of what I was trying to discuss.

But regardless, I do genuinely appreciate the feedback. Especially from the people who actually took the time to read my whole post. 

**It was never my intention so suggest that I want other people to create an opinion FOR me.** I just wanted to hear a variety of perspectives so I could better focus my own thoughts. There have been a few people who have really put things in a way that really helped me understand and even those of you who have said things I don't agree with are helping me get a better clarity of my own opinions. So thanks!:)

Made unsafe in my neighborhood by a bunch of teenage boys,"Hello everyone,

I just wanted to share this with someone because I'm a little upset, more than I realized.

Anyway so I live in a very safe city, in a very safe neighborhood (well lit, no crime as far as I know). I run in the neighborhood, or I walk. I didn't even feel unsafe at night, though I still vastly prefer the day. (I live in Canada though so if I only walk during the day, I ain't walking past 4 o'clock in winter).

But there are these little dickheads at this one house. Late teenage years. Honestly they scare the living shit out of me right now.

 I had a very unpleasant encounter with a bunch of teens (large group, boys and girls) a few years ago. I was running, minding my own business, when two of the little cunts started taunting me, calling me fat (I'm 5'6, about 160 fyi). When I didn't pay them any attention,  they thought it would be funny to pretend to run me over with their bikes, only braking at the last minute.  Nearly had a heart attack. 

I was so shocked. I was a dumbass and I flipped them the bird. Their friends laughed and I ran away (faster). I didn't go straight home, continued my run on busier streets, checking over my shoulder all the time.

Anyway, I wasn't sure who they were then. But I am now. So I recently walked past their house and they got on their bike and started following me closely, hurling insults at me.

Okay. Lesson learnt. Not walking past their house again.

Today I was walking in the neighborhood, but not on their street. I saw a teenage boy on a scooter who was headed toward that general area and this little fucker turned so close to me as I was crossing the street that I genuinely thought he was going to run me over.

I'm scared now. I love walking and running outside. Never had an issue with it. But these assholes can be anywhere. One of them has a car. Is he going to pretend like he's going to run me over with his car?!?

What if he sees me when I'm driving? Cause an accident with me?

I have a treadmill at home so I can run on the treadmill but I need to walk outside. It's good for mu mental health. To add insult to injury, covid hasn't been good to me and I'm anxious of going most places. If I do, I pack my purse/back for literally any eventuality. Walking outside was one of the things I felt safe, that I never stopped doing.

So that's me. I just needed to vent somewhere.",TwoXChromosomes,355,1662553431.0,79,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/x83r8o/made_unsafe_in_my_neighborhood_by_a_bunch_of/
I feel unsafe going to places at night alone.,"I'm in a masters program (\~3 weeks ago I started) at an urban area after living in the suburb for most of my life. I'm pretty shy, so I haven't made any female friends and I don't have access to a car.

There are some useful academic &amp; social events I want to go to hosted by the university held after dark, I want to go but I'm scared of walking on the street alone or taking public transport back home. I wish it were normal to ask other people if you could carpool with them or if they don't really know you to accompany you. I don't know what to do. I've talked to a few people in the masters program but we don't really have a relationship so it feels wrong to ask.

What to do?

My year as a Brit in TN- rant. Still have nightmares.,"Ok so I’m new to this but I feel my experience as a Brit in Tennessee , was one of the most stressful times of my life. Decades later I have occasional nightmares about it. I also went to middle school in Chicago, it was fun. No issues. 


I’m from the uk- part of my degree was going to an American university. I put various universities down but got sent to one in TN. I was in my third year. 



List of things that will stay with me: 


What will live with me until I die. The racism. I got I watched what would happen to my friends when we went out. I couldn’t actually believe how racism seemed to be acceptable to so many. I literally got told to not ‘ make a fuss” by my friends as that was the way it was. The racism was the subject of 90% emails back to my uk university. There was an informal apartheid going on. It was crazy.


By the way, every person who harassed me or tried to hurt me was white American. UK is not perfect. It’s a different type of racism here so I’m told. I can’t speak to it as I’m white. But I see it here as well. 



Refused birth control by campus healthcare thing due to being 20. Had letters from my dr in the uk. Called a liar , had to go to I think a planned parenthood place. Obviously got called names as I walked in. 


Party- got dragged into a room by a man I didn’t know. I threatened to glass him, I was released. 

Got put in a headlock by another American guy who tried to move me to an empty room. My Swedish friend , who was like a Viking, saved me. Humiliated the attacker by picking him up shaking the living shit out of him. Me and Swedish guy are still friends. 


Got told by a prof that I needed to stay in America to mate and improve the gene pool. Then he wrote a letter to my uni in the uk saying how wonderful I was if not a little distracting due to my eyes. My university in the uk freaked out and various things were said. 


 Stopped an American guy from strangling a friend of mine. You see he had “ church in the morning “ 



Got pushed into a bathroom stall and had my roommate ( American ) try and kiss me. I rejected her and for my troubles she put up posters round campus calling me a whore. She then would try and get into bed with me- so yeah things were not great. 



Had the apartment I lived in trashed as the french I lived with . She lost  it one night after she came in to find American room mates having sex. Apparently lots of guys there, she felt unsafe and raged to get them to stop. They wanted her to join in so she basically threw whatever she could at them. Place was trashed when I got back in. She was holding a knife terrified. Told me what happened. 



Got told by the international welcoming people that they were thinking about making international students wear something to mark them as such. Armbands were mentioned. At all times. I was sat next to a German guy, he and I shared a look and he stood up and said “ listen to me, this doesn’t end well”  I then stood up and said I’d leave, didn’t care as I’d still graduate. They were shocked. Tried to threaten me, I was 20 and brought up by my grandmother who grew up during the blitz. Basically I was taught to take no shit. So I didn’t. 



Working in the library, during the day some random guy came over flashing his dick at me then started trying to pleasure himself. I picked up the biggest book I had and said “ come here I’m going to batter you” ended up chasing him. No idea what I’d have done if I caught him.  Security got to him. I got told I was reckless by the campus cops. Maybe. But also fuck that. In the library in the uk my biggest problem was not chatting to friends. 



I got back to the uk in one piece. My friends at other American universities had similar experiences We fed this back to our various personal tutors. 9 American universities that we partnered with were dropped. 



Now nearly twenty years on, whenever my fellow international student friends chat, more harassment stories come out. We are bonded by a shared trauma in some cases. Same with others who did the same course. 



Obviously awful things happen in the uk. But the most unsafe I’ve felt as an adult was in TN.

I finally understand the safety issues that women have to go through...,"Yesterday only about two hours ago I had the biggest scare of my life in regards to my personal safety when I was going for a run.  *Context I am a transgender woman who is 10 months into her transition.*

I started my run at 11:45PM around a lake in an office that I specifically chose because I wrongly **thought** it was a safe place to run in at the times I normally run due to work, it being a pretty pleasant looking view, and it being exactly a mile around the paved lake path.  

* When I was about half way around the lake(the furthest from my car possible) 200 feet ahead a guy came from behind a tree and stood in the middle of the path, I shifted to the grass to keep a good distance from the guy just in case.  
* As I got closer a huge German Shepherd comes running at me from behind the tree along with another guy.  
* I in the most gruff, angry, and masculine voice I could muster yell ""what the fuck are you doing!"".  
* When I said that the guy not on the path tells the dog to back off and he says ""don't worry, he won't bite you"", and then they started walking back to a truck that was on and running nearby in the parking lot.  
* After there was sufficient space for me to pass with me feeling ""safe"" I ran back to my car what had to be the fastest half mile I have run since I was in high school track. 

*I am 100% certain that the only thing that stopped those two guys from kidnapping me was them hearing my voice and realizing that I am transgender and ""not a real woman""*  I'm really glad they didn't decide to do anything else which was certainly possible.  

I ended up calling my boyfriend as soon as I got home and talking to him about it.  He didn't realize what area I would run in at the time I did and ended up buying me some pepper spay that will be hear on Saturday.  He told me he wants me running in my apartment complex or in residential neighborhoods.  I realized that the area I was running in is not safe at all at night because it was an office complex at night with no people who could have heard if anything happened.  The biggest reason I would run around there in the past rather than my apartment complex is so there wouldn't be people who would see me who I would ridiculously feel would judge me for being trans. 

**I truly realize that women have to deal with issues in regards to safety that men generally do not.**  I used to dismiss this fact when my sister would say she has had scares when living in downtown Chicago.  I realize why women would cross the street to avoid walking past me at night when I presented as male.  *Its because their fear is not unfounded and most if not all have had similar experiences what just happened to me.*  ***It sucks that there are monsters out there who create this fear.***

Edit: Many people have have asked why I in the past have been dismissive of my sister's similar experience(s).  The reason is she has been dismissive and antagonist toward my sexual identity since high school and extremely dismissive of my gender identity since I came out to my family.  Her refusal to even try calling me by my non-deadname or pronouns, and frequent comments telling me to get a haircut(men's haircut) strays into bigotry.
I didn't want to consider her experience(s) as valid because of a strained relationship.  Both experiences are valid.

Edit2: Alright, inbox replies are disabled and I am done reading the replies.  There is victim-blaming going on because of what time and where I was running.  There is victim-shaming going on because of who I was in the past.  Worst of all there is transphobia among the commenters.

Yesterday I went to a sports bar by myself,"I did what I call my ""fuck off"" makeup (basically dark and bold), had a couple drinks (actually didn't even finish either, I just wanted a taste), watched a hockey game, and left.

No one bothered me. No one talked to me except the server, and the rather drunk couple at the table next to mine who were talking to pretty much everyone.

I kept my drinks in my line of sight. I didn't make eye contact with anyone but the server, or indicate in any way that I was interested in company.

Why do I post this?

Cuz I'm sick of it. A guy can go to a bar alone and no one bats an eye. But I do, and I get ""But that's not safe,"" ""You're asking for attention,"" ""Mind your drinks, watch your surroundings, don't engage with anyone"" etc, etc.

And I hate it. 

Why do I hate it?

CUZ IT'S TRUE. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FEEL LIKE GOING OUT FOR A DRINK BY MYSELF AND CATCHING SOME SPORTS IS A FUCKING RISK.

Yes, nothing happened, I was careful, but the fact I even need to take these things into consideration...ffs it is 2022 can't a girl just go and enjoy herself in peace.

And don't come at me with ""yeah but not at a bar."" Why the fuck not? Why is it acceptable that there are arenas where women are inherently unsafe? 

I wasn't walking down a street alone, or a dark alley, or even out late. I was in a fucking restaurant. 

I don't feel like I am truly free. And I'm so fucking sick of it.",TwoXChromosomes,416,1649541574.0,54,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/u03cxz/yesterday_i_went_to_a_sports_bar_by_myself/
"""I'm not one of those feminists that thinks all men are evil""","So frustrated after a conversation I had with a woman friend recently that I needed to vent here. We were walking down the street in my city, a big city where street harassment/catcalling are commonplace when we had this conversation:

Me: I feel like my quality of life has greatly improved since I started ignoring men on the street. I put in my headphones, look straight ahead, don't make eye contact and nobody bothers me!

Her: I don't know, what if he's asking for directions or something ? I'm not one of those feminists that think all men are evil.

Me: Not what I said, but that's interesting that's what you heard...

I just dropped the conversation after that because it was clear there's no getting through to her and I didn't feel like unpacking the ""Not one of those feminists"" comment. Like how tf are you turning a conversation about MY personal safety and comfort in a public space into a ""Not All Men"" moment. 

For context : this is the same woman who told me I was ""too rude"" when a rando on the street asked me my name and where I was going one night and I said ""none of your fucking business.""

I HATE that women are socialized to think they owe random men anything. There's nothing wrong with being kind to strangers, but I don't see the point in being polite to men who harass women in the street. And often when I make eye contact with a man in public, they see it as an invitation to talk to me. Which I get, so I don't make eye contact to avoid uncomfortable/unsafe situations.

I can’t go outside without constant harassment!,"I literally can’t leave my house by myself without CONSTANT catcalling and harassment from men in my neighborhood. It’s making me practically agoraphobic. If I want to walk anywhere I have to plan the time of day, the streets I take, the clothes I’m wearing, when to wear headphones so I can pretend that I don’t hear catcalls but not having anything actually playing so I know when someone is pulling their car up next to me…it is so fucking exhausting. I hate when men complain about women being rude in public because they have NO idea how it feels to be this targeted, hyper visible, and unsafe.

I’ve lived in many different places and nowhere has ever been as bad as New Orleans. The audacity and entitlement of men is just fucking astounding. I just want to get my steps in, but I get anxious leaving my house at this point.

"""Are you a married woman?""","I had a weird thing happen to me last night and thought I'd reach out to my global sisters to see how you all feel about this. 


I get off work at 11pm every night. Most nights I just go right home, but I had to stop and get gas so my husband wouldn't have to leave early in the morning to fill the tank on his way to work; we were on, like, 3 miles to empty and he wouldn't have been able to make it to the gas station anyway, nor would I have been able to make it home. 


I already dislike having to stop at night, but it's even more stressful now that I'm (pretty visibly) six months pregnant, even under my puffy winter coat; I don't have just my life to worry about, and being pregnant hinders some of my ability to flee if needed. So I'm being hyper vigilant, eyeing my surroundings as I walk into the gas station. A man comes out as I'm walking in and holds the door for me, I politely say ""thank you"" and skirt past him into the station. 


I spent more than a few minutes walking around the little aisles, thinking I might bring my husband home a drink for tomorrow or snacks to take to work, then I went to wait in the line to pay for gas; I was there for a little under ten minutes, as the person at the front of the line was playing into the lottery, and for some reason those transactions always take forever. So by the time I pay and leave, it has been roughly 15 minutes since I entered.


I was almost to my car when I heard a voice say ""Excuse me"", and I looked to the car at the pump next to mine, and it was the guy who'd held the door open for me. He was sitting with a woman, I assume his wife. They were in a nice car, dressed well, but it was the woman's presence that briefly made me feel safe enough to pause and say ""Yes?"" 


Then he comes out with it: ""Are you a *married* woman?"" 


I'm gonna pause for a second here to explain that, while I may call my man my ""husband"", we are not legally married; we had a sort of ""spiritual"" ceremony where we privately, just the two of us, exchanged vows and professions of love, and I don't have a ring because I don't support the suffering that comes with the diamond industry (I also have a propensity to lose jewelry because I'm always nervously messing with my accessories if I wear them, so even a symbolic cubic zirconia would have been a waste of money). 


But something told me to confidently assert, ""Yes, I am."" 


The man nodded thoughtfully, smiled to himself, and said ""That's good...that's beautiful,"" while giving a long stare to my belly. The woman was staring at me somewhat coldly; her expression was even more unsettling coupled with the man's intense, dreamy stare


And I just had this twisting gut feeling. I mumbled something like ""Yeah it is, thank you"" and hurried towards my car, where I opened the driver's door (to have quick access inside if needed) and began pumping gas, with my back to the vehicle and eyes forward on them. They pulled away from the pump but paused in the parkway, engine running, and I could see them talking to each other through the back window--then they sped off, tires squealing and all, and merged onto the road, and disappeared down the street.


It quietly occurred to me as I was standing there that they had been waiting *fifteen minutes* for me to come out of the station so they could question my marital status--and what would have happened if I said no? Would they have lectured me about babies before marriage? Tried to talk me into giving my baby up for adoption? They looked kinda church-y, they might've flipped their shit to hear I'm legally unwed, living in sin with the father of my unborn daughter and toddler son. Or was it something more...sinister? What were they talking about before they sped off? Why *wait* for me like that, and then speed off? And why am I only safe if I either have a man with me, or make it clear that I have a man in my life? I just felt so nervous and unsafe.


I went home and told my husband about the strange encounter at the gas station, and he laughed and said ""They wanted you to be their *third*, babe; they were looking for a pretty woman to spice things up."" He didn't quite *get* the...I don't know, aspect of danger? The fear of being in that situation *at night* by myself, doing the best I could to protect both me and our daughter? It made me wonder if I was being irrational, scared for no reason. It's entirely possible that the couple was having conception problems and she felt threatened or angry at her husband's insistence to wait for me so he could stare at my stomach. But then why ask if I was *married*? I know what I felt while standing there was real, the way my stomach churned and dark chills swirled up and down my back.


I don't know. I still feel weird about it; I have this strange compulsion to keep an eye out for them, even though they didn't see me return home. What do you ladies think? Was that weird, or was it just me?",TwoXChromosomes,338,1611764278.0,71,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/l67y82/are_you_a_married_woman/
Data isn't Beautiful: A survey about harassment from the comments of yesterday's Keira Knightley post. TW.,"http://imgur.com/a/daDamYc


Yesterday u/heavymetalmater uploaded a post titled ""Keira Knightley saying every woman she knows has been groped or flashed"".

https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/nvvx86/kiera_knightley_saying_every_woman_she_knows_has/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

In the comments I started a ""survey"" where users could take part in uploading several statements. 
Those were:
""I was nice to a guy because I feared his reaction if I would reject him""
""A man flashed me or sent me unwanted dick picks""
""A man asked me for nudes""
""I take pepperspray or other self defence items with me when I go out especially at night""
""I have been made feel unsafe while walking home bc of a man""
""I have been groped""
""I have been raped""
""A man stroked his dick or masturbated in my presence in public""
""My drink was tempered with""


The results of the upvotes can be seen in the plot. The important thing is, that people could have altered the data by downvoting, therefore this has to be taken with a grain of salt. I'm still thinking about how a survey can be made where this cannot happen.


Several users also added other experiences but those have not been included in the plot as they were added later and thus not everyone will have seen them. 
They were:

""I've been followed by a man and been sexually harassed by another when he got my attention and showed me porn on his phone when we were alone EDIT: Oh and catcalled a bunch"" (u/V1bration, 15 upvotes)

""I was chased down a street by a guy who didn't know me"" (u/omniplatypus, 49 upvotes)

""A masseuse once groped my chest in a not massaging type way and kept accidentallyb touching my lips. Lika a pinky slip here and there. I still don't like massages."" (u/tedfundy, 5 upvotes)

And several other horrifying stories.

A total number of 827 people upvoted the post at the time of writing this. I am personally surprised by how high the number of people who were raped is compared to the other entries. The highest bin is the ""I have been groped"".

The plot was made using python.

Please feel free to post any statements that you would want to know about so that I can include them in potential future surveys or any idea how to do one.

Creepy guy following me around,"I just need to vent. I’m a woman in my 30s travelling interstate for work. My hotel is on the city edge, but is pretty much central to the main shopping area and where I am needed for work. I went out to the shops to get dinner last night. It was only 1 km away and I like walking. Where I’m from, most shops are open much later than here, so there’s always people around. I started to head back around 7pm, the street was mostly empty save for a couple of people here or there. As I walked, I was stopped by a man and asked where I was going and that we should have a drink. I ignored the man and kept walking. The man called me a bitch and started following me. He walked behind me back towards where I was staying and continued calling me a bitch and that I was rude for not drinking with him. I was looking for somewhere to go into to escape and walked faster, but everything closes too early here and nothing was available. I don't know the area so I didn't want to go off my route. Eventually when I got to the hotel, there was security around, so I was able to go into the hotel and escape. I felt really unsafe and I slept so badly last night. I felt uneasy leaving the building today. I want to go home.

I'm being harassed,"To give a little background:

I live on a college campus several hours away from my hometown. Earlier last month I was walking back to my dormitory in the early morning when a white van drove past me cat-calling. I assumed they were drunk fraternity boys and ignored it and crossed the street. The van then reversed into a spare lot and 4 men exited the vehicle. They had fallen silent and followed me all the way back to my dorm. I wanted to go somewhere other than my room because I didn't want them to follow me there, but there wasn't anywhere close enough for me to lose them and I was really nervous.

I told my roommate what happened and texted my best friend (who is a guy) but when he came over to help out I was really nervous around him (which was weird because I am normally really cuddly). For the next few days I was really jumpy and wouldn't let most of my guy friends near me. Something about the van had really shaken me up.

About a week later I was walking back to my dorm (again in the early morning) alone for the first time since the incident. A white van came around the corner and I immediately grabbed my phone and called my guy friend again. As the van got closer it slowed down and rolled the window down. I heard someone inside say ""Oh shit, she's on the phone!"" and the van barreled off around the corner. I was again really shaken and what they had said really scared me. What if I hadn't gotten a hold of my friend?

I told my roommate again what happened the next morning after she asked me about having some guy friends over (which I hadn't had). I had heard male voices that night too while I was trying to sleep and I thought she had friends over because (besides the voices) I definitely heard someone drop something. This put her and me on edge because we thought someone may have broken in. I went outside to check the handle and when I looked up at the door I realized the eye hole was missing out of the door and anyone could see straight into our apartment.

We called campus safety and filed reports with them as well as the police.

The night after this happened I parked my car in the lot near housing and saw a van parked in the lot. (The van is pretty distinctive, utility van, white, no windows in the back). Because my nerves were on edge I called campus safety to drive me the 500 feet to my dormitory and when the cart showed up, the van left the lot. I explained to the officer what happened and she walked me to my door.

I had thought all of this was finally over because I had not seen the van for about 3 weeks and so I was skateboarding from my car to my dorm (a pretty short distance for a college campus). I saw a white van coming at me and didn't slow down to grab my pepper spray because I just wanted to get home and was scared of losing momentum. The van passed and I thought everything was okay. Then I heard a man say ""It's been a while since I've seen those curves."" I chose to ignore it and opt for getting back to my dorm top speed. Then he said ""I know you heard me, bitch!"" and threw something at me. It hit my right shoulder. It didn't hurt, I don't know what it was (thought it sounded like an empty can when it hit the ground) I just wanted to get home as soon as humanly possible.

I got home and told my best guy friend again (my roommate wasn't there) and he came over immediately and checked the area around my apartment to make sure it wasn't anywhere around.

At this point I don't know what to do. I have pepper spray, I have been calling campus safety to drive me to my dorm whenever I am out late, and I try not to go anywhere alone. I feel really unsafe and just at a general unease and very jumpy all the time now. I talked to my family about talking to a therapist but they said that I am resilient and should not talk to a psychologist because they don't want me to relax and think I need to let my body naturally be ""on its toes"" to make sure I am aware of my surroundings.

I've never felt this scared or helpless and I honestly don't know what else to do. I haven't been able to get a plate number and there are 4 vans matching the description I gave on the street by my apartment alone.

I'm sorry for the wall of text, but if even one person can tell me something to help keep myself safe or identify the van (everything gets so adrenaline packed when I see it that I don't really register anything except the flight instinct) I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much. I am worried that I may be over-reacting, not many of my friends seem to understand why I am so frightened and keep saying that everything is alright. It just doesn't feel that way.

TL; DR - A white van of 4 men have been harassing me, broke into my apartment, and I have had to file a report for police. I feel really unsafe and don't know what to do or how to progress from here.

Edit: Hi guys. There are two things I want to include. No, I have not gotten the tag number. It was the furthest thing from my mind when I saw / when I see it. Its like my mind shuts down and all I can focus on is getting home. I also have been getting a surprising number of people saying I am lying/ they don't believe me. To those people (or people who think likewise) I am sorry you don't believe me. However, I posted here for help and ideas to keep myself safe, not your judgement or criticism. I would appreciate if you kept those things to yourself because this is hard enough to deal with without your help.

Women are literal superheroes,"**And unfortunately necessary edit:** I seem to have stepped on some fragile toes with this post and a minority of comments have made that very clear. I assure these individuals that I am properly ashamed of myself, and am pasting an excerpt from my own comment below for clarity sake.

*I'm so confused why so many people are viewing my post as an attack on men. There are two men peripherally mentioned in this post, and the worst thing I have say about the first is that we weren't right together and he took football too seriously, and the worst thing I can say about the second is that he leaves his socks everywhere and it's adorable.*

*I like men in general, and love some men in particular. They're great. This post just wasn't about them. The fact that several people have rushed to defend a gender that wasn't under attack in a post celebrating another gender says more than I care to on the matter. I also think cheese is wonderful, but this post wasn't about cheese. Where are the cheese defenders in the comments?* **#justiceforcheese**

**Original Post:**This was over ten years ago, in my last relationship before I met my husband, but I still think about it. I was at my boyfriend's fraternity, and I was *drunk.* Boyfriend's college football team lost a game that night, and he always got mean when his team lost. I forget how it started, but we got in an ugly argument outside the frat. Nothing physical, just screaming at each other before I stormed off into the night.

This is probably the stupidest thing I've ever done. I was too drunk to walk straight, I didn't know how to get home, and I was in the middle of a Greek Row that had a nasty reputation for being unsafe for women in my situation. 

And some angel just fell into step with me and took my arm to keep me from stumbling into the street. She told me that she'd seen the whole thing, that guy's a total asshole, and she was gonna get me home safe. And that's exactly what she did. This was before she could have put me in an Uber, and neither of us had a smart phone to navigate us. 

But she knew the town pretty well, walked me to the neighborhood my apartment was in, and wandered with me until I found my place. When we got there she told my roommate what happened, made sure I was safe, put her number in my phone so I could call her if I needed anything, and left.

It's probably the kindest thing a stranger has ever done for me. I never saw her again, but I've managed to pay it forward to other women since then. I just wanted to post this to say thank you to Megan, and to all women who step up when they see a sister in a bad situation. I see a lot of posts here about the awful shit we have to put up with, but at least we have each other's backs.",TwoXChromosomes,424,1644304902.0,29,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/sne7ji/women_are_literal_superheroes/
I'm a woman being accused of non-physical domestic abuse by a man - struggling to make sense.,"*This might not be the place for this, but I felt this would be a better place from r/relationships. Also, I cannot find many resources online about women being accused by men. The following may trigger someone, and I apologize that it may. But there is no physical violence (pushing, shoving, striking, etc.) in this post. Which is part of my struggle to make sense of the accusations. However, I do make reference to my partner's sexual abuse which happened in his youth.*

---

I'm a 31F and was until recently engaged to a 33M named George. George is very sensitive, introverted, and doesn't have many friends of his own. He is career focused and very excited about having his own family in the near future. He is from a very large family from an upper middle class background. I am social and out going, and have about three living family members. I'm also excited about becoming a mother, something we talk about a lot, and have set my career up to be able to work from home 100% in the coming years. George and I are equal earners but I am from a lower-middle class family. 

We had been engaged for about 18 months, together for a total 3 years, living together for 2. George has had issues that he admits shaped his personality. Around 12-13 years old, he and other boys his age were at camp. They coaxed him into mutual touching of genitals, and when he decided to run away before things progressed more than over the clothes touching, they turned the story around on him. The boys told everyone George was gay and initiated it - something everyone believed. He never bothered telling anyone the real story, including counselors, his brother who was in a different part of the camp, or his parents. He lost all of his friends. In college, he actively avoided making friends with anyone because of the trauma. He was self-effacing about going to class, going to his after-school job, and avoiding people completely. Being a STEM major in a mixed college, I guess this wasn't surprising to other students.

Although handsome and charismatic, George never had sex until he was 32, when we began dating. He blames this not on his abuse but on his lack of making connections with anyone - platonic or otherwise. However, he seemed devoted to make a change - hence our relationship. We met on eHarmony, and hit it off immediately. He told me he joined because he realized he was always going to be alone unless he did something about it. I appreciated his honestly. I joined to find a more ""serious"" relationship after two previous ones went no where with men who didn't want to have a family.

I accepted his lack of sexual and relationship experience. In hindsight, maybe I shouldn't have. I didn't look at him as something to ""fix"" but rather as a person who got dealt a crappy hand, and was trying to figure life out. We were compatible in every other aspect, and I really liked him. Being so upfront about the abuse made me feel confident this wasn't someone who needed to be saved, rather he was someone who needed a chance to shine.

He is thoughtful, chivalrous, and has his own sense of humor. We are also best friends. But he is a very fearful person. This isn't apparent to everyone but he is super emotional. All of my friends have seen him cry, whether it's a movie or a sad story. It's not something anyone mocked him for, but it did strike me as a bit off. Female friends were usually impressed by how ""in touch"" he was with emotions while still being a big strong man.

I have seen him have emotional breakdowns about his fears several times. These manifest almost as panic attacks, where he cannot breathe or stop crying. They usually come on after bad news (death of a family member, I began to lose my hearing in one ear) or a setback in his career. 

I have always stood by as his support. I never looked at this as a warning sign or red flag. He has a complicated relationship with his parents for several reasons including his parents forcing him to go to college instead of just ""figuring it out"" and also his deep rooted fear of his father. Although his parents have no idea about the sexual abuse, he blames them for not nothing ""somehow."" I don't understand but I never pushed because I don't know how it feels to deal with that type of trauma. I honestly don't know if the fear of his father is from a specific thing, or just an overarching issue as his dad was very tough on him, traveled extensively when George was young, and is not a loving person.

Two months ago, George told me for the first time he's afraid of me and he feels he has to walk on eggshells around me. I was absolutely stunned and felt like garbage instantly. But as we talked about it, I didn't understand what he felt he couldn't bring up around me. He used the example of me ""freaking out"" when he ruined an heirloom piece of furniture. 

I travel for work, and he was home in our apartment for a week and a half. Before I left, I asked him to move the herb garden plants we had just purchased off the table when he had the new permanent area clear. But when I got back, he had left them there and had been over watering them, soaking through the table cloth and completely warping the wood underneath.

Seeing the damage I wept. Seriously wept. The plants were also dead from over-watering. I then (I think understandably) started to yell ""why did you leave them (the plants) here? I reminded you from Chicago to move them - you said you did! Why did you lie? How did you not see the water dripping!?"" and the like. He didn't have much to say other than he'd find a way to fix it and was sorry. I didn't speak to him the rest of the night since he said nothing but ""I'm sorry"" and ""I'll fix it somehow"" in a flat tone.

Flashback to him telling me he's afraid of me - he said at that moment he was afraid of me because I was yelling. I view myself as a considerate partner. I didn't dismiss or deflect his feelings but I have to admit, I was saying ""are you effin' serious?"" in my brain. I explained how upset I was and he countered that the heirloom table was ""just a thing"" not a person, and how his feelings were ignored. He also said it was abusive that I didn't speak to him the rest of the night.

He then brings up my ""depression."" My mother died when I was 10. Christmas is always a rough time of year. This year, since I was hosting the holiday for the first time, I was especially upset. I cried, spent more time alone reading than watching TV with George, but also opened up to George more than ever. I say ""depression"" because while these feelings are strong, I handle them. I didn't skip work or avoid friends. I had a great time being the hostess, and I cried a little that day, but it was more like - wow, I've come a long way and Mom would be proud. But George said that it was bigger than I was admitting to. He suggested I see a therapist. I didn't say anything. He asked if I would be open to it, and I said I would think about it, but I didn't see it as something that interfered with my life.

He also said the ""eggshells"" thing was an everyday issue. He reminded me of a recent Saturday when he forgot to get our dry cleaning. He said he was afraid all day of my reaction. When I asked where he put the dry cleaning because I wanted to wear a dress that needed to be picked up, he sheepishly said he never got it. I said, ""what? (sigh) okay, I'll find something else."" I picked something out, finished getting ready and when I walked back to see him he was upset. He said he was so scared of disappointing me and he was hoping I didn't need the dress. I said, ""so you knew I'd be disappointed and instead of telling me 'hey, I forgot to get the cleaning' you just waited all day."" He didn't really have an answer.

Flashback to him telling me he's scared, he explains that he's so afraid of disappointing me because then I'll ""withhold my love."" In his mind, me walking away to find another dress was me withholding love. I tried to defend myself, but he started saying I was blaming him and how that was part of the cycle of abuse.

So, we set rules up for ""fights."" He would tell me if he felt threatened or scared, and if I felt like I was losing my temper, I'd leave the room for 5 or 10 minutes. 

Last month, we began to have a fight about our upcoming wedding. He had a problem with his parents, and immediately wanted to elope, as to spite them. I didn't, and tried to talk sense into him. He was worried that some members of his extended family didn't like me. I said - trying to be a bit funny - if 4 or 5 of the 215 people we're inviting don't like me, they can RSVP no or come and give us a gift! He turned on me and began to accuse me of wanting money out of his very large and very rich family. 

I reminded him we were paying the wedding and we would never ever break even, and I said it was insulting. He continued to call me everything short of a social climber - this has never ever been an issue before. I got up from our living room and said, ""leave me alone, I need to calm down."" When he said no, let's talk about this now, I said ""fuck you, leave me alone. You have no idea how mean you are.""

I went into the office and closed the door. He opened it and continued to say I was after money. I lost my temper, stepped towards him (still about 3 feet away) yelling and waving my hands at my side (think karate chop, with my elbows close to my torso) saying, ""Are you fucking kidding me!? This is what you think of me!?"" He jumped back. I continued by saying I don't care who doesn't like me, this wedding is for us! He just stared at me, so I sat down at my desk exasperated. I heard his coat zip up, and he said he was leaving me. 

He said he's physically scared of me. He said that yelling **WILL** lead to me striking him. He kept repeating that he'd never let me make him scared again as he was crying. I started crying and apologized. I walked towards him and he quickly told me not to come near him. I obliged, and asked if I could hug him, he kept telling me to stay away so I did. He said there's something wrong with me and that I'm ""so scary."" 

I begged from him to stay, or to go out for a walk and come back, or I'd leave for a few hours. Nothing. He then said ""why didn't you see a therapist?"" I responded that I thought things were good, things were better! I brought up that I walked away from the fight, and he came into the office - he stopped me and said I was blaming him for my ""abusive behavior.""

He left for his parents. The next day he texted me saying he needed some time. I said I loved him and I wanted him to come home when he was ready. A few days later, he asked me to be out of the house for a bit so he can get things he needed for work. When I came back, he took every piece of his property except for things I gave him like three years of handmade Christmas gifts. He lied to our landlord and said he was putting things in storage, but he left the key under the mat. 

I called him and he said he was never coming back. I convinced him to meet with me, but he told me we could only meet at a coffee shop in public. He explained that I'm an abuser, we are toxic, I put us into a cycle of abuse, and nothing will ever get better in his life unless he leaves. He fears for his safety. I tell him I love him, and I said we could see a therapist. He said the time had come and gone for that, and that I need therapy. I carefully asked him if he was being irrational about the fear, and if that he was going to see a therapist. He then told me he calls the Domestic Abuse and Violence hotline several times a day and uses the chat function for support and has no plans to see a psychologist / therapist. He was adamant I am unsafe to be around.

All of my friends, ""our friends."" and most of ""his friends (coworkers)"" have completely sided with me. Some people blame me for causing his breakdown. Others tell me I need to reach out and help him. The accusations of abuse have prevented me from contacting him. I left him a voicemail saying nothing but how much I loved and missed him but I never heard back. Our friend met up with him and he cried for an hour about how scared he is and that he loves me, but I'm ""deeply wounded"" and that I'll never be better.

His family completely blocked me on social media and unfriended me. I was very close to his mother, we spoke two or three times a week as she has only sons and my mother has passed on. I reached out twice, she simply responded: ""You have to move on,"" both occasions.

I did start seeing a therapist twice a week. I have read pages and pages about abuse especially verbal. While there's things I wish I could take back, the therapist and I both agree it was not verbally abusive. She also helped me realize that we all have the capacity of being abusive, but that doesn't mean it can't change instantly with better attitudes and support.

We have an apartment lease, financial obligations regarding the wedding, a joint savings account, and other things like utilities that need to be solely in my name. He will not respond to any emails. I reached out to his parents about these issues, who responded that they would be coming to my apartment to reclaim my engagement ring (State law where I live - the ring goes back, it means nothing to me regardless.) 

*My reason for posting is simple ... is this a complete overreaction on his part? Or are yelling and outbursts truly abuse?*

I validate his feelings, I've never called him stupid or fat or a failure. He has a sexual dysfunction issue (delayed / retarded ejaculation) that I supported him through seeing a sex therapist. My part of the therapy plan involved having sex in ways I wasn't thrilled about (mutual masturbation, completely in the dark) but I did to make our love stronger, and help his issue. And it seems now the past 4-5 months, he's just become completely afraid of me for what I consider appropriate reactions (yelling when someone says you're just trying to get money, crying and yelling when someone destroys something important to you, being disappointed when someone breaks their word to you). Also, telling me I'm deeply wounded because of my dead parent is absurd to my sensibilities.

My brain says that this man has an issue / problem that is not my fault, and that it's good I realized it now and not later when we had children, a home, and more entanglements.

But my heart says I could've done more since I knew how sensitive he is. I feel like I pushed him away and ruined the happy life we had. And I was happy.

I'm moving on and I no longer have hope for him to ""snap out of it"" or at least come to the realization he's not a domestic abuse victim. But for the first time, I feel like I'm not in a good place mentally. That I'm messed up and I ruined our life together and future with my yelling.

My therapist categorizes my behavior as healthy and had me read this article 
[Martha Beck on ""Impotent Rage"" - Oprah.com](http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Martha-Beck-Impotent-Rage) to show that we were opposites in how we deal with anger. But I can't shake the feeling that this is my fault, and I'll ruin another relationship. I'm trying to work on this.

Recently posted on this subreddit was this article, [13 Questions to Ask Before You Get Married - NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/23/fashion/weddings/marriage-questions.html?_r=0) and I felt kind of stupid - because we discussed 12 of these and more ... except number 1. I feel like since he's from a closed up / cold family, he doesn't realize yelling isn't necessarily abuse. It bothers me that we knew exactly what we'd do if we had a sick child, which religion we'd practice, and how to handle money, but in hindsight we didn't have a baseline of emotional understanding. 

**TL:dr - Ex-fiance is claiming he is a victim of domestic abuse; claims he's in constant fear of me physically hurting him because I yell. Any experiences or insight?**",TwoXChromosomes,33,1459201365.0,175,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/4ccc2b/im_a_woman_being_accused_of_nonphysical_domestic/
I have to put on a chest death trap just to feel safe in public,"*i.e. bras

During the pandemic, I suddenly just stopped wearing bras. Having small boobs, there was no point for me being at home all the time. On the rare occasion I left my house for errands, it still didn’t matter because I was wearing a giant snow jacket. 

Once the pandemic ended, I kept not wearing them because I was used to it and didn’t really care that much. I attended classes, met with friends/etc and it never came up or seemed to matter at all. I donated a few bras since it seemed like I wouldn’t be needing them anymore. 

Well now it’s midsummer, so I’ve finally shed my sweaters and started wearing t-shirts or tank tops. And holy shit, I am being ACCOSTED in the street. It’s not just passing glances - these I can understand, because braless boobs are semi unusual and might stick out from the crowd. I get these looks glances from men and women of various ages, sometimes accompanied by judgement, shock, or appeal. 

What bothers me is people who STOP IN THEIR TRACKS to fully, openly STARE at my chest. Wide eyed, shameless goggling. 

It’s always the same demographic - extremely old white men. I’m talking over 60. Guys my age seem to have the decency to look away if they catch my eye or at least at embarrassed. Not these older guys though. 

On top of it all, this is on busy public streets in broad daylight with my boyfriend right next to me.

These past few summer weeks, Ive started feeling completely on edge and unsafe, particularly if I had to be alone or it was at night. If men can be so open to gawking at my body like it belongs to them, who knows when one of these fuckers would take it one step further. 

So, today I put on a bra. For the first time in almost two years. It sucks and feels uncomfortable. But no one has stared at my chest! And that brings me a sense of security. 

This sucks. I hate the patriarchy. I hate men who do this. Why can’t I wear what I want without fear of literally being attacked??",TwoXChromosomes,90,1651259826.0,63,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/uetb0s/i_have_to_put_on_a_chest_death_trap_just_to_feel/
My Sister is Now Scared of the Outside World,"My parents recently told me (32m) that my 20y/o sister was almost abducted about a week and a half ago.

My mom had bought her a dash cam when she got her new car after she was involved in an accident. The story goes that she went to a Target nearby, and backed into a parking spot. She went in, came out and as she drove off her tire went flat. So she pulled into the parking lot of a restaurant nearby. Another car had pulled in that she recognized from the parking lot at Target.

The man approached her asking if she needed help as she was checking out the tire. My parents only lived 5mins away and my step dad is a mechanic so he was on his way which she told the stranger. He walked into the restaurant and walked out in a matter of seconds with nothing in hand. My step dad arrived on the scene and chased him off.

Well, the footage on the dash cam in conjunction with the footage from the cameras in the Target parking lot, further corroborated by what my step dad had found when he was checking out the tire was that the man had went to his trunk for a tool, crouched down by my sisters car and pulled the core out of the tire valve… all the while in a brightly lit and bustling Target parking lot.

The police were involved, my sister has a highly photographic memory when giving details, picked the guy out of a lineup, but hasn’t heard word from the detective since.


They live in a suburb a bit outside of Chicago right next to the interstate with an interchange that one can use to get to the city, Indiana or Wisconsin...

My parents told me she’s basically afraid to leave the house at all alone. Which while incredibly disheartening and unfortunate is entirely understandable.

They also bought her pepper spray too. A family friend suggested she get a FOID card and firearm which I and my parents believe to be more of a danger for many reasons...

I gave her advice such as if: if she has to pull over to do so in a well lit area, and always put your hazards on. Which isn’t really great as even our own neighborhood has like 1 street light at the main intersections; that she never turn her back on a stranger that is directly approaching her, to keep her distance and get in her car to lock the doors if she is able; if she has to run to never look back as that makes it a liability she could trip or run into something that would slow her down. 

Even when interacting with cops that she needs to be careful as they’re likely to abuse their authority unless you’re a white male; never step out of the vehicle, and if asked to do so, she needs to ask why and if she’s being detained; to only open her windows a bit to communicate and pass along documents.


Was this good advice, and is there any other advice I can provide her? 

I also feel that while the advice is necessary for her safety, it’s worsened her fear... what can I do or say to console her without sugarcoating the reality of the situation and society?",TwoXChromosomes,54,1727530067.0,14,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1frean5/my_sister_is_now_scared_of_the_outside_world/
"There was a group that I know about that I don't know what to do in this situation there is a group that I know about that I don't know what to do in this situation (TW: sexual assault, coercion)","So for some backstory organization a is an organization that helps distribute medical-based supplies to needy people an organization b is an organization that helps distribute similar stuff but also distributes more household or personal items to homeless people. So they are both organizations that help out people in need. I should also point out that all of the first person pronouns are not referring to me, it's referring to the original poster which I transcribed here.

&gt; Randy began working with Organization A late 2022 and then joined in with Organization B in 2023. Randy has and does appear 'helpful and with good intentions.' Midway through 2023, Randy informed the team at Organization B that he takes girls from the streets 'under his wing' to keep them out of harm's way and off the streets, etc. In November (2024), I informed Randy I was once again working with someone I had lost contact with. Someone who Randy claimed he was previously 'watching out for and helping out' weeks prior. A young person. Randy suddenly left Organization B. Immediately disengaged with all of us and dropped contact with the group. At the time we thought this was very strange and potentially an overreaction to a conversation we had prior. What we found out (in pieces at first) was that Randy had committed despicable acts with this young person and knew that we or I would soon find out. On November 22nd, 2024, as soon as I was made aware that Randy was engaging in drug use in the form of coercion and manipulation with this young vulnerable person, I contacted Organization A. I informed Organization A (who was still working closely with Randy) that Randy was a predator. That he was dangerous and should not be trusted around vulnerable people. To keep it simple, multiple people from Organization A informed me they would discuss. I received a more official response including phrases like 'what are you asking us to do?' and essentially, 'we would like to speak with the victim.' I told them that no, this young person—the VICTIM—is not up for grabs or for discussion. If they want to continue working with him, that’s their deal. That he is dangerous, a predator, and they need to be extremely wary if they choose this. Yesterday, January 16th, I found out the extent of the abuse. The violence and the continuous assaults this young person faced in the home of Randy. In an attempt to confront him, I found Randy at an Organization A event, surrounded by the Organization A team and vulnerable people. Amidst an ugly and escalated situation, Organization A 'core' members began verbally defending Randy. 'He is important to the people here. He goes out into washes and places Organization A can’t reach and distributes for us.' 'This is inappropriate. This is unsafe.' (Geared towards me.) 'You cannot come up here and shout that someone is a rapist at our event—this is triggering,' etc. 'It’s not that simple. This is complicated.' This incident and my actions are being referred to as a 'serious accusation.' In my opinion, this is being treated like a hysteria cry. I feel incredibly invalidated for myself and this young person. Organization A has been aware of this harm (even if not in its entirety) for two months. As a community, we need to keep each other safe. And I believe sharing this warning as well as encouraging community groups to act out against predators to prevent further harm is important.",TwoXChromosomes,0,1739103400.0,11,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ildhj5/there_was_a_group_that_i_know_about_that_i_dont/
Trader Joe’s,"Inspired by the earlier post about poorly behaved men at Epcot, I wanted to share about my experience. This was 15 years ago. 

A student at the Art Institute in Chicago, I lived in the dorms downtown. There was Jewel Osco and Trader Joe’s within walking distance and at the time I was pretty broke, so I typically walked the shorter distance to Jewel Osco (coupons!) Trader Joe’s was a special treat “worth the walk,” ya know? It was only a train stop away though, so when I had money to spend and low energy I did that. I took the train and splurged a little bit. 

I don’t remember the name of the stop, but it was underground. I was with a friend, another woman, and as we were walking up the stairs to street level I felt someone behind me grip my whole crotch with a hand, and then run that hand very quickly and not gently all the way back to my asshole. I shrieked “WHAT THE FUCK?!” and whipped around to see who’d done that, and some 20 people casually walked past me like I was in their way. In that instant I knew whomever it was it was one of these people, so I shouted to me friend “somebody just grabbed my ass” as loudly as I could. I don’t know what I expected. 

Everyone went on about their business. I can’t even remember their faces. I just walked across the street and into Trader Joe’s and never spoke about it again. ",TwoXChromosomes,27,1742613529.0,5,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1jgz9et/trader_joes/

About an incident this morning.. A PSA for you girls and guys.,"I recently began going to college in a city that is known for being a bit more on the rough side. Unfortunately my college campus is near the bad part of town. My husband and I agreed to get me some pepper spray just in case.

So the main building at school where I park has a walkway between the school building and a church that you can walk through to get to the main road. Two guys started catcalling me and shouting at me (keep in mind I’m walking alone in an alleyway) and getting all close so I pulled out my spray and told them to back off.

One of them says he’s gonna call the cops and have me arrested. I told him he’s an idiot if he thinks that’s ever going to happen. So they start going off about how they’re just trying to be friendly and nice. I told them that saying “look at you, baby” and “wow you’re a cute one” isn’t being nice, it’s being fucking creepy and makes me feel unsafe. Long story short they called me a slut and a whore as I was walking away because they’re insecure pricks.

Yes, this was in the morning during daylight hours. Yes, there were people around. This kind of thing can happen anytime/ anywhere.

I was pretty shaken up after the incident and called my husband first, followed by the police station to report the incident. My teacher (an amazing guy) was incredibly supportive and is walking me back to my car after class.

So, PSA ladies (!!and men!!), always have some kind of protection with you especially when in a bad part of town. You never know when you might need it and hopefully you never will need to use it.


Edit: I wasn't aware that this would be so split down the middle, so let me put some more info out there:

* Yes, I was in an alleyway. No, I shouldn't have to avoid walking to the street from my parking spot. That's ridiculous. Maybe instead of blaming me for taking the same path I do twice a week and never had an incident on until today, people should be decent and not threaten somebody just walking. There's a stellar idea!

* Also, about threatening, yeah I did feel threatened. I don't feel like I overreacted because **I was alone in an alleyway and two men were saying vile things and approaching me**.

* I would like to apologize for not including that this was in America and in some countries carrying pepper spray is illegal. I would like to stress (as many other have as well) that it is important to check your local law enforcement agency to see if you can carry a defensive weapon.

* Yes, I am allowed to have pepper spray in the school as long as it is concealed and obviously not used or taken out during class.",TwoXChromosomes,67,1488381864.0,94,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5wwiov/about_an_incident_this_morning_a_psa_for_you/
Dude with his dick out,"Tonight, I (36F) was making dinner in the kitchen - windows facing the street, we're the corner house. A youth (late teens/early 20's?) walked along the cross street. I noted him with a passing glance then returned to my task, not unusual to have pedestrians, and youths as 3 blocks up is a park with a basketball court.

Next time I look up, he's sitting on the corner, kitty-corner, newly wearing a blue surgical mask, maybe staring at me. Odd. But there's been a lot of activity on our dead-end block this week. New neighbors are doing extensive hardscaping, perhaps that's caught his eye. No, it seems he's staring at me. He makes to walk up our street - ok, maybe he ***is*** going to look at the hardscaping. Back to stir fry.  And, now he's sitting tucked behind a car across the street, facing my window directly. Pants pulled down, dick in hand, staring straight at me while in motion. Def took me a second to register what was going on. 

My husband went out to yell at him, kid kept peeking at me from behind the car. I called the cops, felt super conflicted, like he's a horny kid, maybe, but also this is like, not ok. He left shortly after that, running off with his basketball. Cops did nothing, as to be expected for calls like this. 

I initially shrugged it off. Reflected on how many times dudes have been lecherous with their dicks out. Like, no big deal it's a thing that happens. 

Age 12 - walking around Target with a friend, older guy making laps with his dick hanging out. Naive us thought maybe he didn't realize? Giggled and that was that. Cops showed up as we were leaving the store, took me a bit to piece that one together. 

Age 21 - 4 am, my girlfriends and I piling into my car after a night out, dude suddenly appears next to the car. Dick out shaking it at us. Spead off into the night screaming and laughing. 

Shit happens. Boys will be boys, right? :/ 

My thought process tonight has been wild, like, why is this a thing that happens? And how fucked is it that initially, I shrugged it off as - meh, part of being a woman?  


The unsettled and fear-based thoughts are starting to show up. Delayed trauma, likely. I don't want to feel unsafe in my home. Someone smarter than me knows the stats about % of incidents like these that escalate. I hope that isn't this. 

This kid definitely lives in our neighborhood. We're introverts and keep to ourselves, but notice the packs of youths that regularly pass the house along the way to the basketball court. We know he's one of them. 

House is locked. Gates are locked. Shades are drawn. Husband is researching home security cameras (hope to ***not*** identify a trend or frequency). I'm imagining building a 9ft fence around the entire perimeter of our yard (remote driveway gate + climbing flowering vines = so quaint and safe). Fack.

Rethinking My Aggression Towards Men (TW Violence),"Hello,  
  
Long-time lurker here, unfortunately having something to contribute.  
  
A man smashed a pint glass into a woman's head/face, about three feet away from me, at a bar this Friday night.  
  
I saw the incident play out from start to finish, and I can't help but think, could that have been me?

I don't drink, so it's quite rare that I even go to bars, but I went out for a friend's birthday. I was the only woman out of a group of about 9. We were at a local dive. The vibe was good, albeit a bit dull for a Friday. The crowd was majority men, mostly dancing in little clusters, and generally presenting as queer.

This meant one guy stood out from the crowd (henceforth referred to as Creep). Creep was dancing too close to one of my male friends, being touchy and hovering, in a way that seemed to indicate being high on coke or ecstasy, which was not at all the vibe of anyone else around us. This bar sometimes has losers who hover, but you can quite easily dodge them and find your own space. He was not taking the non-verbal ""No"" for an answer.

We were making fun of him here and there, commenting to one another about the his weird vibe, as he continued to linger too close to us. Creep wordlessly asked my friend for the shot he'd just bought, gesturing to it. My friend shrugged and gave the guy the shot, who offered it to me. I made a face of disgust and gestured, ""Nope,"" which gave him pause. He looked offended, but downed the shot, and continued to dance around us. We all laughed it off -- weird drunk guys, eh? No reason to feel unsafe, there were almost ten guys there to protect me.

After a couple more minutes of trying to chat with my friends whilst dodging Creep, I pulled the birthday boy close and let him know,  ""I'm just gonna squeeze in here between you guys,"" nudging between him and another friend, my back pressed against the bar.

I saw the next part play out like a movie scene:  
*Oh, he's dancing way too close to that woman.* He's practically grinding against her, out of nowhere. She turns her head to talk to him. *Yep, she's telling him off.* He looks offended, and says something. She slaps him in the face, and without hesitation, **he slams his pint glass against her face.**

The next part was somewhat a blur. I ducked into the dish pit. The sight (blood) and sound (shattering) are still so vivid. A scuffle breaks out on the floor, as people grab the guy. She enters the dish pit and she's rinsing her face. I felt like I was in a nightmare. I made a beeline for the coat check and got multiple blocks down the street before I came down from the adrenaline high.

I learn later on, from a friend who chased down the guy when he tried to get away, that the cops busted Creep , and the woman is okay, looked after by the paramedics and perhaps not even going to need stitches. She will heal physically; I can't speak to how she will navigate this situation emotionally.

This incident has left me with feelings of dread. Besides the solid 24 hours straight of constantly replaying the smash in my mind, I am certain that this so easily could have been me.  
  
I am the kind of woman who will tell off any man who is making me feel unsafe. I've pushed men full force out of mosh pits when they were being overly aggressive. Yelled at men who cat-called me, not considering my safety (or lack thereof) in the moment. I am petite and easy to take down, yet my pride makes it impossible for me to walk away, when I feel that someone is trying to overpower me without having any right to.

However, I am worried that I have, many times and without realising it, valued my pride more than my safety. More than my life.

This validated so many of my instincts and fears: that I was right to get the hell away from this guy; that people can lose their mind at absolutely any second, and you never know what you're up against; that a predator can and will act on impulse when in pursuit of their prey.

**When reacting with violence to acts of sexual harassment and abuse, overt or otherwise, we need to expect escalating violence in return.**

Many women would see a slap as having an impact equal to being sexually harassed. But the response from this man was further proof that the playing field is far from level. I'm not justifying violence, but surely, any rational person could imagine that if your mom or sister was called a bitch and groped by some random dude, wouldn't you find it permissible for her to slap him in the face?

The more that men forcefully paint our experiences with varying shades of sexual violence, responding with escalating violence when they face backlash, expect that more and more women are going to simply remove themselves from any given situation.

I very well could have ended up in the position that woman was in. I had been getting close to finally just telling him to fuck off, because I am the kind of woman who stands up for herself. Except that night, I was instead conflict-avoidant, relying upon other men to protect me from one of their own.

I will  be reclaiming my space and hitting up this bar again, to erase the shitty memories this loser has etched into my mind. But when it comes to defending myself, in the future, I might just walk away instead. Because you never know when some psycho, fragile man is going to have a reaction that changes your life forever.",TwoXChromosomes,17,1739171429.0,4,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1im0fyv/rethinking_my_aggression_towards_men_tw_violence/
I'm going to grow my hair out,"I used to have very long pink hair down to my butt. Then I was assaulted one too many times and developed a strong aversion to anything that made me feel feminine because it felt unsafe. I stopped wearing colourful, fitted clothes. Anything that drew attention to me. Only dark, loose fitting. And i got all of my hair chopped off to a pixie. I let it go back to boring brown.

This has been the case for about 3 years now. The biggest thing I noticed in this time is that it had the exact effect I wanted it to - I became invisible to men. I went from being harrassed multiple times a week on the street and public transport, to absolutely nothing. I have not had a single interaction with a man I don't know in 3 years. I don't know for sure if it's that they think I'm a man, or if I'm just ugly/unattractive to them. But it has been blissful and really helped with my hypervigilance. 

Recently though I have realized that I don't look at myself in the mirror anymore. I get this feeling of ""what's the point?"". I feel no connection to how I look. I feel like I only have half a personality. I really do feel invisible. So I've decided I'm going to let my hair grow back out (and then dye it). I'm going to wear cute dresses. It might sound trivial but this feels like a big deal and I'm honestly scared. I'm worried that as soon as I look feminine again they'll see me and I'll be attacked again. But I'm trying to be brave and I'm proud of myself 🌞

"I’m so sad, y’all","I really am. I fought the good fight in Michigan. I canvassed my ass off.  

Want to know what I learned? I learned that my value lies in what I look like, particularly with men.  The men I canvassed with. The men whose doors I knocked.  The men I encountered on the street cat calling me, and asking me what I was doing.

I never felt unsafe. Want to know why? Because the men I encountered all appeared to have a vested interest in getting my attention and pleasing me because they were taking their shot.  I half pretended they had one, just to keep myself safe.

As a white woman in her early fifties that regularly gets mistaken for being in her 40’s, I was mostly safe.  I cannot say the same for my co-workers of color, who had dogs called on them, sprinklers turned on them, and various threats of violence made upon them, simply for having the gall to approach someone’s door.  None of this happened to me.

It’s amazing how much people will pretend to listen to you, when they think they have a shot.

What I learned is that we live in a racist country, and that misogyny rules the day.

I’m done focusing on other people.  I know where my value lies, and apparently it’s in my looks.  Thank god I recently lost some weight too - it buys me a few more years of relevancy in this sick country we live in.

But please forgive me if I don’t “smile more” for awhile.  That is going to take some time.

For self-preservation, I’ll continue to work extra hard on my looks and save up as much money as I can so I can keep up with all the plastic surgery I’ll need to keep your attention for as long as possible until you start making fun of me for trying too hard.

I think I’ll watch “The Substance” today.  Seems appropriate.

There are few things more deliberate and terrifying than a man stopping his car to ask a woman to get inside.,"Two weeks ago I had a man do a three point turn in the middle of traffic so that  he could stop next to me and ask if I need a ride anywhere. I told him no, and that I was walking in the opposite direction. He then drove around the block to intercept me on my way and ask again. I told him no, again, and looked over my shoulder the whole way to campus.

A week ago I had another man yell something at me in passing that I couldn't make out. He then parked in the street I was approaching and asked if I had a boyfriend. I told him, honestly, that I was engaged. He said ""Oh, sorry,"" and drove away.

Just now, a car parked right next to me as I was walking home. I glanced over my shoulder and kept walking. When I got to my house three doors down the person in the car immediately drove away.

I am tired of being stopped on the street, followed by strange men, and knowing that being seen as another man's property is the most reliable way to have my ""no"" respected. It makes me feel objectified and unsafe. I don't want to second-guess my hair, my outfits, and my ability to be in public on my own. I want to make this stop, and I'm tired of it being my responsibility to say no.",TwoXChromosomes,172,1628543720.0,25,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/p1ap43/there_are_few_things_more_deliberate_and/
Got catcalled and almost sexually assaulted today and for some reason I feel fucking horrible about it.,"I wasn't sure who else to share this with, I just needed to get it off my chest. I just feel so fucking violated and for some reason embarrassed and ashamed at the same time.

I have a summer internship that I work at two or three days a week, and today I finished my work early and was able to leave early, which was awesome. I love my internship but really need a paying job so I've been applying all over my city, and since I was off work early I thought I'd follow up at a place at an outdoor market that told me they might have an opening.

The market is really cool and actually fairly famous, but the neighborhood it's in has its ups and downs. It's a bit ghetto and sketchy in places, but also contains a ton of historic buildings, some trendy independently owned shops and restaurants, and a gorgeous park that is probably my favorite place in the whole city. It still has a reputation (especially amongst the middle-class white people in my area) for being hood as fuck and completely unsafe, but from my experience 99% of the people there are friendly, cool, and helpful.

Anyway, I stopped at the market, still in my work clothes (a simple business-casual dress and flats) only to find that the hiring manager had left early and I'd have to stop back tomorrow. But it was a gorgeous day, and not too late in the afternoon, so I decided to walk down to the park I mentioned earlier and enjoy the sunshine for a while, then maybe stop at some of the shops in the trendier part of the neighborhood to see if any of them were hiring. 

On my way down to the park, I realized that the street from the market to the park was actually pretty long, and pretty sketchy. Nothing I couldn't handle, but a couple of jackasses started catcalling me as I walked by (one guy said ""hey baby, lemme get a slice of that pie!"" y'know, shit like that). Ugh. I felt a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed, but I decided to ignore them and go enjoy the park, which I did (had a long conversation with a sweet old black lady about Frieda Kahlo, which was unexpected but cool--like I said, 99% of the people in this neighborhood are friendly and awesome) and then wandered down to the shops for a bit. 

As I started the walk back to my car (which was still parked at the market) I realized that I had absolutely no fucking idea where I was. I turned down what I thought was the right street, looked around, realized I still didn't know where I was, lather, rinse, repeat, until I was totally and thoroughly lost, on one of the sketchier side streets of the area. At this point I was a little worried, but I've gotten lost in worse places, so I just pulled out my phone with GPS for directions back to the market. As I walked in the direction it told me to go, I passed another guy, with several friends, who shouted ""mm baby, how much for that?"" 

I'd never felt more uncomfortable, but I just tried to ignore him and kept walking, even though he was still shouting shit at me, and his friends had joined in. At this point I'm near tears, my feet have blisters on them from my flats, I just want to get the fuck back to my car and go home. I get to an intersection where I need to cross the street. As I'm waiting for the light to turn, I glance behind me and this guy and one of his friends had fucking FOLLOWED me to the intersection and were right behind me, still saying sexually explicit things to me. I turned around to just tell them to stop, thinking maybe that would do something, and saw one of the guys reaching out to try and physically grab my ass.

 At that point I literally ran across the street, because fuck the don't walk sign, and walked as fast as possible back towards where my car was. I made it back to my car, happily, but not before getting catcalled by TWO MORE DIFFERENT GUYS.

I got into my car and literally just sat there and cried for probably ten minutes before I felt stable enough to drive home. I'm probably overreacting, I didn't get groped or raped or assaulted, but I feel so fucking violated and somehow also really embarrassed and ashamed, like it was my fault for wearing a dress and makeup in a sketchy area, or just being in that area in the first place. I feel like if I tell anyone then they'll tell me it's my own fault, I just feel so stupid and ashamed and gross and I don't know what to do or if I should even do anything. All I wanted to do was enjoy a cool neighborhood on a Friday afternoon. Why can't I fucking do that without becoming like some fucking sex object that only exists to be objectified? Fuck.

I'm sorry for the long story and the rant. I just needed to tell somebody. Ugh.

EDIT: Wow, coming back to see all this support really, really helped. Thank you all so much for the virtual hugs and reassurances that it's ok to be upset and that I didn't do anything wrong. I think the most annoying part is that I know with absolute certainty in the logical part of my brain that their actions weren't my fault, and yet for some reason I STILL feel angry at myself. I don't know why that is, and it's as confusing to me as it would be to anyone else. 

For people asking why I didn't put them in their place or defend myself, I should explain that I've never been catcalled by so many people in such a short period of time, and I'm not used to being catcalled at all in the first place (I'm from a pretty suburban area). When that sort of thing happens and you're not prepared for it, your head starts racing and so many thoughts and feelings hit at once, and before you can form a coherent sentence in your defense, even if it's just ""fuck you,"" the moment's over and the people are behind you. I wish I'd said something in retrospect, but I'm trying not to beat myself up about the fact that I didn't.",TwoXChromosomes,112,1400881372.0,65,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26bxwu/got_catcalled_and_almost_sexually_assaulted_today/
Spent 2 weeks in Germany and came back to the US and I despise this place even more now.,"I (28 trans woman) went to Munich for two weeks as I am majoring in German and political science. Needless to say, it was the safest I’ve ever felt. I didn’t feel stared down (beyond the infamous German stare) I felt safe using public restrooms, and I even took public transport by myself which is something I would have worlds of anxiety doing here in the states. It was also the first time I’ve travelled without my husband who is surly looking bearded cis man. It was the first time I didn’t feel like I needed him near me for safety walking through a big city. I even spent time in super rural areas of Bavaria and was always addressed respectfully and with the correct gender by means of both titles and grammar.

Beyond that the pace of life, food, culture, art, etc. were all absolutely stunning…the first thing I saw when I logged into social media state side was a news story about a trans man being attacked at a bar in my town, and someone getting shot at store down the street from my apartment.

My husband and I are making plans to do our master’s degrees in Germany, and hopefully immigrate fully, but for now I’m back in the Midwest, staring down an election and rhetoric about trans people  that makes me want to crawl under the floor boards.

I deeply resent how vile and dirty and unsafe this country makes me feel as a trans woman. I do not feel like a part of a society here.

I’m so tired of being afraid,"I was walking home from the store when I noticed a man in a truck staring at me. We made eye contact and he waved. I thought nothing of it until he slowed down and made a right turn. He turned hung another right into an alley parallel to me. I quickly turned around in an effort to lose him, speed walking into a side street. I thought I lost him and I relaxed my pace. I thought it must have just been my imagination, but then I saw that old Chevy on the next street about 10 yards ahead. He had been circling the block. I ran up the street. There was a diner. If I could get to the diner, I would be safe. I was at the parking lot behind the diner when I saw the truck again. My heart was racing. I ducked behind a car, hoping he didn’t see me. I made it to the entrance safe, but angry. I’m so tired of men making me feel unsafe. Im so tired of how men treat women. I’m so tired and so angry. All I wanted was a peaceful Sunday afternoon. Instead, I’m sitting in a diner writing this and trying to get the courage to walk home.

"This generations experience in dating is so beyond demented, it’s actually scary, and I feel very unsafe as a woman. ","I don't know if anyone else can relate or feels the same way, but bit of a short story time... Dating in this generation is actually so terrifying.

I am 24 years old, I don't have much dating experience due to being bullied in High School a couple years back, and being treated horribly by teenagers, specifically because I hadn't grown into my looks, and ended up slightly overweight (from emotional eating, due to bullying). Cause of it, I never dated, never been kissed, I don't have experience, because all I ""know"" is High School, mentally, 

Then Covid came along, and 2 years everyone's life has been erased. As a young adult, who's lacking in a lot of ""real world"" experience, this furthered it.

Now at this age, feeling pressured by society (""if you haven't dated, you're a red flag, etc, clock is ticking, or vile homophobic assumptions from men stating I ""must be gay"" commentary and feeling unloved; I started putting myself out there.

No dating apps, but instead of shy and introverted more open, and welcoming and very sweet.

This has led me to numerous of experiences....

1. First experience was with a girl, who actively pursued me, courted me, wanted me, led me on for months, trauma bond me, pick me apart for being a virgin... Only to brutally discard me, for another woman, crawled back to me, used me again, then left me again, for a second girl who they've been thriving relationship wise for 5 months now.

2. Second was a 34 year old man, staring at me at work, approaching me, non-stop talking to me, then wouldn't stop harassing me until I gave him my phone number. Then proceeds to tell me he's sexually attracted to me, and if I'm single; I say no. Haven't heard from him since, but weirdly saw him biking on my street and got really creeped out.

3. Third guy, again met at work, was nothing but friendly, this guy then offers me a ride home, which I shouldn't have agreed to, only to later bring me on a date with him I didn't ask to be on, ""before"" he would drop me home, and made me walk in the woods with him.

4. Recent guy, is much younger, he seemed ""normal"" and nice. I was only looking tk be friends. He proceeds to Snap me multiple times, saying repeatedly ""let's hookup"" and then when I asked him to elaborate, hoping he meant to casually hang out as friends, he says he didn't mean to be weird, and he still means either or, as in friendly or to have sex. Soon as I said no, I'm too old for him, and not interested. I haven't heard a word.

I feel really creeped out, and unsafe, and most of these have been cold approaches by men, who off the bat are trying to have sex with me and use me. 

The lack of respect in this generation, is really creepy, and a friend of mine who's in for criminology, said the statistics for women being abused by men, etc have all gone up after Covid.

Now I just want to stay single and very much alone how creeped out I am.

Please be safe out there ladies, it's gotten so bad that being single truly feels like a bragging right. ",TwoXChromosomes,27,1722320088.0,4,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1efm71k/this_generations_experience_in_dating_is_so/

"I cut contact with my dad and feel guilty, am I the ahole?","F24, my parents divorced when I was seven and I went off to live with my mom. My dad had cheated on mom multiple times throughout their relationship (I was unaware of this bc I was still a child) but from what I could understand my mom stayed with him because she didn't know any better and also for my sake, but they didn't love eachother. A year prior to the divorce my mom met someone and told dad she wants a divorce. He did not take it well, AT ALL. That's when hell began for me.

He manipulated me and guiltripped my mom, he would often come early from work before mom arrived home, sit me down and tell me how mom doesn't love me and him, she found another man and will leave us. I would obviously start to cry and he would say ""Cry, OP cry, daddy is also crying"". Mom tried to shield me as much as she could, but I would hear their fights at night and it was very scary. He kept threatening he will k*ll himself, or that he will hire a hitman to kill mom. I heard this on multiple occasions.

it all escalated when he sent me to play with my neighbors, me 6 years old I instantly knew something was wrong but I was too small to articulate my thoughts so I just lied down in the playground and started crying. My friend's mom approached me and I said ""I think daddy is beating mommy"". She took me and we rushed to the house, she busted the door open and we found dad and another man beating my mom. I saw everything. My mom's face crying looking at me still haunts me to this day.

Next morning, mom packed our stuff, the guy she met came to pick us up and he then avenged my mom by beating my dad. The reason I'm saying this detail is bc my dad would then come to my school or in public with his bruised face and just stare at me through the fence and I would always crack down and cry. I'm not sure if he did this to manipulate me and make me feel bad or if I'm imagining things, but still.

I lived with my mom and her guy which then turned husband until I left for college in another country. During this time, I would meet with my dad maybe once a month. I honestly think I did it bc mom didn't want to distance me from my other side of the family. I wouldn't enjoy it, I always felt guilty when I was meeting with him. Even though to me he always said that he loves me and he wants me to live with him and always complained that I'm not calling him. To be fair, I didn't call him that much and I would often not answer to his calls but I couldn't bring myself to do it, everything about him made me feel nervous and anxious and guilty and just all the bad things. And I always thought that it's because I'm a bad kid and a bad daughter and he cares about me and I just moved on. And as more time passed from a missed call, I would feel more and more anxious and it was harder and harder to bring myself to call him, he would say stuff like he loves me and I don't love him, why I don't answer blabla

So I left for college, we would talk over the phone a bit, but to me it felt as an obligation, but I felt guilty of having this thought. He would also buy me stuff like a new phone or gadgets, and I would feel even more terrible that he does all this for me and I'm a crappy kid I could call him every now and then.

On the first college break, I came home, we were supposed to meet.He came to pick me up and the plan was to go grab a coffee.While on the road he started to complain that I was not calling him and I don't miss him and he is worried and he loves me,I would keep saying I'm sorry but he kept going on and on and he was getting angrier. I told him that ""look, I come home twice a year, let's just have a nice time together"" but he kept pushing it and started to drive faster and faster. I got scared and told him to drop this and that I feel unsafe. He kept going so I said ""okay then, I don't want to have this conversation anymore if that's how it's gonna be"" and tried to get out of the car. As I was reaching for the door (we were at a stoplight) he put his hand on my knee to stop me and this is when my fight or flight response must've kicked in because I screamed in his face ""let me go"". I saw that he froze, didn't know what to do. I got out of the car and started walking in the opposite direction.He came after me, starting screaming at me and we argued in the middle of the street, he said that ""my eyes are so full of hate and he can tell now that i never loved him"". I was crying and said ""I just don't want to have this fight, it's not fair and you wouldn't listen"" after which he said ""no, i get it all now, from now on don't call me 'father' "". I was devastated. Long story short we argued some more but we were heading in opposite directions.I went home by foot crying histerically the whole time, couldn't calm myself.

He wrote me a message in the evening where he accused me more of the same stuff and essentially saying that I don't love him and never did, and while he did manipulate me it was only one time and bc he was having a tough time with the divorce, but apart from that he ""didn't say anything apart from I love you, I miss you, I care"" and that he is sad that ""I see him as a stranger"". I didn't reply to this. I expected an apology to be fair, or at least for him to tell me that he calmed down and understands my perspective.

After this, I fully cut off contact with him, blocked his number, don't respond to his messages at all.What bugs me is that it's been 5 years since our fight and he keeps trying to reach out, at least 4-5 times a year. I feel bad and guilty everytime I get a text on social media from him but I can't respond to it, I just can't. I don't hate him anymore. I genuinely want him to be healthy and happy. I want to know that he's having a good life and everything is ok with him but I just don't want to have any contact with him.

I wrote this post because I'm not sure how to feel about this. On one side I think I overreacted and that everyone deserves a second chance and that he keeps messaging and calling and that maybe he really had a hard time with the divorce and maybe it was shitty of me as a teenager to not respond to his calls as often as he wanted. I feel that I am selfish and I should just let it go.
On the other hand, I don't love him, I don't know him. Even if he didn't want to, he caused me so much pain and trauma (fun fact I didn't have any memories of my childhood from 6 to 12 years , nothing at all, blank slate. my memories only kept coming back to me in my 20s, in the form of flashbacks at the wrongest of moments and they haunted me and made me feel angry). And I try to convince myself that I wouldn't return his calls because I was traumatised and needed distance to process things,not because I'm a bad and selfish daughter.

"18F, just moved to city, I feel like it's my first time being a girl and I'm so fucking scared","Growing up, I loved dressing in pretty clothes and being called cute and stuff. I wore skirts and pastels and cute dresses until I was 11, and at a party with my parents, some old guy lifted up my skirt and started touching my butt. He put his fingers into my underwear, on the side, and I was just frozen in place. He stopped soon, and eventually my parents' friend saw him weirdly near me and like dragged me away. When I told her what happened, she said it was bad and not to let him do it again, but didn't do anything else, and I was too ashamed to tell my parents.

After that, I stopped dressing femininely and cut my hair to a pixie cut, and my self esteem dropped to literally rock bottom, and I was just anxious and depressed all time time. I didn't start growing my hair out until junior year of high school, and didn't wear a skirt until like six months ago.

These six months since I was accepted into a great college have been incredible, and my mental health and confidence have skyrocketed. Now, I take good care of my skin, hair, and wear nice clothes, and honestly I can say that I'm really freaking pretty. I feel good, I have a super sweet partner who thinks I'm the cutest person in the world, and I'm not afraid of showing feminity anymore. Moving here, I'd felt completely confident in myself and what I was bringing to the table in my field.

I've lived in rural (my parents are agriculture scientists) and suburban areas my entire life, and I just moved to a major city for school and an internship last month. I've travelled globally and have spent a lot of time in cities, so I thought I'd be pretty prepared, but it's so much harder than I thought.

My second day here, I was walking down the street and these kids threw soda on me and called me a racial slur. A few days later I was walking to my internship and some grown man starts yelling at me, also calling me a racial slur. Living in rural areas, I'd never experienced catcalling before, but now it happens almost fucking daily. I have really big breasts (that I used to hate and wore a binder everyday to cover) and am generally curvy even though I'm really small and short (5'3""), and I've never had to deal with people looking at me like this and it makes me want to fucking die. People think it's just okay to treat me, a stranger, like a sexual object, and I never understood that this is the way the world works.

The breaking point was when I was walking to work today and some grown man came up behind me, leaned over me, and fucking *smelled me*. I've felt gross and unsafe all day. Living here makes me anxious everywhere I go, I just feel so vulnerable and scared and I almost feel that people can tell how vulnerable I am on the street. Like, I'm 18 and alone, physically weak, and I just want to feel like a fucking person and not a target. I was taught to be friendly and helpful to people, and my whole life I lived in a small welcoming community, but now that feels like opening myself up to attack.

 I just finished watching the documentary on Sarah Everard," I've just watched the Sarah Everard documentary on BBC and it reduced me to tears for several reasons. 

First, there were the images and videos shown of Sarah's journey that night, before she was stopped by her murderer. I lived in the area at the time and had been there for almost 10 years. Seeing the local shops, the streets I used to walk on my way home, the local parks I used to go to on the weekends - it brought back that sense of pain and shock and fear I felt when the news first broke out. It was the first time I felt truly personally touched by a story like this. It's hard to put into words, because obviously I feel for every woman who is beaten, abused, raped, murdered, etc. but this was so much more personal, having happened right on my doorstep. 

Then, it was the thoughts of what poor Sarah went through and her family and friends. Her mother's statement in court was just heartbreaking.

And last but not least it was the attitude of the higher ups in the Met, trying to dismiss this as bring ""over bad apple"" and saying that woken have to be ""streetwise"" and know when they can or cannot be arrested, or give bullshit advice to women who feel unsafe if approached by a police office (""flag down a bus"", ""shout at a passerby"") 

I won't even go into the WhatsApp group messages, because those just made me sick to my stomach. 

Now my question is, fellow UK women (and particularly those in London, I guess), do you feel that anything has changed? Have you seen the documentary and what did you think of it? Do you feel safe in your city nowadays? ",TwoXChromosomes,57,1710429661.0,3,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1benoxp/i_just_finished_watching_the_documentary_on_sarah/
"I don't quite understand what happened, but I feel very unsafe doing Uber deliveries now.","For context, this happened maybe six months ago, but apparently it was bothering me more than I thought, so I guess I'll talk about it.

My customer's order had to be delivered to a shadier section of the city I don't usually ever pass through. It's not the greatest area and you definitely don't want to be there at night. When I got to the street, it was kind of eerie because there were no kids out playing despite it being a weekend afternoon. The only people outside were four guys talking on the porch of a house a few doors down from the one I was delivering to.

As soon as I stopped and got out of the car, all four guys immediately stopped talking and just stared at me. It was so fucking creepy. They were carrying on a normal conversation up until I arrived. 

So I basically never took my eyes off them the entire time. Watched them while I took the bag out of the passenger's seat, kept staring back at them while I set the bag down, and made sure I was slightly facing them for the split second I had to look down to take the photo and confirm the delivery. Then I walked back to my car and drove off as fast as I could. 

All four men just kept staring at me throughout the entire process. You'd think they'd go back to their conversation, but nope, just stood there and watched me. I'm pretty sure the road through the neighborhood was one-way, but I went back the way I'd come anyway because I wasn't sure if they were planning to jump me or something if I drove past their house. 

Haven't really ubered much since, and I'm now trying to find online opportunities for supplemental income so I don't have to drive out anymore. It was just weird and creepy and I'm afraid of my next order being in that area again (I can't see where I'm delivering to until I pick up the food).",TwoXChromosomes,1,1719550479.0,2,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1dqbkg2/i_dont_quite_understand_what_happened_but_i_feel/
"Apparently, I'm not entitled to a safe space to eat","My previous job was working in the admin team of a university department. We shared one floor with another department and basically didn't have enough space. We shared a small kitchen with the other department, and we had a few small meeting rooms, but we weren't permitted to book these out for lunchtime, since the academics often needed to meet with students at this time. So, in essence, we had nowhere to eat our lunch apart from our desks. For the academic team, this was ok, since their side of the office was partitioned off and they generally wouldn't be interrupted. The admin team's desks, though, were right in front of the reception area and we would often have to deal with students dropping in, as well as visitors to the other department on our floor. In addition to this, the reception always had to be manned, so members of the admin team had to stagger their lunches at different times. 

All in all, this basically meant that you had to take your lunch outside, alone. The university campus is quite nice but has recently had a massive problem with homeless people. I feel terrible saying that because I know those people are also looking for a safe place to stay and it's not their fault, so I don't think they should have to leave, but there was a small minority of individuals who would harass students and employers on campus, and beg aggressively. The campus also overlapped with a popular drinking spot and there was a lot of drinking and drug taking all through the day. Because of these issues, there were many times when I felt unsafe eating outside by myself. I witnessed/was involved in many incidents which made me feel this way, including: a man going from person to person sitting outside asking them for money; a man who appeared to be high shouting at and harassing a female employee as she walked down the street; being called a cunt when walking past a man outside my office building; two men smoking spice coming over to talk to me while I was eating, etc.

Another aspect of this is that I have type 1 diabetes, so meal times are sort of sacred to me. Plus, I need to inject a certain amount of time before I eat. If I don't know where I'm going to be eating my lunch and how long it will take me to eat, it makes it difficult - do I inject in the office and risk going low before I find a suitable spot to eat? Do I inject outside and open myself up to abuse? Do I wait until after I've eaten, to the detriment of my blood glucose control? I normally ended up injecting in the toilets on my way to or from my desk, which is not particularly hygienic! 

Members of the (predominantly female) admin team raised this issue several times during staff surveys/whole department meetings, but our safety was always deemed secondary to another issue. We couldn't take our lunches with another colleague because somebody always needed to be at the front desk. We couldn't use the meeting rooms for our lunches because the academics needed those rooms more. We couldn't add more seating to the office because it was too expensive. 

It made me feel like being a female and being in a lower paid position, where I couldn't afford to eat out every lunchtime, meant that I wasn't as important. 

I don't work in that department any more but, thanks to Covid, I haven't yet physically been to my new department, so I've yet to see how it works there.",TwoXChromosomes,114,1598185469.0,24,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/if2a3d/apparently_im_not_entitled_to_a_safe_space_to_eat/
Afraid of Open Bedroom Windows,"I have an ongoing issue with my long-time boyfriend and the curtains/windows being open in our second-story bedroom. He likes to open the windows and the curtains in our bedroom for the breeze and to watch what's going on outside.  I want this room to be a private respite where I can change clothes or be nude. I can see all the way down the street. I have one corner of the room where I can't be seen from open windows where I do my changing when he has the windows/curtains open. 

He doesn't understand how deeply modesty is engrained in little girls- that we're to not to expose ourselves to not attract unwanted attention. We have a hot tub and a privacy fence, and you can tell he has no concerns about privacy. He's been nude out there plenty of times. 

I'm by no means a prude, but I want to have privacy in our bedroom. My mom taught me that if I can see them, they can see me. 

Over twenty years ago, my mom visited me in the duplex I lived in alone. She did some housekeeping and decorating at the house while I was not there. She enjoys it, I swear. She left the windows wide open, and my house was robbed. I filed a report, the police came and life went on. They got my Ibanez electric guitar and my comic book collection, the bastards. In the days leading to my house being robbed, I noticed a lawn chair in my yard that wasn't mine. I didn't think anything of it at the time. It dawned on me that the chair was positioned so they could see in my living room window. I slept in my living room at that time. It really creeped me out. 

I try to explain to my boyfriend that the open windows in our bedroom aren't just some pet peeve of mine, they make me feel unsafe. I don't think he will ever fully understand.",TwoXChromosomes,46,1666616467.0,17,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ycankx/afraid_of_open_bedroom_windows/
Had a creepy-guy encounter,"So I know reddit/2X has this whole issue about what kind of guys are creeps, and some think a creep is just a guy that a girl isn't attracted to, but anyway, I think we can all agree this guy was creepy.

A couple of days ago I got off work and was waiting at the bus stop.  It was about 10:40pm so it was dark and honestly, this isn't the best part of town, though I've never felt explicitly unsafe here.  I live in Canada and I think there are very few cities here where people really feel unsafe at night.

So I'm at the bus stop waiting and there is a guy waiting there as well.  The bus is due to come in about 5 minutes, so I'm just chillin.  After a couple of minutes, the guy asks me if he can use my phone to call a friend.  I tell him I don't have money on my phone (not entirely untrue) so he can't use it.  Honestly, I am not going to let a guy use my phone at a bus stop at night, even if I did have money on it.  I don't make that much money, and my phone-time is sort of precious to me because I don't use it that much and I try to make it last as long as possible.

Then he asks me if I have any change for the bus... I'm like uhhhh no.  I didn't even check. Because again, honestly, it's late at night at a bus stop.  I am not going to help a stranger get some change for the bus, it's cold and I want to get home and again, I don't make much money, my cash is precious to me.

Then he starts with small chat.  Do you work over there (cafe), do you live around here, where do you live, who do you live with.  I'm giving him the vaguest answers possible (no, no, near downtown, my boyfriend) hoping to halt chatting because I really don't want to talk to him, a stranger, at a bus stop, at night.  Considering asking him to stop talk to me because I don't feel like chatting.

Then he asks me about the sexy/adult store down the street. He asks if they are still open.  (In fact, I work there and I just got off work, so I closed the shop, so I know for a fact that we are closed).  I tell him I think they're closed.  Then he asks me if I ever go there.  WTF?  I'm like ""....."" not really saying anything, because honestly, WHY would you ask a stranger about their sex store shopping habits?  CREEPY.  Then he informs me that he, in fact, shops there often and they have nice stuff.  Great.... not good news for me since it means I might see him at the shop sometime.  I also don't say anything to this one, kind of just stare at him, not believing he'd talk to me about his sex store shopping habits.

Then he tells me that my boyfriend is lucky.  Stupidly, I ask why, with a completely disinterested voice, and he says because I'm very pretty. I tell him thanks, but in a really harsh tone.  By this time, it's 10 minutes after the bus was supposed to come (it's late) and I want to call a cab, but I told him I didn't have any money on my phone so I don't really want to whip it out and have him find that I'm guilty.  Then he decides he REALLY needs change and leaves for a bit.  I'm relieved... after a little while longer, he comes back, and the bus is finally showing up.  He says to me, ""I guess you'll be going home now... to your boyfriend..... and me... to my girlfriend...."" with a long hang.  I'm like ""Um.... yeah....""



HOW can anybody think this sort of chat is appropriate with a total stranger, at night, at a bus stop?  I mean honestly, why could he not see that he was making me uncomfortable?  Did he not care, or was he oblivious to this?  I was barely saying a word, but he kept on talking and asking me questions, to which I was answering with the barest recognition possible.  I am wondering now if I should have been more blunt and just told him to fuck off.  Thing is, I didn't want to escalate the situation, in case he was REALLY a crazy guy and got some weird ideas or wanted to hurt me if I were unfriendly.

Anyway, just wanted to rant about this and see what you guys think about the whole thing.  I actually don't really want this to escalate into a ""The word creep is sexist!"" or ""Creeps are just guys women don't like!"" thing, since I think this one is pretty clear-cut, he was totally inappropriate and I felt very creeped out.  That makes him creepy.  But I guess others might have different ideas, so I probably shouldn't rule out the possibility that someone will try to argue he's not a creep or I shouldn't call him that.... I don't really know.",TwoXChromosomes,19,1310936290.0,73,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/is8nh/had_a_creepyguy_encounter/
trust your intuition! It saved me today,"Just wanted to share my story today about creepy weirdos and to alway trust your gut! I live on a busy street and was parallel parking in front of my apartment when a guy on a bike rode past and pulled in front of me and stopped right next to my car. I got a weird vibe from him and he hung around right outside my car trying to get my attention before rolling his bike a few feet away so I tried to slip out unnoticed and had the strong feeling not to go into my house so he wouldn’t know where I live. Went across the street to rite aid, came back a few minutes later to see him messing with something over the fence, turned around, peeked back again to see him touching my car so I called the cops. They came, and showed me the guy had left a big sticker love note with a rose he had taken from our yard that essentially said “don’t be scared when you see a weird guy you might miss out on an opportunity” with his full name on it. Looked the guy up and he’s been arrested for burglary/prowling in the area and breaking through someone’s wall to try to escape arrest. 

SO, if you feel like you’re maybe in an unsafe situation, trust your intuition!!! It may save you. I am so relieved he didn’t see me go into my apartment. Stay safe out there ladies.

"A stalker followed me this morning, and I stood up for myself.","CW: harassment and assault

This is going to be a little long. Now, for context, I live in NYC. For anyone familiar with/from the area, my route when this happened was Union Square to 33rd Street on the local 6 train.

So I get on at Union Square, on the 6 train and at this point in the day (it's 11:30am, just about an hour ago), it's almost completely empty on the train. I sit down right next to the door, you know, where the metal handle curves horizontally and vertically? And I pull out a book to start reading. This guy comes on almost immediately after me. Okay, cool, it's public transportation, that's fine. And as soon as I'm settled into my seat, he steps forward in front of me. He puts one hand on the pole going vertically upward (to my left) and one hand on the pole right above my head (horizontally), so I'm basically boxed in. And there's less than a foot of space between us. Now remember, not only this is already strange and uncomfortable. The entire fucking subway car is basically empty. Like, we're talking five or six people total in the car. So there's no reason for this.

But I'm like, it's okay. he might just have spatial recognition issue; he might not realize what he's doing. If you've ever been on the subways here, you know people can really encroach in your space and be annoying--and they don't always realize it. But this guy, he's a tall guy, like, really fucking tall--maybe 6'2"" or 6'3"" (and I'm just barely 5'4"") and he's in all black. Black pants, black sweater, black gloves, black stretchy hat. White guy maybe in his early 30s.

Now for context, I have PTSD from a past assault. I don't take this shit lightly. But I'm still willing to give him the benefit of the doubt at this point. Maybe I'm overreacting, maybe he's just really not aware of his surroundings, whatever. So I decide to check.

So I glance up from my book to see where his eyes are. He's literally **staring me down**. He's not moving, I'm boxed in by metal and this man. And he's staring right into my eyes, not moving. And that's when I get angry. And based on his composure, he's definitely not drunk or high--which shouldn't even be a qualifier, but it means I know for certain he is doing this intentionally. And I don't fuck around with this stuff anymore. If you're going to try to scare me or hurt me, I'm going to fight back, and you're going to get hurt if I need to defend myself. So as soon as we near 33rd, my stop, I pull my backpack up onto my lap to create a physical barrier, place the book in it, and pull out my phone. I considered for a moment pulling out the knife that I carry with me for these instances, but I thought better of it and chose not to. I stand up as fast as I can, back straight, throw the backpack on my back, and step forward even closer to him. So I'm closing the space between us, and there's only a few inches between our chests. I push through his arm and stand in front of the subway door, and he moves so he's literally directly behind me. I can see his facial features in the reflection of the window. And now I'm angrier and I'm ready to fight. I'm not doing this bullshit again. So I unlock my phone, hold it up to eye level so he can see, and I open up the call application and start going through all of my contacts. The message is clear--keep this shit up and I will alert someone. The train comes to the station, I get off, one hand still ready to dial because he gets off at the same stop and starts walking the same direction as me, a couple feet behind me now. The other hand is balled into a fist that's ready to go into his face if need be. And I head straight toward the cops next to the MTA booth. Once near there, I turn around and see he's stopped following me; he turned and immediately walked the other direction.

This bullshit happened to me at 11am on public transportation in a relatively safe city and I was completely sober. I could have easily been attacked. I don't know why the fuck he chose to do that, but it sure as hell doesn't matter. He did it to me, and he's probably done it to other women and girls, and they might not all be able to stand up to him the same way I did--they might not be able to find police or an MTA person. They might get hurt.

I don't know who this guy is or why he decided to do that. Maybe he thought he could scare me, maybe he wanted to steal something, maybe he thought I was attractive. But it was all about control.

It pisses me off when guys get angry and are like, ""omg, not all guys are like that. you're being so unfair, you're being sexist yourself."" It's like no, shut the fuck up, this is something that happens literally every day. Fuck you for being so self-absorbed. You're worried about your ego being bruised. Women are worried about being raped or killed. I think that takes precedence.

I have been sexually assaulted and harassed by men at work, in my friend group, and on public transportation. I have been raped by a former partner. I have been called a slut by a stranger in the middle of winter when literally every inch of my body was covered, and I looked like a puffy marshmallow. So yes, we are allowed to think of every guy as a threat until they prove otherwise. And I'm going to continue to stand up to assholes who try to scare me.

Ladies, if you feel threatened, if you feel unsafe, do what you need to to feel safe and secure again. You don't have to give men the benefit of the doubt. You don't have to worry about overreacting. Your safety is more important than any guy's feelings, than any social norm, than being ""polite"".

EDIT: This event has literally left me panicking and confused. I cannot focus on anything at this point because 1) I'm upset this happened, 2) I'm afraid it will happen again because it has before, 3) I'm worried people in my life who know what I've been through will think I'm overreacting/being hypervigilant about the situation, and 4) I was heading from my psychiatrist to work when this happened, and the psychiatrist spoke about how we can't constantly be afraid of things that might happen, because bad things usually don't happen--and it did happen. This is what happens when a guy decides to do this, regardless of his reasoning. This isn't funny. This isn't a joke. I was angry in the moment and able to defend myself as I saw fit. But now? Now, I'm scared.",TwoXChromosomes,80,1579282357.0,31,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/eq3ij2/a_stalker_followed_me_this_morning_and_i_stood_up/

I am 18 and go to my first fraternity party with girlfriends…we don’t ever say it out loud but it’s understood that we need to stick together at these parties and not get separated, for our own safety.

I’m 20 and I’m working as a hostess at the Red Lion Inn in San Jose, near the airport.  Men in suits come in to eat after their meetings during the day and I see them takeoff their wedding rings before heading into the bar next to the restaurant. Every girl who works there learns quickly not to bend too far over because of the short skirts of our uniforms.

I’m 22 and it’s my first day on a new job. My male supervisor gets me into a room alone and I think he’s going to tell me about the job but instead he tells me about how much he likes sex and how he needs to have it every day. I get up and walk out of the room and avoid him after that, but I don’t tell anyone because I’m one of the only women there and I don’t know what to do.

I am 24 and I’m watching Anita Hill on TV, testifying about a man who wants to be on the Supreme Court.  I don’t understand everything I’m watching but I understand that she’s a black woman facing down a panel of white men and she is going to lose because, at 24, I do understand who has power and who does not.

I’m any age in my 20s and I’m walking on the street, in a park, in a city, in a suburb, anywhere. Men tell me to smile, to wait a minute, to slow down what’s my hurry, can I ask you a question, can I stand too close to you, can I demand your space, your time, your attention, hey where you going bitch?

I’m 25. I’m buying my first car and the salesman offers a price I know is way too high. I bring my stepdad to the showroom and the same car is now $3000 less. I smile and buy the car but inside I’m seething.

I am any age in my 30s and I think about where I park, where I go, whether I should get in that elevator that only has one man in it and how I should be sure not to make eye contact with men in the streets. All of this is normal to me and I don’t question any of it.

I’m 35. I’m buying my second car and the salesman said we should wait for my husband to get there before talking about the price but would I like to see the makeup mirror? I tell him I’m a lesbian and if he’s waiting for my husband, he’s gonna be waiting a long time…I leave, because I’m learning.

I’m 40 and a woman, Hillary Clinton, is taking a serious run at the Democratic Presidential Nomination . She’s smart, tough and qualified but she endures endless anger, viciousness and misogyny and she eventually loses in the primary.  Male friends tell me it’s probably for the best because there’s just something they don’t like about her, you know?

I’m 49 and a man who said he grabs women by the pussy is elected as the 45th President of the United States. The night of the election, I feel physically ill and my 1st conscious thought is, ‘my god, the Supreme Court’. The next morning, I overhear two men laughing and congratulating each other about the election and I feel unsafe in my own country.

I am 51 and another man who stands credibly accused of sexual assault has just been confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court. I see women on television sobbing, screaming, protesting, crying out in their anguish and their fear. I am so angry. I think of every woman I know and I am so angry.

How to stay safe on my walk to work,"I am 16(F) and about 3-4 times a week I have to walk down from my school to.My work 

My town has always been rough and the street it’s on has a lot of unsafe people that hang on it. People on drugs, suspicious people ect.

It’s always been a rough area in town but it’s gotten so much worse this year. Now every time I walk down there I see lots of suspicious people. And just this Friday there were two men high out of their minds pacing and yelling outside my work for an hour, two more passed out on the building steps, and one talking to themselves aggressively in the parking lot. My father had to get out and walk me back to the car himself which he’s never had to do 

I’ve asked my mom if I could get something like the pocketknife she has but she says I’m too young and don’t need it.But I definitely don’t feel safe going without something like that anymore. I’d find another way to get there but I can’t drive, the bus is just as sketch sometimes and expensive and it’s a 15 minute walk.

Sexually Harassed before 7am,"I've lived downtown in a small big city for over ten years. Being sexually harassed or cat called is nothing new to me. But today felt different. Today I felt like writing about it even though the interaction itself was less than five minutes. It's Monday and I'm already exhausted with men.

I've never taken the same route to work, but this morning was on of my more usual pathings. It's chilly  out, I've got my coat on, my mask on and my glasses. I know it doesn't matter but the shape of my body is vague and if it wasn't for my hair, I doubt anyone would tell the difference if I was a man or woman. I'm 5'2 and this guy was probably three times my weight and a foot taller than me.

I'm walking past the library downtown parallel to it on the other side of the street. 30 feet from me there's a man looking down at his phone, he's dressed in grey joggers and a nice looking hoodie. His other hand a convenience store bag. No one else is near by as far as I can see. I walk by him and he looks up and says loudly good morning. I walk by and say good morning back normal tone I guess?

I'm coming up to the cross walk, I don't have the sign to cross. So I wait. I hear him yell towards me ""Ma'am, I'm from downtown Chicago can you help me find this street?""

And for a split second I thought either help him or be harassed for not helping. That's how it's always been. If you're not nice you're a bitch or too good for people. That's not who I am. I always help people.

So I said sure, what street and I turn around and on his phone is a standard picture of his dick. You know the ones, unsolicited where they are standing there in a bathroom with an aerial view. I immediately turn around and walk across the street even with the sign not ready.

He's yelling to me all the things he'd like to do to me. Some pretty vulgar and I'd rather not repeat.

It wasn't even 7am, on a Monday. Why are men like this? I mean I know why. But what makes a guy go ""yea I'd love to show this random girl my average size penis at 7am"". What was he hoping to gain from this interaction

I finally got up the courage to talk with one of my cat-callers.,"Hey r/TwoXChromosomes,

I just had a really interesting conversation with a cat-caller and wanted to share. I credit this subreddit with the impetus for the conversation, as I felt safe enough because of this subreddit to try and engage with someone on a topic that is a little controversial. 

Here’s how things went down:

**SCENE**

*(A quiet, ill-lit street in Boston, Massachusetts outside of a school building. 10pm on a Friday. WEAREUNDERLINGS is wearing a motorcycle jacket and short shorts, walking home from a dinner with friends. CAT-CALLER is wearing a polo and baggy jean shorts. He stands on a step that makes him taller than most passersby.)*


**CAT-CALLER:** Hello!

*(WEAREUNDERLINGS starts, then continues walking.)*

**CAT-CALLER:** Hey, pretty girl! Look up and smile!

*(WEAREUNDERLINGS takes a few steps, stops, and turns around to face CAT-CALLER)*

**WEAREUNDERLINGS:** I’m really interested in why you chose to talk to me.

**CAT-CALLER:** You looked really down, and I wanted to cheer you up, ‘cause there’s no reason someone like you should be looking so down on a Friday night.

**WEAREUNDERLINGS:** I’m glad to know that was your intention. That seems like a really great one to have, but instead of making me feel happier, you actually made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe.

**CAT-CALLER:** I’m just talking to you. I mean, I work here (points at building) and I was coming out and thought you looked sad.

**WEAREUNDERLINGS:** I know, but it still made me feel unsafe to be walking home alone at night.

**CAT-CALLER:** Look, I just wanted to cheer you up. / Have a good night.

**WEAREUNDERLINGS:** / Unfortunately, you made me feel worse.

**CAT-CALLER:** I promise I won’t talk to you again. I won’t talk to you, I / won’t talk to you—

**WEAREUNDERLINGS:** I want you to know that, as a general rule, women walking alone at night would agree that a stranger talking to them would make feel more uncomfortable than happy.

**CAT-CALLER:** I won’t talk to you, I swear. I just said hello. Have a good night.

**WEAREUNDERLINGS:** You too. I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable, but I wanted you to know how you made me feel.

*(CAT-CALLER walks off.)*

**WEAREUNDERLINGS:** Have a good night!

*(WEAREUNDERLINGS continues her walk home.)*

The terrible thing about this, 2XC, is that for some reason, I feel bad for having had this conversation. So much hatred of the so called “feminazi” (a term that I loathe, for the record) has been instilled in me. I’m illogically afraid that I’ve become one for doing this, when it’s really just me asserting a right to feel safe in public. I also feel bad to have made him feel so uncomfortable, when I know that he made me feel the same way.

At the same time, I feel this high. I did something that I want to think is maybe bold and brave, and I hope that I got a point across to someone else.

So I know we’ve talked about this before, but I’m interested in hearing from those of you who have talked to someone who’s cat-called them. What did you feel afterwards? How did you process the experience?

**EDIT:** So I guess I was wrong to call this cat-calling, as the definition refers to sexual remarks (while this remark was not sexual in its words, I did not note that he looked me up and down as he said this, continued after I appeared viscerally uncomfortable, and I never once said to him that it was cat-calling. I felt obligated to give him the benefit of the doubt in my rendition here, rather than try to paint him from my perspective). I'll leave the cat-calling term here for the time being, as it's cool to be proven wrong every once in a while, and I'm digging the debate and criticism in the comments.",TwoXChromosomes,17,1409369963.0,59,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2ez91x/i_finally_got_up_the_courage_to_talk_with_one_of/
For the Old School TwoX crowd.,"I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vxv9c/feminism_its_for_everyone/) yesterday, and I had some thoughts about it, but I figured I was just spitting into the wind--that is, my split-second reaction was that TwoX isn't a place for thinking or discussion.

But then I remembered seeing [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vwcyv/what_happened_to_my_twox/) the day before, so... this is for the people still here who DO want thinking and discussion. This is for the old school TwoXers who think it's important to have a 21st century view of gender, but... didn't subscribe to r/feminism, and with cause.

The first post tells a story that could end no other way. If you know anything about how the phrasing of the question can affect poll results, or [choice architecture](http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0300122233), that's the stuff I'm talking about.

&gt;The following day, I attended a workshop about preventing violence, facilitated by Katz. There, he posed a question to all the women in the room: ""Women, what things do you do to prevent yourself from getting into bar fights or randomly killed?""

&gt;Not one woman, including myself, could quickly answer the question. Finally, one woman raised her hand and said, ""Nothing."" Then Katz asked the men, ""What things do you do to prevent yourself from getting into bar fights or randomly killed?"" Nearly all the men in the room raised their hand. One by one, each man testified:

&gt;""I don't look up when other men hit on my girlfriend at bars and let her handle it.""

&gt;""I watch people's shadows on the sidewalk when they walk up behind me to see if they're closing distance quickly or taking a swing at me.""

&gt;""I try not to walk home alone, or if I do, I make sure to take a safe, well-lit route.""

&gt;""I stay off my cell phone and keep my hands free outside at night.""

&gt;""I take a different route or a cab if I'm not wearing shoes I can run well in.""

&gt;""I carry a decoy wallet filled with cash and some expired credit cards.""

&gt;""I don't make eye contact and apologize profusely if I bump into someone.""

&gt;""I cross the street when I see a group of guys walking in my direction.""

&gt;""I use my keys as a potential weapon.""

&gt;The men went on for several minutes, until their side of... blah, blah, blah...

You get the point. Men and women do a lot of the same things to be *safe*, but there are some differences, because the endgames of ""unsafe"" are different flavors of shitty. Now, protecting yourself from rape will typically also protect you from getting randomly killed, but that's not *why* you did those things.

Every society shits on men and women in different ways. Generally speaking, women are inherently valued (women and children first, Natalee Holloway news cycle, etc.) and therefore exploitable (rape, etc.), whereas men are not inherently valued (homeless population, 96ish% of workplace fatalities, etc.) and therefore disposable (murder, etc.). Camille Paglia gets this part half right when she says: “A woman simply is, but a man must become. Masculinity is risky and elusive."" (She gets the part about it being confirmed only by other men completely wrong. Yang has no meaning without Yin. A Manchild can be ""one of the guys"", sure, but you're not a Real Man, a Winner, until you get the girl.)

As such, if you ask a man about being exploited, he fundamentally won't understand the question. His whole job in life is to become, to prove his value, so that it can be used when he gets the girl and becomes a valuable part of his family. Failing in this is a very real possibility. There are twice as many female human ancestors as male, so if you're a guy, getting simply written out of the gene pool is a very real possibility. Most men are so focused on achieving value and then having it be ~~used~~ utilized (more accurate, less negative sounding), that the possibility of *misuse*, of exploitation, never crosses their minds. When men *do* work so hard to achieve value and then either fail (again, in the eyes of women, not men) or have it taken from them, you get a few things: a suicide (men kill themselves more in every country except China), a particularly angry and vocal MRA, an outright misogynist, or some combination of all of the above. 

I do all of those things listed at the top to avoid getting into fights or becoming collateral damage to a robbery. I even once used my decoy wallet, and was *really* glad I had it.

More than a few times when I'm dating a girl, I've had to explain to her that she has to get better at deflecting guys' advances herself, because if I get involved, sure, 9 times out of 10, the guy's nice and he just didn't know the situation, but the 10th time, he's had too much to drink and now I'm in a fight. I'll do it if it's absolutely necessary, but I'd rather not. The fact that the possibility of violence without provocation is a part of my day to day world usually surprises them greatly. This isn't theory. One time I returned from the bathroom to find a friend of mine rolling around on the floor of the bar grappling with some guy. He'd been hitting on my date and my buddy spoke up in my absence because she looked like a deer in the headlights.

If you ask men, ""What things do you do to protect women from being raped or sexually assaulted?"" The answers would come more easily:

""I walk her home, even though it's out of my way and means I'll be doing the walk back alone in an area I'd rather not.""
""I give her cab fare.""
""If I see a woman being followed by a man, my buddy and I follow *him*.""

Again, I've personally done all of these.

Feminism *isn't* for everyone. It isn't a gender-neutral word any more than ""chairman"" or ""spokesman"" is a gender-neutral word. It's not for men or boys, and it's not for women who love men or boys. Feminism doesn't want to talk about the tricky relationship between exploitation and disposability. Feminism doesn't care that boys are *eighty-six* percent of adolescent suicides. (Source: [The CDC](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Sorting-out-puzzle-of-male-suicide-2505891.php), not a foundation with an axe to grind, like ""The American Association of University Women"") Feminism doesn't care that men are *seven* percent of elementary school teachers. Feminism doesn't care that little girls learn to fear math from their female elementary teachers. Feminism sort of cares that women hold two-thirds of all Bachelor's degrees, or that men lost most of the jobs in the recession, but only insofar as it means that desirable mates for women are hard to come by.

Feminism doesn't care that my *immediate* response, when asked what I do to protect myself from being raped was actually, ""Don't get arrested,"" because feminism doesn't care that more men than women are raped every year in the United States.

Feminists will tell you that ""If you believe in equality for the sexes, then you're a feminist!"" because [if they can get you to identify with their group, then you're more likely to go with things that you maybe wouldn't under other circumstances.](http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm?volumeID=21&amp;editionID=155&amp;ArticleID=1291) I'm not saying this is a conspiracy that involves feminists trying to brainwash people, but I *am* saying this is how the human brain works, and everybody sort of subconsciously knows it.

If it were actually true that feminism was about equality, feminists wouldn't need to go around trying to convince other women that this is the case. It would just be patently obvious from the things feminists did in the name of feminism. Rather, what is obvious is that feminism is about female advocacy, which can be a good thing in some contexts, but is hardly a way to run a world.

Men and women evolved together. We're a matched set. Any sophisticated and helpful gender theory, a gender theory that actually aims at equality for the sexes, must account for men and women living together, dealing with the centuries of accumulated cultural bullshit that apply to both genders, and raising children of both genders.

This post isn't actually about men, and if it sounds that way, I apologize. I am, however, saying that, keeping your boyfriend or husband safe is a women's issue, that making sure your son doesn't become a suicide statistic is a women's issue, that making sure your daughter's math skills aren't stunted by skewed elementary school teacher demographics is a women's issue, and that making sure the society doesn't dispose of boys *en masse* so the next generation of young women have young men to marry is a women's issue. Feminism obscures and denies the legitimacy of these issues.

Feeling angry and humiliated tonight. Just here to vent about the perils of running as a woman.,"I went for an after-dinner run tonight, around 6:30pm, and I noticed a van following me - he would pass me, pull off to the side, wait for me to pass him, then pass me and pull off to the side again. After three or four blocks, I started to get nervous, so I looked to see who was driving the van, and the man in the driver’s seat was masturbating and staring right at me. 

I’ve been followed and cat-called while running before, but I’ve never felt so violated and so unsafe in my life. I was on a busy street and it was still light outside, and this still happened. And I guess what I don’t understand is why. Why would a man do this? Isn’t this demeaning for him? 

Despite my best efforts to get away quickly, it took me another three blocks to lose him, the whole time fearing he would get angry or violent with me for trying to evade him. Luckily, he only shouted at me and didn’t try to physically engage, but I’m still feeling very shaken and upset about the whole thing.",TwoXChromosomes,113,1599363982.0,15,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/inf7sp/feeling_angry_and_humiliated_tonight_just_here_to/
"Motorist tried to bully me onto a dangerous road, i didnt feel like aquiescing.","So as a young looking 27 year old female, I'm used to men trying to bully me into doing unsafe manoeuvres on the road when my children are in the car, but this one took the biscuit. Particularly since a couple of weeks ago, a man in a van forced me so far to the side of the road that I got scratches all along the side of my car and had to spend hours trying to get them off with toothpaste.

So today, another man in a van was parked in the middle of the street delivering packages. It was inconvenient but whatever, I patiently waited for him to deliver his packages and left ample room for him to pull closer into a space his side of the road so I would be able to pass and we could go on our ways.

However, not contented with blocking me and having me wait whilst he did his business, he motioned for me to back out into a main road ( cars were parked either side). Irritated with his sense of automatic entitlement, I motioned to the space I had spotted for him. 

He laughed, shook his head and again, motioned for me to back my daughter out onto the street.

This irked me. I had already had some asshole damage my car, I put my handbreak on, mouthed that I had all day and crossed my arms.

Cue disbelief and cussing me out but he moved the few meters to do the decidedly easier and safer manouvere than he had expected me to do.

How should I respond to a guy following me down the street asking for my number? Is it wrong to just ignore?,"So I work in a pretty rowdy/high crime area where a lot of people catcall (and if you're a man people will ask you if you want to buy drugs).  So I pretty much keep to myself if I have to walk anywhere and just avoid all other humans.  Not sure if it matters but I am 26.

Several times now I've been walking to my office building and I hear some guy (different guy each time) shout out ""Miss! Miss!"" while walking behind me.  If I were in another area of town I'd probably assume someone needed directions but because I don't want to make contact in a high crime area I just pretend I don't hear them.  EVERY TIME, it turns out to be sexual.  It's never about directions, or telling me I dropped something, etc.

If I pretend I don't hear, they will follow me down the street, down several blocks, at first saying cute/flirtatous things about wanting my number, thinking I'm pretty, etc (even though they're behind me and can't see my face).  If I continue to ignore, they will get angry and start telling me I'm a bitch, I'm ungrateful, etc etc.  Sometimes they accuse me of being snobby, shallow or racist...but I never even see their faces, I can only hear them following me.  I make a point NOT to make eye contact.

The funny thing is- I'm married!  So I'm not ignoring them because I think I'm hot shit.  I'd ignore *anyone* who hit on me.  The difference is that if I was hit on in a less invasive way, in a more ""normal"" place (like a bar or party) I'd respond with ""Sorry, I'm married.""

The difference is that I feel really unsafe talking to ANY stranger on the street, even to tell him I'm married.  Apparently a woman in my city talked back to a catcaller and got stabbed.

I know it's probably rude to ignore, but isn't it ruder to follow a stranger down the street yelling at them?  And why should I be so flattered that someone (often twice my age...) wants my number when they've only seen the back of me and haven't even seen my face or met me?  It's really not that much of a compliment.

But in the back of my mind there's this nagging voice telling me I really AM a rude person for ignoring, and I should politely be like ""Thank you, sir, but I'm married.""  But at the same time it doesn't feel safe to have contact with strangers like that.

There is more to this Hobby Lobby ruling...,"Here is an article that I wrote about Monday's Supreme Court Ruling. I just thought there were more pieces to this story that wasn't being addressed.

The bonfire of women’s rights continues
Liz Phillips, Photo Editor
July 1, 2014
Filed under Editorial, Opinion


Yesterday, I heard one of the worst things I’ve heard in a long time: the Supreme Court ruled that in this country, a for-profit company’s religious beliefs are more important than a woman’s rights to her body.

Obama’s Affordable Care Act came with a contraception mandate, which requires employers to include contraception in their employee health plans. Hobby Lobby was solicited by The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and convinced to sue that some types of contraception (IUDs, and the Plan B, and Ella morning-after-pills) clashed with their Christian beliefs and infringed upon their religious rights (More on the Becket Fund later).

The Supreme Court ruled in the favor of Hobby Lobby, citing the company as a “person” and thus protected under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

According to some voices, this is a “narrow” ruling, affecting only “closely held companies,” so there is no cause for alarm. The definition of a closely held company is one that at least 50% of the companies stock is held by up to 5 family members.

But how narrow is that definition? Just last year, buy backs brought the Walton family’s portion of stocks of Wal-Mart to 50.9%. Their family is also religious. It also falls under the category of a “closely held company.” And they have more employees than any other company in the United States. Koch Industries? Yea, they count too.
When you’re talking about a group of companies that includes Hobby Lobby, Wal-Mart and Koch Industries, the results can no longer be defined as “narrow.” When the subject is a woman’s right to her own body and the opponent a religion whose God’s name is in the pledge of allegiance and on every piece of U.S. currency, it is no longer “localized.” That is why we are worried. That is why it is important.

More than 70 other companies have also sued to be exempt from Obamacare’s contraception provision. 48 of those are still pending. Our justice system looks to the rulings from the Supreme Court for guidance in their own cases in the lower courts, and now they have it.

There is an existing system in place to provide those with contraceptive coverage if they are employed by, for example, the Catholic Church. Supposedly, all the newly affected women will join this channel of access to these now restricted rights. But how will a system set up for thousands of people handle the influx of applicants? How long will it hold out until a new president or congress decides that there just isn’t a budget for women’s contraceptives anymore?

According to Hobby Lobby owners Barbara and David Green’s video response to the ruling “America is a country founded on and sustained by religious liberty.” But Mrs. Green, you are misinterpreting the liberties that our founding fathers intended.

In 1779, as the Governor of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson proposed a bill (Virginia’s 1786 Act for Establishing Religious Freedom) that would assure full equality for citizens of all religions in Virginia. “… meant to comprehend, within the mantle of it’s protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo, and infidel of every denomination.” That means we all get to exist and get to be protected from each other.

How could religious liberty exist if everyone were allowed to affect each other with their own religious agendas? It couldn’t. And our founders never intended for that to happen. They were secularists. In her book Freethinkers, Susan Jacoby describes the distinction: “… a secularist’s specific metaphysical beliefs are politically irrelevant, because insistence on the distinction between private faith and the conduct of public affairs is precisely what distinguishes secularists from the religiously correct”

But despite our founders’ efforts, the Protestant, and recently Catholic, agendas have infected our secular system. The phrase “Under God” was added to our pledge of allegiance in 1942. “In God we trust” was added to our money in 1957. Judicial and executive branches of our government have even endorsed tax breaks to people who wish to send their kids to religious schools.

But when our nation was born, Jefferson not only wanted to protect religions from government, but government from religions as well. He meant for me, as an “infidel”, to have protection against your brand of Christianity or religious institution.

To those who wish to play devil’s advocate and retort that “employees shouldn’t be able to force their beliefs on their employers,” I beg you to reassess your definition of affectation. If an American Islamic extremist wished to sue and demand that his women employees wear the hijab and take away their right to choose their clothing, who would you say was the one truly being forced?

11 year-old Nashala Hearn, a 6th grader in Oklahoma won her case in 2004 when she sued her school district who suspended her for wearing her hijab. It is her right to follow a religious belief that does not negatively affect anyone else. Plenty of people believe the hijab to be a form of repression, but in this country, it can be a choice, and we need to respect it. The difference is in the hypothetical situation where someone is forced to physically follow someone else’s belief system contrary to their own beliefs. That is invasive and against this country’s democratic intentions.

In Jefferson’s 1800 presidential campaign, he wrote “The legitimate powers of government extend only to such acts as are injurious to others… it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.”

But this ruling is injurious to others. Statistics have shown time and time again that inaccessibility to legal birth control negatively affects the underprivileged, while not making a dent in the upper classes.

Late last year, the Guttemacher Institute found that “Between 1994 and 2006, the number of unintended pregnancies among women whose incomes fall below the national poverty line rose by 50 percent. At the same time, however, unintended pregnancies dropped among more economically privileged women.”

And while fighting for the lives of helpless infants is all well and good, why does the zealous goodwill stop once the baby is actually born? As a “religiously founded” nation who cares so deeply about the life of the unborn fetus, we also have a rate of child poverty that is so high, in the developing world it is only bested by Romania. According to the CIA, even Cuba has a lower infant mortality rate despite a low economy.

Take Mississippi as an example. It is the most religious state in the U.S according to a 2013 Gallup poll. It also is one of the hardest places to get any form of birth control. It is also the third highest-ranked state for unwanted pregnancies, the highest for overall poverty (24.2% live below the poverty line), and highest for child poverty. One in three. That’s three times as high as Lithuania, according UNICEF.

And no offense to Hobby Lobby, or the hard-working Americans who work in your aisles, but your employees are not picked from the privileged class. Your employees and your communities are part of those previous statistics. The one’s that could never afford to replace what you have now taken from them. They will be directly affected by this ruling.

This ruling only affirms that to many, women are still mostly a child-bearing vessel. The potential life inside her is more precious than the one she is trying to live herself. The guise of “saving a life” is rhetoric that has drawn many good-willed people to its cause, unwittingly knowing they are merely playing someone else’s power game. It is a tactic that has been used by powerful men, for thousands of years. It’s meant to keep their women at home, subservient, making more little beings for them to rule over.

In fact, let’s take a look at one of the authorities who made this decision: Anton Scalia, Supreme Court Justice since 1986. In 2002, he gave an infamous speech to the Chicago Divinity School titled “God’s Justice and Ours,” where he made it quite plain that he believes our democratic process amounts to nothing in comparison to the will of God.

“It is easy to see the hand of the Almighty behind rulers whose forebears, in the dim mists of history, were supposedly anointed by God, who at least obtained their thrones in awful and unpredictable battles, whose outcome was determined by the Lord of Hosts, that is, the Lord of Armies. It is much more difficult to see the hand of God – or any higher moral authority – behind the fools and rogues (as the losers would have it ) whom we ourselves elect to do our own will. How can their power to avenge – to vindicate the “public order” – be greater than our own?”

And yet, he participates in our democratic processes while he internally scoffs at us all. Even more horrifying, is that while he similarly believes abortion is tantamount to murder, he has no qualms with the death penalty, even for the mentally challenged or minors. In the same speech, Scalia said; “The more Christian a country is the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. I attribute that to the fact that, for the believing Christian, death is no big deal.” Why is it no big deal for the man when it is so terrible for the fetus? Where is his love for human life? It remains conveniently tucked away until that argument serves his purposes.

I would like to state that I don’t believe Mr. and Mrs. Green to be bad people. Quite the contrary, I believe they are acting within their version of utmost idealism and good will. They also pay their employees a little higher than the established minimum wage, donate half of their profits to charities, and take Sundays off, even though that choice might cost them billions.

But I also find it interesting that they did not come up with this plan on their own. Rather, they were solicited by The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty about two years ago to be the poster child for this cause. They were hand picked to be attached to a battle that other people had already decided to fight.

The Becket Fund is a 17-year-old-old non-profit law firm, dedicated to protecting religious rights across the world. They have been a widely respected, levelheaded institution, protecting Christians, Muslims, Jews, alike.
 
But in 2011, their leadership changed, and while before they were lead by founder and former Justice Department attorney Kevin Hasson, they are now at the hands of William P. Mumma, a Wall Street Banker who ran the New York trading desk for Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA.

“What the Becket Fund is trying to do right now is when we know there’s an issue that is really threatening to religious liberty, we are actively out there looking to see if there’s a client we can help,” said  Mumma, President and Chairman of the Board of The Becket Fund.

In a 2012 Huffington Post article written by Jon Ward, the Becket Fund’s executive director Kristina Arriaga comments on the new leadership “So we are a nonprofit that runs like a well-oiled business now. We have gone from Guerilla warriors to special forces.”

In the same article, Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State says the Becket Fund is “trying to raise their profile dramatically. I think there’s a kind of competition on the so called religious right about membership and contributions.”

This might explain why the Becket Fund was so eager to bring Hobby Lobby into their battle. As openly conceded by Mumma, the fight will not stop there. Their new policy is an active one. They are not defending rights anymore. They are attacking them. Seek and destroy. This is not the end for them. This was one battle, but they are fighting a war.

So to Mrs. Green, I wish to remind you that historically, we are a country that was founded by secularist white men, but later captured, controlled and sustained for white Protestant (and eventually also white Catholic) males while the rest of our little melting pot has been trying to catch up ever since. But it was really nice of your husband to let you do the talking in your video response. So, at least there’s that.

The belief that this will remain an insular incident of religious rights is naïve. The United States has been losing a battle against the separation of church and state for over 100 years, and women have been fighting for basic equality rights for much longer than that. This ruling will have far reaching effects, but the profits will be held by just a few.

Our founders wished to create a free and enlightened country. In a letter our 2nd president, John Adams, wrote to our 3rd president, Thomas Jefferson in 1813, Adams states “Miracles or Prophecies might frighten Us out of our Witts; might scare us to death; might induce Us to lie, to say that We believe that 2 and 2 make 5. But We should not believe it. We should know the contrary.”

What's one good thing that happened to you this week?,"I have no photos to show, woe. But there's a lot of bad going on out in the world, from the big (Calais, the Mediterranean crisis, Syria, poverty, famine) right the way through to the mundane (getting made to feel unsafe walking down the street). 


But we don't get to celebrate the mundane good so much as the bad. The big, maybe, but not the little. So what do you want to celebrate, to remind yourself that it happened? 


I carved out time at work to put some energy into a project I really want to work on, and my boss conceded he'd basically stolen my thunder in a big meeting and acknowledged that it was actually for me to do. And I had an awesome exchange which was thoughtful and interesting with a dude on OkC.

This morning I was hit on while walking to work.  (And it was not awesome.),"This morning I was hit on while walking to work.  This 40 something year old dude is yelling something to me across the street, so I do the ""What?"" sign, putting my hand behind my ear.  I still can't hear what he's saying; I cross the street (it was the street I was crossing anyhow), he repeats himself, but there's still traffic, so he has to repeat himself a fourth time.  ""You look familiar; do I know you?""  ""No, sorry.""  ""Well, can I get to know you?""  ""Sorry, I'm just walking to work.""  And I go on.  The street's pretty quiet, since the Dane County buildings are closed for furlough today.  And I start thinking about how I'd make my way to the Capitol if it was night, or what I would do if the guy started following me.  I wasn't nervous or uncomfortable, but that's what women think about in those situations: a plan JUST IN case.  When I stop thinking about it, about two or three blocks down, who comes up riding on a bike behind me.  ""The courthouse is closed today.""  ""Yeah, the county buildings are closed for budget reasons.""  ""I wish someone had told me; now I need to go home, write a check and send it in."" ------  ""Hey, so, would you be interested in a guy like me?""  ""I have a boyfriend.  But have a nice day.""  And he pedals off.  Like I said, I wasn't uncomfortable or unsafe, but on the one hand it's like, Come on, man, just let me walk to work in peace, and on the other hand, it's so frustrating that my manners hold me back from saying flat out ""I'm not interested; leave me alone.""
 
Then, later, when reflecting on this encounter, I got this sudden feeling of dread.  ""Oh crap, now that it's warm, do I have to start worrying about wearing a tank top out when I'm alone again?""

Has anyone lived in Logan Square (Chicago)?,"So long story short, I (30F) am finally financially able to move out of my parents house. I don't make that much money, so that combined with the income requirements landlords have, means I can't afford much. I also want to do this without a cosigner, which again limits my options. I finally found a small studio in Logan Square and am going to look at it this weekend, and I am really excited. I filled out an application after a virtual tour but asked them to pause until I could see it in person.

My family (most of whom have never lived in the city at all) does NOT like this. They think the city is unsafe and that I'll end up murdered.... They keep trying to get me to stay in the suburbs or other ""nicer"" areas of Logan Square. They're, I feel, not listening to me or respecting my opinion, which is not new. (This is also why I didn't tell them I was seriously looking, because I knew exactly this would happen.) 

But I would like to know, what do you think of Logan Square? I did research and asked some friends what they thought, and they said it's safe.",TwoXChromosomes,1,1666618088.0,11,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ycba1g/has_anyone_lived_in_logan_square_chicago/
I can't leave my hotel because I'm a woman.,"I'm travelling for work and staying in a country that isn't considered safe for women, in several cities which are all considered particularly unsafe (I'm not going to say the exact location to preserve anonymity/avoid arguments). I have loads of meetings and a couple of tours organised by local contacts which I'm escorted to, but have scheduled in plenty of downtime to catch up on other work and relax as the meetings are pretty intense.

If I'm not in meetings, I'm in my hotel room. I can go to the hotel restaurant, but in the evenings I get leered at by the men there. The hotels have excellent security and are recommended by my company so I'm not worried about anything happening but it's unpleasant to sit and be stared at for daring to be a lone woman. I haven't even considered using the pool or gym for this reason.

Leaving the hotel is out of the question. There's a very good chance I'd be assaulted or worse. I'm in places with beautiful scenery and history, incredible sites to see, and I can't see them because I'm a woman. I can't even pop to a beach or bar down the street for a change of scene. There's no point scheduling a holiday at the end of my work trip because I'd still be stuck in hotels.

I know I'm incredibly privileged to be able to travel for work, but fuck me it sucks to stare at the same four walls for half the day when I could be out exploring if I was a man.",TwoXChromosomes,56,1656182381.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vklfa4/i_cant_leave_my_hotel_because_im_a_woman/
I think I almost got mugged yesterday.,"And it's just starting to sink in. I'm more scared now than I was when it happened.

All I've got to say is listen to your instincts. 

Yesterday, middle of the afternoon, I'm out running errands. After the grocery store, I drove across the street to for a couple of bags of ice at the self-service place. 

It's a kiosk in the corner of a parking lot that sells bulk ice and water. A bring your own container place. I use it sometimes when I need lots of ice. 

It's not isolated. It's at the far edge of a shopping center parking lot, next to a busy road. I've never felt unsafe there. The parking lot is busy. The street is busy. 

When I drove up, a guy was there buying water. The kiosk has two filling stations, one on each side, and the guy was using both. I parked on the side opposite from his car and waited for him to finish. When he finished with the side closest to me, I got out and started getting ice. He was packing up and left shortly. 

As I'm standing there, waiting for the ice to fill, another car pulls up. But they don't pull up to the other, free side of the kiosk. They stopped so that my car is between them and the kiosk. So I glanced over because I couldn't figure what they were doing. 

There were two guys in the car. One guy gets out and walks around my car to the other side of the kiosk. He's wearing a winter coat and some kind of scarf over his head. 

Now,  it's crazy hot right now. Temps are over 100 every day. 

I don't think I had a coherent thought in my head. I jumped in my car, locked the doors, and started the engine. Drove off. About 2 seconds later,  I thought, ""well that was weird. I'll just circle the block and come back for the ice."" 

But as I'm circling the kiosk to get to the exit,  I see the other side is vacant. The guy just disappeared. I look over, and their car is gone. 

I pulled out of the parking lot and decided I'm going home. No more errands today. And I guess the next customer got some free ice. 

I spent last night not thinking about it. I woke up this morning scared out of my mind. 

And maybe I overreacted. But I don't think so. Thank goodness for whatever instinct made me get in the car and lock the doors.",TwoXChromosomes,9,1689188890.0,4,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14xxlzv/i_think_i_almost_got_mugged_yesterday/
Rant: being old does not make it ok to be creepy,"Warning: long rant ahead. There's an old dude who is always walking at the track I run at,  and he acts like a total creep. I'll be running alone in the sweltering heat and he'll immediatly show.  Gets offended if I don't say hi to him.  Makes an effort to be in my way so I have to acknowledge him. I ignore him,  but it only makes it worse.  

 I've had so many people tell me that's it's not that big of a deal because he's old and can't pose a physical threat,  but why am I still angry that this man can act like a complete ass and get away with it because he's old? So like,  oh you have a cane so it's ok to make a woman feel uncomfortable while she's running???

I have dealt with this for months only for the reason that I can clearly outmatch him physically  (if he wasn't carrying a gun or whatever) but yesterday I left and he followed me in his SUV up the street,  and when I noticed him,  I whipped around and faced his vehicle,  giving the meanest look I could,  and this man stops his car to stare me down and then drives away without saying anything.  

 I know I've been assaulted in the past and so that makes me a little bit more paranoid of situations like this. He could be completely innocent and ignorant of how hes making me feel. But I seriously feel like I'm in some sort of crime story where I end up dead and everybody is shocked that such a ""sweet old guy"" could be responsible. I am so mad over this.  

 I'm mad that I can't even go for a run without feeling like I'm unsafe. My feelings are valid and I'm tired of having to explain it to people. I have no idea what to do because so many people are telling me hes just a sweet guy who's lonely and I should just let it go. But that makes me even angrier 🙁 I hate that this is the reality for so many women like me:  tolerating creepy guys for their ""feelings.""",TwoXChromosomes,22,1656188619.0,11,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vknkg7/rant_being_old_does_not_make_it_ok_to_be_creepy/
A man cornered me (26F) on my walk,"I'm not sure if this story belongs on this sub or on something more like r/LetsNotMeet, but I'm a little shaken and I think writing this down will help me let it go.

Snow is one of the few things in this world that brings me pure unadulterated happiness. Unfortunately, it snows very little where I live. When it does, I like to take walks through the wildlife reserve a few streets away from my house. Most walkers follow a public road through the woods and avoid the private driveways of the few people who are rich enough to live there. I'm no exception. Every time I come to an intersection I check for mailboxes, house numbers, and no-trespassing signs. Today, I turned onto a road that had none of these. 

I live in a temperate rural area, so the roads are pretty empty when the temperature drops below freezing. I didn't expect to run into very many people, but because I was in a suburban area I assumed I would be safe walking alone. After about 30 minutes I came to an intersection between two single lane roads. I assumed that it was open to the public, but a few minutes later I saw a house up ahead, and that's when I realized I was being followed. 

I had no interest in being on someone's private property, so I turned around and started walking towards the main road and the person who was following me. He was an older man wearing winter clothes and carrying a walking stick, so I kept my head down and waited until we were about 20 feet away from each other to give him a nod. When I looked up, he was just standing there, staring at me. I stopped too.

He asked, ""What are you doing?"" I told him that I was going for a walk, but I didn't realize that I was walking towards a house. The driveways here are very long and mistaking one for a road isn't uncommon. He just kept staring, silently. He was blocking the road, so I asked if it was his house and apologized for not realizing it sooner. No response. After a few seconds, he said, ""Come here, I want to show you something."" And nodded over his shoulder. I said, ""No, I'm not comfortable with that."" But he persisted, so I continued, ""I'm a young woman walking alone. I didn't know this was a driveway. I'm going to leave now and continue on my way."" 

At this point I was very aware that I was defenseless, under 5 feet tall, and alone in the woods with a man who was carrying what could easily become a weapon, so I continued walking. When I passed him he followed me and pointed towards the intersection, asking, ""Did you see a name down there?"" I said no, and that I was sorry. He shouted, ""I *know* you're sorry!"" I balked, and walked faster. I was done with the friendly neighbor act. All I wanted to do was get out of there. 

He asked me again if I'd seen a name at the intersection, and must've realized that I was done answering him because he started berating me for walking in *my own private neighborhood*. I mean I look like a literal 10 year old, what did he think? That I was casing the joint? I fucking live here too, buddy! 

He followed me all the way back to the main road. I wanted to continue my walk, but in the end I felt too unsafe and went home. All I could think about was how easily he could've hurt me without anybody noticing. I felt so stupid for ending up in that situation alone, without any means to protect myself. 

The scariest part was his complete lack of concern after I told him he was frightening me. He had the opportunity to be a decent human being, but he turned it down in favor of threatening a woman who was lost and alone in the woods.",TwoXChromosomes,30,1640919511.0,13,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/rsjo9e/a_man_cornered_me_26f_on_my_walk/
Was I targeted for human trafficking?,"Sorry if this doesn't belong here, this is my first account and I usually just read a few subreddits. If anything is incorrect please let me know. 

I'm a young, 20-something woman studying abroad who recently may or may not have been targeted for human trafficking. I won't reveal my location other than that it's somewhere in Europe. 
Anyway, recently I was asked to go out with a 20-something man that I did not know. He walked up to me as soon as I came out of the metro and started talking to me. Overall our interaction didn't seem too strange, he invited out for some dinner, and afterward we could walk around the city at around midnight. I figured it was so late just because schedules can be weird and complicated.

My mom and I are extremely close, so I told her about it. She was supportive, but both of my parents tend to be a bit overprotective when it comes to my safety. A few weeks ago a man had stopped on the street and took pictures of me as I walked past. At the time, I just assumed that it was probably for some sort of fashion thing, told my mom about it jokingly and just brushed it off.

Today I received a call from my mother that apparently the two situations combined were classic examples of being 'scouted' for human trafficking. I'm honestly a little scared. I was hoping to do some solo travelling, but now I'm not so sure.

TwoX, do you think that this could be potentially dangerous? I was told to go to the embassy and report it, but I haven't been able to find to much information on what to do. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: I ended up not going for dinner with him, just because neither of our schedules ended up working out. I never felt unsafe around him, but I started feeling weird about it when my mom mentioned that this is a typical process of being 'scouted' for human trafficking. She suggested I go to the embassy to report it, but the more comments that I read, the more I think it wasn't anything malicious.

To All The Conservatives Celebrating Roe V. Wade,"Abortions will exist, whether you like it or not. Making them illegal will not stop them, just make them more unsafe. 

If you truly believe in Christ and follow in his path, I’d like to think you’d rather women carry out safe abortions than to punish them for it. 

It doesn’t matter if they consented to the baby, if they used birth control, if they’re even adults. You believe that child has a right to life. But please hear me out. 

I say this as someone who has been diagnosed with PTSD twice. I was emotionally neglected, and verbally, mentally and emotionally abused growing up. That alone was enough for me to develop PTSD that has been diagnosed by two separate therapists. I was well off, too. I had all my physical needs taken care of. Even being planned, I grew in an environment where I was made to feel a burden for simply existing. 

I believe children should be born into this world with a right to a *quality* life. Not perfect, not without suffering but the thought of bearing a child into this world knowing they will face extreme suffering the moment they’re born up to the moment they die doesn’t sit right with me. Imagine how much worse it will be for children who are not wanted, who are forced to be birthed by women who did not want them. 

Your job is not to write laws, nor to judge. Your own scripture says Jesus is the ultimate judge. Sin will exist whether you like it or not and outlawing it only makes it unsafe for women to get abortions. 

Women who get late term abortions WANTED that baby, they NEED it because somethings gone wrong. Women get abortions because they can’t afford a child, and don’t want to bring a child into the world they can not care or provide for. Women get abortions because they may have been raped and are too young to have a child, they will not be able to care for those children the way those children need to be cared for. 
Imagine living in a world where the very person who birthed you can not care for you, because they don’t have the resources or the will to do so because that child was an UNWANTED pregnancy. I would hope you would never want a child to experience that sort of suffering. 

I should also hope that you would much rather people who NEED abortions are able to safely get them, rather than punish them for something out of their control because you disagree with it in principle. 

I don’t agree with theft, but I’d rather someone who’s starving steal bread than go hungry.  

I don’t agree with murder, but I’d rather someone kill another to defend themselves than die. 

I don’t agree with prostitution, but I care enough about the human beings that I’d rather they have safe, protected sex and personal protection than cast them to the streets to fend for themselves amongst predators. 

Abortion isn’t fun for women. Women don’t go around having unprotected sex and think, “I’ll just get an abortion,” like it’s shopping for groceries at the store. 

It’s a difficult decision, and more importantly, it is not your place to enforce laws or judge the women who have them. Based on YOUR scripture, that is your Lord’s job and your Lord’s job alone. Your job is to love your neighbor as yourself, even if you perceive them to be a worse sinner. Do you really believe your Christ would punish women who NEED abortions (such as the case is in ectopic pregnancies)? 

Speaking of scripture, I suppose you all missed Psalm 137:9. And don’t bother telling me I’m missing context or taking it too literally, I have studied your book since I was 12 and I know more about it than you, I promise you. I know Christmas isn’t a Christian holiday, it was a pagan holiday adopted by Christian’s to get pagans to convert. Same with Easter. 
I know of the various mistranslations, the most damning one condemning homosexuality when originally, Leviticus condemned pedophilia. 

It would be bad enough that you want to enforce religious laws that directly violate our constitutional right to have freedom of religion, but many states are also banning sex education, contraceptives and birth control. 
You can not have it one way or the other. 
Even going on the argument that abortion is murder, how can anyone POSSIBLY argue that BIRTH CONTROL is equivalent to murder simple because a child can’t be as easily conceived? 

You want rights to women’s bodies and reproductive cycles? You’ve taken them, but don’t pretend you’re morally pure for doing so. Your own God would detest the work you’re doing, and I guarantee you if Christ came before you right now he would reject each and every one of you who supported the Supreme Court. 
It is not your job to cast stones, for you are not innocent. You would rather condemn women to death or jail for so much as a natural miscarriage instead of aiming to love and support thy neighbor. 
Your hands will run red with the blood of women who die from self induced abortions, from ectopic pregnancies that can not be aborted because of your uninformed Laws that aim to punish women for sex whether they consented or not. The fate of children given up to the foster system to become abused, of children who will grow in homes without love or support is on YOUR hands. May you live with your decisions, these decisions you’ve forced upon others.",TwoXChromosomes,40,1656113999.0,6,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vk1mi2/to_all_the_conservatives_celebrating_roe_v_wade/
Home Security,"Hi all,
I’m feeling a bit over my head, and am hoping to get some advice/clarity. I live in a large urban city in the US, end of a dead end street, with my dog and SO. Since moving in here we have had some strange things happen. From the city normal of someone ringing the door bell and leaving to finding a pink ceramic knife in the back yard. Maybe it was a neighbor above (there’s a retaining wall in the yard, houses on top) or maybe it wasn’t. Either way, with my SO traveling more I would like to get some cameras set up so I can feel safer. 

The thing that I’m struggling with is the safety of my data. Being AFAB and presenting as female I’m worried about someone being able to use a security feature to track me. Knowing my comings and goings, being able to know when I’m alone, makes me vulnerable. It makes me feel unsafe even while trying to increase my feelings of safety. 

Am I being too concerned about this? Do you have recommendations of set ups/programs that have made you feel safe? 

tl;dr: ISO security camera/program that can help me be safe and not be exploited by bad actors. 

Mil gracias 💜

Did I overreact?,"I like to get out and walk on the C&amp;O Canal towpath a few times a week. It’s usually full of other walkers, joggers, cyclists, so I’ve never felt unsafe out there by myself. This morning, however, it was lightly raining on and off, so I guess that scared a lot of people away, and the trail was practically deserted. Right after I set out, about 30 feet behind another woman, I noticed a man who had been lingering near a bridge just off the trail start to follow about 10 feet behind her. She seemed completely oblivious to him keeping pace on her, and I don’t think either of them were aware I was bringing up the rear. 

Now, the guy seemed way out of place out there. Usually people on the trail are dressed in athletic or outdoor clothes. This guy was wearing what I’d call street clothes: a black shirt, gray chinos and black shoes, which seemed strange for hiking a muddy trail. He was also smoking, which is unusual to see out there, because most people are on the path for some form of exercise. I don’t know anyone who smokes while exercising. I was just getting major creep vibes from this guy, between the way he was following that woman and the way he was dressed and how at odds it was with the activity typically seen along the canal. His body language was off, too; he seemed really stiff, and he kept clenching and unclenching his right fist. Altogether, it was just…weird. 

So I discreetly snapped a picture of the guy from behind and texted it to my girlfriend, giving her a quick description of him and the fact that he was giving off creeper vibes. She wanted me to turn back to my car, but I didn’t want to leave that other woman alone out there with this guy creeping up on her. (I use a cane or trek poles when I walk the canal, due to a spine injury, so felt somewhat better about having a “weapon” on me so I could fight back if it came down to it.) Luckily my girlfriend works from home, so she insisted on coming to meet me; she threw her bike in her car and headed out. I tried to keep up with the woman and the creeper, but eventually she started jogging and pulled way out ahead and out of sight. Right about that time, the guy glanced back over his shoulder and saw me. Not even 2 minutes later, he ducked off the towpath into the woods. 

As I passed the game trail where he left the path, I looked out towards the river to see where he’d gone and what he was doing; he had just disappeared. Vanished. I couldn’t see him or hear him moving through the brush. I kept walking, constantly looking back over my shoulder and into the woods on both sides of the trail. I’d already taken my AirPods out so I could hear what was going on around me. Eventually, about 2 miles down the trail, I met up with the woman coming back from the opposite direction. 

I approached her and said “hello.” Her response? “What’s wrong? What happened?” I told her about the guy, showed her his picture, and described exactly where he’d gone off the path, and which mile marker it was closest to. As I had suspected, she had no idea either of us were behind her on the trail, and didn’t even recall seeing the guy lingering near the bridge, even though I watched her walk right past him. I told her to just be careful and be aware of her surroundings on the way back, and she thanked me. I offered to walk back with her, but she said she’d be ok, she had a knife on her and would take it out until she got to her car. I let her know my girlfriend was on her way, so I’d be ok when she got there in a few minutes. 

About half a mile later, I came to an empty campsite where I was able to stop and wait for my girlfriend, who I’d been texting every 5 minutes to let her know I was ok. I had also shared my location with her on my phone, so she could see exactly where I was until she got there. About 10 minutes later, she came riding up, and we walked back to our cars together. She told me she’d seen the woman from the path while she was unloading her bike, and she’d made it safely back to her car. Apparently the woman was on a video call with someone, which I thought was smart so that if anything did happen, the person on the call could see what was going on and even record it. For the entire 3-ish mile walk back, we didn’t see one other person on the trail until we got to the parking lot, so I’m actually really glad my girlfriend came out to meet me, or I’d have been really creeped out by myself. 

Did I overreact? I mean, it was probably nothing, right? My instincts were telling me everything about this guy was just wrong and I got major creep vibes from him. I’ve been on the canal dozens of times by myself and never been uncomfortable or weirded out by anyone. But what if I was just being paranoid, and because of my paranoia I freaked out some other poor woman, and caused my girlfriend to leave work for no reason?",TwoXChromosomes,30,1630466013.0,12,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/pflb9g/did_i_overreact/
A man took an underskirt photo or video of me.,"I feel attacked, I feel unsafe and gross. I went out to get some snacks for my work tomorrow, and having just come home from my other job, I took a quick shower and put on a dress, knee length. Initially, I was going to the store across the street, but due to curfew it was closed. So I walked farther away from my house, to a second store, but it was closed too. A block away there’s a mini market, so I decided to go there. It’s a pretty lit up street, some people still out and about at 7:30 pm, so i felt relatively safe. 
I didn’t have my phone with me.
I go into the store, buy my snacks, pay. And then I noticed one clerk looking at me, but I shrugged it off. As I was heading out the same clerk was kneeling by the door, apparently cleaning the glass wall. As I crossed the threshold I saw his phone on the floor, front camera facing up. And as I took some steps it dawned on me what he was doing there. I had to stop walking, just a few meters away from where the clerk was. I couldn’t believe what he’d done, I’d seen him several times there and had always been courteous when buying there. I felt dirty, unsafe, and exposed. I stared at him and he noticed, and started doing something with his phone. Not knowing what to do, I went back home.

I told my cousin what happened and she told me to call 911, call in for sexual harassment. I went with the cops to the mini market. We checked the guy’s phone but my picture or video wasn’t there, and the recycling bin was empty, which to me just confirms everything. 

The police took his name and told me to go home. 

My only comfort is that maybe he didn’t get to keep the video/pictures (here’s hoping he didn’t back them up). 

I hate that now I’ll fear wearing dresses and even avoid them. I hate that this guy probably has done this to countless other women. I hate that I live close to that store and I’ll fear bumping into him from now on.

A man just wandered into my workshop and it’s left me feeling so unsettled,"I am a small business owner and my friend and I rent a warehouse that’s split into 2 levels, she works downstairs and I work on the mezzanine level upstairs. There are office that we rent out on my level too. 

The warehouse is in an industrial park, it’s gated and has a one way system to get around it with no parking for the public. There’s a big roller door that stays open during the day and the only people and cars we tend to see are clients, other business owners from the park and delivery drivers, never random people as you can’t really walk in off the street and there is no cut through to the other side.

They doubled back and the kid skips in from the driveway followed by the man, he shouts “Hello?” I’m watching him from the mezzanine and say “Hi, can I help you?” He says “nope, I’m just buying something from down there” (indicates the other warehouses further up) and then to the kid, “wow! Look at all this stuff, don’t touch anything though!” He was very loud and had a very manic vibe. They continue walking into my friends space. I say “Sorry mate, this isn’t a show room, it’s a workshop…” leaving it kind of open ended to see if he was actually looking for one of the tenants or something. He then shouts up at me, with the craziest eyes I’ve ever seen, “Whatever, I was just trying to show the kid some cool stuff!” And grabs the kid and storms off. My friend had no idea what had happened as she was out the back but thanked me profusely for saving her products from sticky fingers and prying eyes. Our male tenant (think typical dad) over heard everything and came out to ask if everything was ok, he was very concerned about the mans tone.

I feel so stupid for letting this get to me so much, I’m a grown woman and I’ve dealt with far worse but it was something about his demeanour and his attitude that rattled me so much. He made me genuinely feel so unsafe and he was an entire level below me! I’m now worried that he may have been scouting the area and had stuck his head in to see what we have. Perhaps it’s past trauma of micro aggressions from men rising to the surface…there wasn’t anything micro about this though - I’m so glad I was so far away from him!",TwoXChromosomes,7,1661402489.0,7,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wx4s8j/a_man_just_wandered_into_my_workshop_and_its_left/
There is a mentally unstable man sitting on my doorstep all day,"

Hey all,

I recently moved into a new apartment, and I have an unexpected problem that requires a but of context.

I live alone, and just moved in a new city. The place I rent is located in a two-story building (old house), where the first floor is occupied by the real-estate agency where I rent. So : I'm the only appartement in the building.

There is two doors to get to my place : my main door that leads to a stairway, and the stairway doors that opens directly on the street. I'm the only person using those doors.

The apt had been empty for a while. When I moved in (*after* I had already signed everything), the real estate agent notified me that a man had taken up the habit of sitting on the doorstep in the street, and that he was occasionally screaming insults and generally being noisy, because he had some unspecified mental problems. She told me he wasn't dangerous, just loud.

What do I do ? I've been here for a week now and I've heard him a few times. The noise doesn't really bother me, but the fact that there is a man in front of my door does make me feel unsafe. He'll know I live alone because I'll me the only one coming and going. And because I'm alone in the building, no one'll hear me if anything happens. I have this (unfounded) fear of him shoving me and getting inside with me. During the day it's fine because there are people working downstairs but at night I'm completely alone.

Is there anything I can do ? *Should* I do anything ? I'd feel guilty getting the cops involved without him having done anything or without having asked him to leave first. But I feel mean telling him to go elsewhere...

I'm in western Europe if that changes anything.",TwoXChromosomes,4,1648225639.0,9,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/tnpqoj/there_is_a_mentally_unstable_man_sitting_on_my/
Was I harassed?,"We live in a small gated community. We moved here a few weeks before covid happened and we haven’t had significant in-person interactions with our neighbours.

I went out for a run at 8:30pm. I was walking when I saw a car parked in front of one of the houses. One lady was there too but she was busy fixing something in the garage.

I couldn’t tell if they were visitors or if they were our neighbours, but they were certainly familiar with whoever lives in that house. I was 20 ft away when I noticed one guy in his 20’s or 30’s positioning himself in the middle of the street. It’s a narrow street and he just stood there staring at me with his feet wide and arms on his side. Aggressive stance—like he was making himself look bigger.

He looked at me and I looked at him too wondering if I knew him. He was staring at me and I wasn’t sure if he even blinked! He was wearing a mask as well.

He didn’t take his eyes away from me and just stood there until I passed right by him. It wasn’t a curious or friendly stare. The way he stood felt aggressive but it’s hard to claim that because he just looked at me and stood there. I was so uncomfortable as this isn’t typical behaviour from friendly neighbours. It felt aggressive I expected to get hit or pulled. I could have walked the other way but my gut told me to not appear intimidated. However, I certainly felt uncomfortable.

Neighbours would usually say hi or hello. Some would just look away. But this guy just stood in the middle of the street and stared at me while I was walking.

I walked back home and didn’t run anymore fearing he might find out where I live. It’s a small gated community and it’s the first time this ever happened to me.

I’m angry because I usually enjoy running at night but now I feel unsafe and uncomfortable. I don’t even want to wear what I wore today and I plan to wear a cap even at night now just to feel safer.

I’m thinking of reporting this incident but I’m not sure if it’s worth reporting because he didn’t really do anything. How do I make sense of this incident?",TwoXChromosomes,1,1615901630.0,14,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/m695sp/was_i_harassed/
Not taken seriously by men," 

Whenever  I try to speak to my colleagues about the problems of women, most of  them just brush it off. I'm sick of hearing that women have it easier  than men, because almost every single day I feel so uncomfortable near  them. Sometimes is the older dude who stares at me in the bus or some  random guy who stops me on the street, trying to get to know me. Other  times I know I'm being followed by some weird dude. Or if I need some  help with any small thing, I feel that they think I owe them so much in  return.

In all of my relationships  I've felt extremely replaceable. I'm so sick of emtpy promises, one guy  told me he had serious thoughts about me, talking about meeting my  parents, going on trips with my family...and a few days after I got  woken up by his girlfriend,(that I knew nothing of), messaging me like  crazy. I've been cheated on a lot, I've been made to feel worthless by  past partners and in general, I feel like men treat me like I am way  waaay below them. I did a lot of things for my partners, but they didn't  really show any appreciation.

I  would call myself a feminist, I always feel very good and safe near  women that I even don't know that well, but sometimes I feel really bad  and unsafe near the men that I know.

My  question is...how can I be taken seriously and respected? How can I  feel safe? Is it possible to trust men again after all this experiences?  I still want to have my own family one day, but I also want to be  treated the way all women should be treated: with appreciation, esteem  and politeness.",TwoXChromosomes,10,1654166977.0,4,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/v3630p/not_taken_seriously_by_men/
Was just lightly assaulted and not sure how to react,"This might be long and rambling… I just need to get this out. 

So… I was walking back to my office after lunch today on a very busy city street. I was smoking a cigarette and this person made the international ‘do you have one for me’ gesture and I said out loud (I was wearing headphones) ‘no, sorry, this is my last one.’ This person decided to more or less bop me on my forehead with their hand. It didn’t hurt. But this person still physically touched me without my consent on the street because I did not have a cigarette for them. I was in shock and disbelief and so all I did was turn to this person and yell ‘do NOT touch people’. There were quite a few people around when this happened. I could tell people noticed but no one did or said a thing. Which I understand, I didn’t want to escalate the situation as is, so why would they want to get involved as a stranger? Part of me is in hysterics, you don’t touch people. You just don’t. Especially right now. But you just DO NOT touch a person no matter what the issue is. I feel violated. I feel unsafe in a city where I usually feel safe (which I know is a privilege in itself). I tried to call the non emergency police line to report, was transferred twice and then hung up on… so I can’t even turn to the police to give a shit. The other part of me feels like I am overreacting. I called my mother who kind of laughed it off, said that she was sorry it happened, but I know her mentality and it’s along the lines of ‘oh in my day we would have hit them back and that would have been the end of it’. I feel stupid for being so violated by such a small act. I’m just not sure how to feel. As a woman especially, to have that happen in broad daylight, to have no one else around me react at all… it just all sucks and I felt extremely vulnerable. The whole thing sucked. And I don’t know if me being upset is right or if I just need to suck it up and deal because it really wasn’t a ‘hit’ as much as a ‘bop’. I just really wish this stupid little thing didn’t happen. You just don’t touch people.",TwoXChromosomes,12,1635884180.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/qld4xb/was_just_lightly_assaulted_and_not_sure_how_to/
Have you ever just had an inexplicable gut feeling about a stranger?,"I haven't told any of my friends or family about this. I really have no one to tell, so I was hoping I can vent here.

I changed a few minor details of the story just to avoid identification. I hope that's not a problem.

To the main story. There is a community centre in my city that I used to frequent all the time in January/February 2018. It's always very cold in my area at that time of the year (no surprise lol), and they held an open gym once every week, and I tried to go whenever I could. It was usually just parents and their young children playing. Everyone was always friendly, I got to know some of the people who frequented the centre, and going there became a regular thing for me. 

At the community centre, my brother and I would play tennis for about half an hour or forty five minutes, and then we would leave. Not one time did I feel uncomfortable. The staff were always friendly and I never felt like I needed to avoid anyone there. 

Now I'll try to keep the melodrama to a minimum.

One day, there was this one guy who showed up. I didn't know who he was, my brother didn't recognize him, no one else in the recreation centre seemed to know who he was, and he didn't bring a child with him. He was leaning in the doorway right beside the small section of the open gymnasium where my brother and I were playing tennis. 

I am really not a person who is easily off put by strangers. I can get along with most people, and I can't remember ever really ever feeling threatened in any situation. In a public place like this, where I was already familiar with everyone, I never had a reason to feel unsafe. But this man scared me. 

I noticed he wasn't wearing any sort of uniform, like all of the staff usually do. He was wearing this garish golf shirt and matching shorts that stuck out in my peripheral vision. He kept commenting on me playing.  I watched him out of the corner of my eye the entire time. He never commented on my brother, or shouted out to any of the other people who were there. After a few minutes I started to get more and more uneasy. 

From anyone else I would have just brushed it off. He didn't make any comments on my ass or tits or anything like that. Objectively he gave me no reason to feel uncomfortable. But I'm sure everyone knows that gut feeling, where you're just thinking, *I don't know exactly what's going on, but I need to get out of here now.* 

I told my brother I needed a break and made a run for the bathroom. I tried to put myself together, told myself that I was making a big deal out of nothing. So I tried to get back into the gymnasium. Turns out that all of the functioning doors into the gymnasium were blocked or not working, except one. The one the man was leaning against, which meant everyone had to squeeze very tightly beside him to get in or out. 

I got tired of that feeling. I made up my mind after a few more serves. I told my brother that we were leaving early, and I think he could tell I was anxious, too. We put everything away and went home. My brother never asked and I never told him. We just never went back. 

I still can't really describe that feeling completely accurately. I've never felt it since and I don't want to. It just felt like the deepest dread in the pit of my stomach, worse than any anxiety I've ever had. 

If you read this far, thank you!!

I wanted to ask, has anyone else here felt like that - uneasy in a situation that would be objectively innocent to anyone else? Part of me feels like I used that poor man as an excuse to victimize myself, but I seriously felt like I was in some sort of danger then.

Can't even go out for a nice walk during the daylight,"It's finally getting nice where I live and I'm trying to get back into being active since I've had some health issues that have kept me from doing so. I went out for a walk, excited to listen to my new podcast and across from a park filled with children of all places, an old man is walking behind me and starts yelling. ""Do you want to hear my joke? Stop, I want to tell you my joke"". Lucky for me a nice, young guy told the older creep to leave me alone and that I didn't want to hear his joke. I thanked the nice guy and walked across the street to get away from the old creep. 

I was shaken at this point and didn't know where to go because I wasn't able to follow my planned path anymore. I walked towards the park with the kids and their parents to be near some other people. The old creep crossed the street too and started walking in my direction. He ended up stopping to talk to the parents of the kids but that didn't stop me from checking behind me every 5 seconds on my walk back home.

My walk was cut short, I was shaken and close to tears, and didn't get to listen to my podcast. The sun was still up and I was wearing ugly clothes and had no makeup and my hair wasn't done. Nothing will stop these guys! 

I'm home now and safe and my husband gave me a hug but it's ruined my entire evening. I feel unsafe now in my suburban neighborhood. I keep thinking his joke was probably something sexual but it could have also been an old, lonely man just looking to chat.

"I've been living in an unsafe area since my senior year in college 3 years ago. Today, the inevitable finally happened to me. In broad daylight. After being first in line for the PD for over an hour, I finally hung up. Should I have called 911?","I was raped when I was 15 years old by someone I knew well.  I thought that only walking my dog while the sun was up or very early in the evening (if my fiance wasn't around to do it) would keep me safe.  Well...  This happened while it was still completely sun-lit out.

I was walking my dog around my building and a guy called me through his window to ask directions to a building.  He looked to be mid-30's, which is very old to live in student housing, but my Dad started balding around 23 years old, so I figured he was just one of those unlucky guys.  He looked nice enough.

He kept telling me he didn't understand the directions to the building he was asking for (claimed he couldn't find it on his phone because it died).  It was two turns away.  When I was about through explaining that, I saw his hand moving up and down where the window had previously blocked it off.  Less than 5 seconds later, I saw the tip of his penis and he was masturbating vigorously.  By the time I started running away with my dog he had orgasmed and said, ""You're a real cutie,"" threw his semen at me, and started begging me to come back.

Well, I'm much too nice, but I'm not a fucking *idiot.*  I had gotten far enough away when he came that when he threw his semen at me it missed and landed somewhere on the sidewalk.

I've never considered myself naive, and I've *always* taken precautions in this complex because I've seen girls get beaten and forced into cars, drug deals, and have heard shoot-outs.  Now I'm paranoid, because this happened in broad daylight RIGHT on the other side of my building.  If I had wanted to, I could've started my dog's walk there just by walking to the other exit, as I sometimes do.

I waited on hold for over an hour after calling the PD.  When I called, their automated message had said I'm first in line.  I eventually hung up because it was making my anxiety worse.  I plan on going to the PD to file a report tomorrow since I have nothing else to do.

What I want to know, is...  Is that a legitimate reason to have called 911 in the first place?  I didn't want to tie up resources from people who had actually been touched and hurt, shot, etc.  But now, I don't know.

**UPDATE:  I ended up going to the PD since my phone died when I tried to call the non emergency line again.  They took the event very seriously.  I received a phone call this evening (about 28 hours after the incident) saying someone reported something similar, described him as looking the same (even the same shirt, ugh...), similar sedan, and whatnot.  He was at the student housing complex across the street from mine.**

**I had a couple of panic attacks and nightmares last night about what happened, but I've been fine since waking up this morning.  Just very cautious and aware of my surroundings.**

**Thank you all for your input!  That was a situation I never thought I'd be in and, as a result, I really had no idea how to respond.  Hopefully I don't need this knowledge again in the future, but I'd rather have it and not need it.**

Why does everyone yell/honk at me when I'm running/biking?,"Don't know if this is really relevant, but I need to vent somewhere. Plus none of my male friends have ever had this problem sooo...

I don't have a car, so I get around by bike. I live in a somewhat sketchy town so riding around alone is not exactly the most fun activity.

Why does everyone yell at girls on the street? Is it really so rare to see a woman on a bike? Leave me alone! I don't care if you think I look pretty or whatever. Let me get to my destination in peace.

Today I nearly shit my pants because I saw a truck very slowly pull up to me as I was going down the street. They were matching my speed and I seriously thought I was going to get kidnapped or something. Thankfully, it was just  a classmate who found the absolute *perfect* time to chat, so I didn't end up in a ditch like I feared I would.

I don't care if you're a friend, coworker, or classmate. When I am running or biking, I am in the zone. I'm disheveled, miserable, drenched in sweat, and out of breath. 

I feel unsafe enough as it is, especially as a woman. You're not being cute or funny by cruising next to me at 5-15 mph and trying to get my attention. I'm usually not afraid of strangers but if you pull up next to me or start acting sketchy I will have a heart attack.

"I just got followed home and I'm kind of shaken up and I don't feel safe anymore. I've a history of anxiety problems and depression which I have under control, but I'm scared this could start something new. Can anyone give me any advice?","He was walking on the other side of the road, coming towards me. When he saw me he sort of shouted something, I don’t know what, and started smiling whilst staring at me. I kept walking, and after a few seconds looked behind me: he was in the middle of jogging across the road over to my side, still staring and smiling. When he got to the other side he changed his original direction and starting walking towards me. I kept walking and looking behind me, and could see that he was walking quite fast, continuously staring at me and smiling. I realised he was going to catch up, so I decided to stop and make it look like I was crossing over to the other side. He passed me, then stopped a little way down the road at the traffic lights and hit the button to also cross the road. I stood on the side of the road and didn’t cross, and he stood there watching me. At this point, two men were walking towards me, and I decided to start talking to them. Just before I started talking to them, I think he realized what I was planning on doing, because he quickly turned away and started walking down the street.
The two men I talked to didn’t speak any English at all, so unfortunately I couldn’t explain the situation. But I think they recognized I was kind of in a stressful situation. I really really didn’t want to turn my back on this creepy guy, so I stood with them for a minute whilst I watched him walk off. I then walked with them for a little bit, in the opposite direction to the creepy creepy guy, and called one of my flatmates to come pick me up.
I called the non-emergency police number when I got home, just to say that a man had followed me and was acting pretty strangely.


And yeah, that’s pretty much it. The guy thoroughly creeped me out and made me feel very vulnerable and unsafe. I’m not feeling great, heh. I’ve never had someone be so obviously intimidating and creepy towards me, and I kind of don’t feel safe at all now and very on-edge, heh. But I wanted to post this whilst it was still fresh in my memory.


So I'm sat at home now, feeling just incredibly on edge and not safe at all. My flatmates have all gone to bed and I just feel really really unsafe and anxious, like I want to cry.


Honestly, throughout all of it I think I kept my cool pretty well. I was very calm. I was shaking once I realized that he was following me, but I was calm. Once I was sure he was following me, I made sure to get a good look at him, and also make it clear that I was aware he was following me. But I'm just, I'm also pissed off as well. Like, a less than ten minute interaction with some random creep and now I'm feeling like I'm scared to leave the house. Or walk home at night. I'm fairly new to the area and generally felt very safe.

I am still shaken from last night's Tinder experience.,"I'm not new to Tinder, as I've been using it on and off for years, but last night was the first time where I felt very unsafe and could have become one of those horror stories you hear about. 

I matched with a guy last night and we started chatting. Seemed like a nice guy - we were both down for hooking up and maybe FWB if it all worked out. My date for the night cancelled on me, so we made plans for the evening: I'd come over to his place and we'd drink, eat pizza, and hook up. I was getting good vibes from this guy, so we switched to text. It immediately went downhill from here as he started asking for ""previews"". I sent him a pic of me dressed up, and he pushed for me to lose the clothes. I said no, not comfortable sending nudes. He pushed again and I said no, you can have me without the clothes when I get there. He then pushed again and I said no, seriously, it can wait. He ended up sending me a dick pic and I told him the Uber was getting to my place soon. 

I got into the Uber and let him know when I should be by his place. It's a long drive (45 mins) and he didn't text back at all during the ride. I started getting bad vibes about 10 minutes from his place, but said it was just nerves since it's been a while. When we pulled up to his place, alarm bells started going off: a car parked in the street and a truck in the driveway and the house was dark with only the kitchen light on. I get out of the Uber and called the guy, but it went to voicemail. I still didn't have a text from him either. I knew I had to get out of there, but I was in a suburban area. There wasn't any nearby gas stations, restaurants, or other public places I could go to bunker down and safely call a ride. I opted to stand under a bright street light and out of sight of the house while I called another Uber, which thankfully showed up in record time. 

I got home safely, but broke down once I got in. I've done some pretty risky stuff in the past, including going to a guy's place after matching and talking for a bit. In a way, I thought I was invincible because those risky experiences ended up going fine. I'm also just so confused: what was his end game? Was it all a ploy to get nudes? What was the point of giving me your address (assuming it was his) with the intent of us hooking up and then ghost? I have been wrecking my brain over the whole situation. I think it was also a huge reminder that I'm a young woman and I should have known better. So many people tell you to ""be safe"" and you have to memorize all these other tips even when you go on a normal date with a guy from a dating app. 

I'm still processing it all and have since deleted my profile too. I'm very glad that the worst thing that happened in this situation is losing $100 in Uber rides (it's expensive where I live). Please please please don't do what I did. If you're going to hook up with a stranger off a dating app, go for drinks first or meet up in a public spot. Do not ignore the bad vibes or gut feelings either, and get out of any situation that is setting your alarm bells off.",TwoXChromosomes,18,1602421033.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/j94yd5/i_am_still_shaken_from_last_nights_tinder/

  I broke up with my boyfriend two days ago. I should’ve done it in the first few weeks we were even together but I finally got the courage and ended it. I immediately cut all contact, blocked him on everything, and put his things out to pick up, hoping it would go peacefully. I guess I should’ve known better because within the next few hours he called me and texted me on three different numbers, which I blocked one after one. There was silence for a bit, I thought maybe all was well. 

  Apparently not, because last night I got a call from my friend, saying he called her and said he is heading to my house. He is a big guy, like a really big guy, and he’s very scary, and he’s violent. I closed all the windows, all the curtains, locked the doors, and called the police. He ended up not showing, thank god, but the police officer showed up to talk to me. This guy was lovely, the first thing he said to me was “how did you even get involved in this guy?” We talked for about an hour, about how people like that don’t change, about how if I feel unsafe again to call right away, I showed him the dents on my car that my ex left from kicking it after I locked myself in to hide from him. I told him about the videos I have of him threatening to kill me. He opened a file (I think? I’m not very legal savvy) and asked if I wanted to pursue harassment and I said no, as long as he leaves me alone. I should have said yes. 

  Once again, my friend called me today around noon, saying he’s coming and he says if I don’t speak to him when he arrives “he’s leaving my car in pieces”. And this time I’m home alone. So I immediately called the police again. 

  Unfortunately in all the stress and madness of the night before I completely forgot the name of the police officer I’d spoken to the night before or I would’ve asked for him... because this second cop was absolutely unbelievable. My ex showed up probably five minutes after I made the call, started banging on the door and yelling for me to come out. I sat inside and waited 5-10 minutes until he left, thankfully not doing any damage other than scaring the shit out of me. The cop called right after, and the conversation (to the best of my memory) went like this after I gave him the basic of what had happened and told him I’d already had someone here the night before: 

  Him: *sighs* So what? You guys are just having a fight or something? 

  Me: No, I have broken up with him and I want no contact, he’s harassing me and showing up at my house. 

  Him: Well unfortunately there’s nothing we can do other than tell him not to talk to you, but he’ll need three warnings (*not what the other cop said last night, I don’t know what is the truth*) so let us know if he does contact you again and we COULD maybe get a no contact order. But if we do that you do realize you can’t contact him either, right?

  I was shocked. I haven’t been contacting him. I never wanted to again.  I’m calling the police because he’s making me feel unsafe and in return I’m getting the feeling that this guy thinks I’m just a drama queen and this is some silly lovers quarrel. I wanted to scream at him all the things he’d done to me in the last few months, but I just said okay, gave him my exes information, and it turns out he was driving right in front of him. So he pulls him over and says he’ll call me back. I’m still feeling like I’m not being taken seriously at all here. The police officer was never even going to come to my house even though I’d been transferred straight to 911 after talking to the non emergency line. If he was in the car BEHIND my ex, he would have been heading in the exact opposite direction of my house. Ten minutes later, he calls me back and says this: 

  “I talked to him and he said he’d leave you alone, but he wants to charge you with assault and says he has witnesses (WHAT?!), he said if you contact him again, he’ll call us and I don’t blame him. Hopefully this is over now. Have a good day” 

  THIS IS HOW PEOPLE GET KILLED. I still have no idea what yarn my ex spun to him, I am confused but not surprised. I feel so stupid for saying no when the operator asked if there was domestic abuse. I feel so stupid for not saying he sexually assaulted me just the other night. Maybe if I had some sort of trail this guy would have believed me but then again, maybe not, he didn’t believe me from the get go. I know there is nothing on me that my ex could charge me for, but that’s not my concern. This is why people don’t call the police. This is why people get hurt and killed. I’m so upset and I don’t know what to do. Hopefully this is over but I am not counting on it. I think I’m going to call and try and find the officer that actually cared and believed me, he stayed posted up at the end of my street for the rest of the night, but I don’t know if that’s even necessary if my ex leaves me alone. I don’t know what to do.

"There is no good response when men are being inappropriate, creepy, or misogynistic.","I am so frustrated. There is no good response when men are being inappropriate, creepy, or misogynistic. Either you don’t respond or react and it feels like you let them win and they will continue that behavior, or you try to say something and risk the situation becoming unsafe. 

Twice in one day today I had to deal with this. First, I was with my boyfriend at a dirt bike race asking the people running the race if they had a part we could borrow when another racer was there and said he had the part and we could borrow it “if your girlfriend will give me a hug”. We were so uncomfortable and neither of us said anything, we just left to find the part from someone else. It was upsetting feeling like we just let that behavior go, but we just moved on.

Later, we were riding bicycles single file down a main road in our town (in the bike lane) when a car cuts across a from the left lane and pulls up too fast and too close to me. I look over surprised and in the car is two guys and one says “yeah she is hot”. At this point I am so annoyed with men thinking stuff like this is okay so I flip them the bird as they are driving away with the flow of traffic. I hear them make some noise and then suddenly they swing right in front of me, into the bike lane, coming super close to hitting me and laughing. I yelled that their dicks still weren’t going to get any bigger and my boyfriend yelled misogynistic pigs at them and I swerved up onto the sidewalk as soon as I could. We turned down a side street to go a longer way off the main roads. 

It was such a scary and disheartening experience. As a woman I deal with these comments and interactions constantly and it feels like there is no right way to respond. Obviously there are other ways to respond than nothing and flipping someone off/cursing at them, but sometimes it feels like there is no in between. In these cases I am not even sure what I could have said. They don’t deserve a classy, educating response, they deserve nothing. I shouldn’t always have to be polite and patient and appeasing or fear for my life.

A bouncer picked me up without my consent after which I was followed by a stranger,"*TL;DR: A bouncer picked me up under the arms when I was having a panic attack and a strange man followed me as I tried to go home after.*

A bit of context, sometimes when I am out at a party or club I can get a bit overwhelmed. I basically start hyperventilating and can't really communicate. When this happens I just need a moment in a less overwhelming environment to collect myself and I am good to go back about partying. My friend knows this and will walk me to a quiet spot to collect myself when he sees this.

A few days ago we were at this club and I had an episode. I didn't catch it in time to tell him I needed to get out for a moment but he saw and walked me out to the fenced-off smokers' area outside the club. I am in the middle of an episode and doing all I can to breathe normally and not cry as I collapsed in a corner. I am away from most other people and because of the fences I am not easy to see from outside the club.

Almost the very moment I collapse the bouncer comes up and starts trying to pull at my arms. I think he said I couldn't be there and had to leave, and maybe he said why but all I could do was shrink away from him repeating, ""Please don't touch me, please don't touch me. I just need a minute."" My friend is trying to calm me down and trying to explain to the bouncer that this happens sometimes and I just need a moment to recover, the bouncer is insisting I need to leave. This goes back and forth for a while and I am doing my best to get my thoughts in order. I am eventually able to address this bouncer and tell him I will be fine if I can just have 1 minute, 60 seconds without people touching me or talking to me. The bouncer says that I have had enough time and if I am able to be rude I am able to move. He then comes up behind me where I am sitting on the ground and takes me under the arms to carry me across the street so I am off the club's property. I would have burst into full-on crying if I hadn't been so shocked and just want to go home, but my coat is still in the club and the bouncer will not let me go and get it. Eventually, my friend is allowed to collect my coat and as I am waiting for him two different men tell me I should have handled it differently and then I wouldn't have been kicked out.

I get my coat and my mind is reeling. I just want to go home. I don't remember why my friend didn't go with me but I know I insisted I was fine and would just go home. I am walking to where my bike is when I realise I am not recovered and still just need a moment. I sink to the ground and this stranger starts standing over me. I am crying but keep telling him, ""I am fine, it's fine, please leave, I'm fine.""

He will not leave and I think he kept saying something about going with him as he worked nearby. I have to push him away from me to be able to get up and walk away. This guy is following me and keeps trying to talk to me. Somewhere down the street he suddenly offers me a beer and is trying to make me stop to talk to him.

I am usually very good at dealing with unwanted attention. I can stand my ground and get men to leave me alone and have never felt unsafe walking alone at night even when strange men talk to me, But this time I am in tears, I can't think straight and all I want is to be left alone and go home. I made my way to a bar I know the staff at and even though they are closed and not allowed to let anyone in they open the door and let me stand in the doorway. The bouncer from this place walks me to my bike and I can go home safely.

It has been a few days and I was just startled when a security guard in the supermarket turned toward me. I know how lucky I am that I rarely have to deal with situations like this and even in my state of confusion I was certain I could have protected myself if need be. But I am shaken and so fucking angry.

"I stood up for an elderly woman at Dollar Tree, and then cried my eyes out.","Something just happened that I’ve been told is important to share. I am not in any way looking for a pat on the back, I have just realized in recent months that talking about this stuff and exposing injustice no matter how small are steps towards a better world. I used to think this was baloney, and that one person can’t make a difference, but hey, let’s all try together.

Here’s what happened:

I was just at the Dollar Tree, very close to a few senior communities. I was just going in for a few pieces of glassware to hold makeup brushes on my vanity but turned into something more that had me break down in tears once I was back in my car trying to reach my boyfriend on the phone.

I’ll try not to make this too long but this is about my experience standing up for an elderly woman. While something like talking to strangers in public, especially alone, is way out of my comfort zone, the loud conversation I overheard prompted me to take a stand.

While I was browsing the front section upon entering the store I overheard a loud male voice say “Do you not seize opportunities when they come to you!?”...I continued to listen, “I might not see you ever again, or maybe I will, just take my number” (she interjected with a meek “No thank you”). He went on, “maybe tomorrow--maybe a year from now you’ll call. Look, I think you are attractive and intelligent…” I moved towards the voice and found this elderly man (maybe mid-late 70’s) talking at this elderly woman about the same age, both of them seemed to be in good health and more than decent shape.

Their conversation/him talking at her continued for several minutes loudly enough for most of the store to hear. There were only about three or four other shoppers in view and one cashier at the front. I then purposely got in this man’s eye-line and made brief eye contact so he would know I was there listening. He asked her again even louder making pointed hand gestures “Do you not seize opportunities?!” she said timidly, “Well...apparently not.” And yet, he continued to beg and frame her as foolish for passing on the chance to take his phone number.

I just thought to myself “I have to do something...I have to say something”....I’m tearing up as I type this because I can’t help but feel I should have done more. I can’t remember every piece of dialogue because it all went so fast but here’s what happened:

I walk right up to the woman’s side, almost between them, I look up at the man (he was about 6ft+) and say with a stern voice matching his volume (hoping others in store can hear) “Pardon me, I don’t mean to be rude or interrupt” then make eye contact with the woman and ask “M’am did you already tell this man ‘No’?”

Woman: nods her head yes and says “Yyes” with a stutter.

The man seemed flabbergasted and I could see him getting visibly upset. He said, still loud, “Excuse Me”

I repeated, “Like I said, I don’t want to interrupt but this woman has already said no to you, she doesn’t want to talk to you so you should stop.” (My heart was beating so fast and my voice was shakey and I couldn’t exactly think of the right words to say).

Man: “Oh alright, yeah, I understand! You and your feminism!”

I turned to the woman again, she gently grabbed and held up my hand in both of hers and looked into my eyes with a strange combination of appreciation and fear.

I ask, “M’am do you want to continue to talk with this man?” (I think he was continuing to say things to me but I was solely focused on this lady).

She shyly said, “It’s okay, I can….still listen.” and tapped my hand and thanked me.

I said “Oh okay” and turned to the man and said “I just wanted to make it clear. She already said no.” and I walked away respecting the woman’s wish to stay by him and knowing she wasn’t in any physical danger.

Once I was out of sight, he continued to speak to her and shouted this part. “Certain people choose to eavesdrop on certain things!” I was in the immediate next aisle and shouted back “The whole store can hear you sir!” and he said “WELL GOOD!”

My blood was boiling but I had to calm my breathing….I considered dropping my things and leaving immediately. But I wanted to make sure he didn’t keep following her.

I went about my business and the store was silent. I saw that he was now in the back of the store and I watched the elderly woman leave with no shopping bags and boarded the little shuttle waiting outside.

I collected the rest of my items and saw the man was now browsing the very back of the store. I was, of course, still upset. While he was still in my field of view, and knowing the lady had left, I wanted to go up to him again and say “By the way, it’s not called being a feminist, it’s called being a decent human being!”-----But I didn’t. He already acted like he was being attacked in that earlier encounter, at this point he’d take anything I say as a threat.

I am still angry that he made it seem like I was the one with the problem...and that somehow him speaking to this lady in what, in his time, was a “gentlemanly fashion” made the situation okay. He looked at and spoke to me like I was attacking HIM as he publicly shouted at me for being a feminist in such a negative/accusatory tone…like I’M some liberal whack job and he’s the victim...

Anyway, so that’s it. Bought my stuff...went to my car...and cried on the phone. (Spoiler, I’m still crying.)

Here’s why. It hit me all at once. The look of fear in that lady’s eyes...imagining the countless women throughout our present and past mistreated by men or made to feel like they are the ones with the problem. This is real life. Real everyday women have been dealing with this garbage for so long. Not just in the movies...it didn’t just “happen a long time ago” it was, and it is real.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you listening...reading? I have some other thoughts...this next part is just for me to get out (as if I hadn’t said enough).

Funny (well not funny but)...Coincidentally, I had recently been talking to my boyfriend and some other friends about that fact that I’ve decided that maybe I should be more open about my personal struggles with sexual harassment and assault. I’ve always thought that the world doesn’t need a #metoo story from ME because my assaulter has already been criminally charged, put on the registry, and is out of my life. BUT I’m going to now semi-publicly share my story. If you want details you can ask me directly. I was sexually assaulted when I was 8. (Aw man see now I’m crying again.) If you don’t know, I went through a really rough 8-year custody battle following my parents’ divorce in a 90’s family court that systematically favored mothers over fathers. It took me getting assaulted by my stepfather for my dad to get the full custody of me that he should have already had. My biological mother is a diagnosed psychopath with personality disorders, it took this for the court to let me live with my dad.

Here’s my story: My mom and I run errands and stop by the church up the street from where we were staying at the time (we bounced around a lot, she had a lot of fake addresses). ANYWAY, while sitting in the pews in an empty church she said she noticed that I was starting to warm up to her new husband. (Like most kids, I hated anyone that my single parents dated because I wanted my own parents to live happily ever after but after their wedding I started to be nice to him to make my mom happy.) So she said she noticed us getting closer and then told me she wanted me to stop accepting shoulder rides from him---stop holding his hand---stop sitting next to him---don’t let him run his fingers through my hair. I was EIGHT. I was like...ok!....

We leave the church, and a few hours later she drops me off back “home” while she goes back to church for some kind of bible study group. ALONE….with him. Our room was a re-purposed pantry somewhere in some old lady’s house. I felt super awkward staying there so I never left this very narrow room. There was a long dresser, one bed, and a little tv stand with a microwave on it (that’s unsafe lol). There was nowhere else to sit so I sat on the bed and put on a vhs movie, I don’t remember which. My stepdad climbed on the bed with me and I thought nothing of it as I watched the tv. He began massaging my legs, I was wearing stretchy pants like little girls do. He worked his way up and I was like… “What are you doing?” he said “It’s okay” with a reassuring smile as he worked his way up then said “You’re going to like it” and he pulled back the waistband of my pants &amp; underwear. (I’m 8, I didn’t know what sex was, I didn’t know that it’s not called a “Pah-china”). Anyways, he put his fingers on my crotch and I got goosebumps and didn’t know why but I somehow knew something was wrong so I jumped off the bed and yelled “NO” and ran.

I ran out to the backyard and don’t remember where I ended up and I remember my mom coming home quickly after. I didn’t tell her. It was all so strange to me and I was a quiet kid (shocking right?). Luckily my it was my dad’s time to pick me up like 15min later. I said nothing in the car ride to my dad’s house. On our way into the house, I said “Something...happened.” My dad was my best friend and I am so glad that he always listened to me and valued what I had to say no matter how young I was.

Anyways (for like the tenth time), that was my first sexual experience. I won’t go on to do anymore preaching. I’ll just close by saying this--let’s all make an effort to not only listen more but to stand up for each other.",TwoXChromosomes,52,1552616029.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/b1960d/i_stood_up_for_an_elderly_woman_at_dollar_tree/
"I'm sick of feeling vulnerable as a female, especially when alone.","I was driving home from my in-laws's house across town and I tried to pass a car going under the speed limit in the left lane. When the two young men in the car saw my attempt, they sped up just enough to cut me off, then followed me. They even dropped back and got behind me. I tried changing lanes, I turned a few times, sped up to put space between us, but they kept following. I finally turned into an apartment complex near my place of living and parked in front of the camera on their office building. They jammed on the breaks when they saw the camera and me calling someone, reversed out and sped away. I think I later saw the car parked a few streets from where I live. 
I'm sick of feeling vulnerable and exposed to potential danger, especially when I am alone. I have to walk my dog by myself in the very early hours before the sun comes up, and I feel unsafe in my rather dark area at least once most walks. I hate having to be on alert for anything because I am a lone woman sometimes, or having to call a male or police because I need help (I know to get help when you need it, and I do). 
I wish people would just be decent human beings and think of how a woman that they love in their life would feel if this happens to that woman they love.

I have an issue with one of my bf's friends (A) excusing indecent behavior of another one of my bf's friends (B).,"I feel like crap to say the least. To make a confusing story less confusing, I'll start by telling about friend B first:

He has a hard time understanding social cues, and have problems knowing where people's boundaries are. He did not R me, but he crossed my boundaries several times. You see, I don't like when people touch me, my boyfriend is not included in that. I can hug, but I prefer not to.   
December 2019 I was at a party with my boyfriend (back then he was a flirt), and people was out of the apartment leaving me alone in the living room, I was tired and laid down on the couch to relax a bit, then I heard someone walk in the room and towards me, I figured it was my boyfriend, so I opened my eyes just to see it was his friend standing way too close to me, and then proceeds to climb on top of me to.... hug? Like I said, I don't like that, and I froze. My boyfriend came in and was in super hero mode, asking loudly what the heck was going on, and the friend apologized. That incident made me cautious of him.

Fast forward to one month ago: My boyfriend was hosting a covid friendly part. Even though I don't live together with my boyfriend, I was still co-hosting, so I made sure everyone was alright, cleaning and tidying stuff up when needed. The same friend was distressed over a girl he was seeing, so I talked to him and listened. I gave advice when he asked. All fine and dandy. The party was coming to an end and the said friend came up to hug me. Since I was in a good mood, I hugged him back, and he spoiled it my grabbing my butt cheek. I pushed him away from me asking what the heck he was thinking and rushed away. Mood was ruined and I wanted to cry, but noone had seen it, so I was afraid I read too much into it (still am today). I then pulled him aside warning him to never lay his hands on me again. He again apologized, now I wasn't just cautious, I felt violated and didn't want to see him again. I told my boyfriend what happened when we were alone, while ugly crying. My boyfriend was a champ again.

Now to friend A: He has never really liked me, and I had never known why until last night. He has softened up to me though, but it doesn't make any difference for me. I am a quite analytical person, but I never claim to be an expert in anything. I love psychology, I have a special interest in spectrum disorders. Being on the spectrum myself, that's one of many interests I try to understand a lot about. The other interests aren't relevant for this story. I wrote an essay in psych class on spectrum disorders, got top graded for in, but I am still not an expert. But I love to share knowledge about the subject, and that's what I did the day I met A and my bf. Both of them was on the spectrum and I talked to bf about it and we were both excited about it. A, however, thought I was kind of a show off ""know it all"" kind of person, who defines people by diagnosis, so he was cautious of me. It was never my intentions. I know I can come of as intimidating, but I never mean any harm. I have a hard time seeing and knowing when I'm too intense about certain subjects, but I am constantly working on it, but it doesn't help when people doesn't say it to my face. He had never done that, not until last night.

Last night: Restrictions has been more or less lifted in my country, so my boyfriend and I went out to an amazing bar where some cool people and awesome friends also were. The night was progressing very well, and my boyfriend told me that friend A and B would stop by. I wasn't afraid of B, because we were out public and he couldn't do anything to me. Friend B is hosting a birthday party today, which I am not attending because of what he has done. Friend A asked me why I wasn't attending, and being drunk, I trusted him enough to tell him about what friend B has done (big big BIG mistake). He said ""I have known him for many years, and he has never behaved like that towards me"" and ""he was drunk, he didn't know what he was doing"" and ""He didn't mean to effend you"". I had no idea how to react, so I just nodded and smiled while he talked and talked and never gave me a chance to explain. I wanted to go drink my beer, so I said that, but beer was gone, which just soured my mood even more. Then I saw him and my boyfriend having a private conversation, and after being invalidated I got super paranoid, and just wanted to be alone, drink my new beer and head home.  
My boyfriend came to talk to me, and I wasn't exactly the happiest girl and really just wanted to be left alone for a while, but he could feel I was upset and insisted I told him what was wrong. I kept saying ""not now"" until I just had enough and told him to leave me alone. And he walked away. I assumed he went back to talk to A and B, but I couldn't see him. I checked the transport back to my place, but it was so difficult to get home. I texted my boyfriend that, and he replied ""too late"", which means he had left me there at the bar. We texted back and forth, and he was really hurt by my rejection so he had left for the train station. I grabbed my stuff and left right then and there, pleading him to stay where he was so we could talk, which he was reluctant to.

The walk to him was not pretty. I had a huge panic attack and gasped for air while bawling my eyes out. I finally found him, but it wasn't a happy renunion. In his eyes I was a cruel woman, who rejects those who cares for her. And he was so disappointed in me. I told him off by saying that he was about to leave his girlfriend alone in the middle of the night, and that he knew that transport back to my place was hell and that I would have to walk miles through sketchy areas to come home. We did plan to sleep at his place from the beginning, but I'm always checking the transport to my place anyway.

I felt like crap when I woke up. We spoke and he told me his point of view, and I tried to understand him the best I could. I then told him the danger a woman is in when she's alone on the streets in the middle of the night, especially when she's intoxicated. I told him I have had people do that to me before and how unsafe I felt every time. He has had ex partners who has lashed out after they told him to leave them alone, so he assumed I would too.

  
I told him, that I forgive him this time, but if he does stuff like that again, I wouldn't be able to trust him. And honestly, I don't trust him that much right now, and it breaks my heart. I don't trust A and B anymore either. But the blame is solely on me, since I made the mistake to trust in the wrong person, and then piss of the person I love the most. I might have forgiven my boyfriend, but I haven't forgiven myself yet.

One of the regular customers at my work is starting to scare me.,"Firstly, I'm on mobile and I don't post much on reddit so I apologise for bad formatting, typos, etc.

Anyway, I work at a cafe owned by a husband and wife with a LOT of regular customers, and a big part of the job that they really want us to nail is being friendly to them, smiling and saying hello as soon as we see them. Mostly they're retirees, but there's one guy who comes in to get a takeaway coffee a few times a week who has always made me uncomfortable but recently it's getting worse.

When I started, I didn't really talk to him much because I mostly serve tables, not takeaway customers, but one day while I was by the coffee machine refilling sugar pots he starts chatting with me waiting for his takeaway. I'm not a very outgoing person but I humoured him until he started asking me things like what alcohol I drink, where I go at night, what bars I like to go to - I answered truthfully, I don't really drink and I never go out (I live in what I guess you'd consider a small country town, so going out drinking is a hassle and just not my idea of a good time anyway). He starts mentioning a few local bars by name, trying to suggest that we should go together, and I shut the conversation down and think no more of it once he leaves.


Since then, whenever he comes in he makes a point of saying hello to me, and seems to spend most of his time staring at me. He stopped coming for a few months and I forgot about him, until one day he shows up and sits down in the outdoor seating section with a friend for lunch. I don't handle this section, my boss(es) normally do, but the husband was making coffees and the wife was taking an order or something so I just took their lunch over, no big deal. He tries to strike up a conversation again but it's a busy day so I just leave and as I turn around I hear his friend say ""ooh, is that the one?"" and I'm a little concerned that dude's been away for months but has been talking to people about me.


 I think I forgot to mention this, but he's probably close to 40, and I'm in my 20's. Anyway, since then I see him pretty regularly when I'm leaving work and he has a tendency to come up to me just outside my field of vision and say hello, and then just stare at me, which I find really unsettling. 

And then, this past Saturday at work, he comes in for his coffee and by now I'm pretty sick of him and feeling like I'm being watched all the time so I try to stay towards the back of the shop while he talks to my boss (the wife - it's just me, her, and two other girls on as it's late in the day). Eventually I run out of things to do and have to move up to the front of the cafe and he comes up to me and asks if I like some band that has a show coming up in town soon - I immediately say no, and my coworker gives him his coffee and he leaves. 

My boss tells me that while I was clearing the tables in the back of the cafe he was asking her about me, saying he already had tickets to this show, and that he wanted to ask me to go. She told him he can't, I have a boyfriend (I have a pretty solid relationship I've been happy in for about seven years now) but he shrugged it off and went to talk to me about it anyway. Then when I finished work, I texted my boyfriend to come and get me and went to go run some errands before he arrived, and didn't even get to the end of the street before creepy guy comes up behind me again and does his usual ""hello"" and stared at me again.  

I'm probably reading too much into it but the way he goes out of his way to speak to me and get my attention makes me really fucking uncomfortable, and I said as much to my boss on Saturday. 


I'm sitting in the break room at work about to start my shift and I feel really anxious that he's going to show up again, but I also feel like maybe I'm being stupid and paranoid - there's just something in the way he acts and looks at me that makes me feel unsafe. I've told a few friends about it and they agree with me, but I've never been in this situation before and I don't really know what to do. I'm pretty terrible at dealing with confrontation so I don't just want to tell him off, but if he keeps it up I don't know what else to do. I'm also scared that if I say anything he might get mad and try something.


ETA: sorry for length, here's the TL;DR - 40-ish y.o. customer tries a couple of times to hit on me(27) in a kind of round-about way, even after being told I'm in a relationship, and makes a habit of coming up behind me in the street to get my attention and then stare at me and I don't know what to do.",TwoXChromosomes,4,1551051500.0,12,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/aue6f4/one_of_the_regular_customers_at_my_work_is/
Scared to be an American,"Texas. All the other states trying to pass similar bills or passing some form of an abortion bill. I feel like it’s unsafe to be an American woman, like our future is doomed. If I didn’t have family here and wasn’t super broke I think I’d run away. I’m so proud of everyone fighting back but I just feel hopeless and frightened right now. Our country is regressing. It’s not safe to walk down the street or go to a bar alone and now our rights over our own bodies are being taken away. Not to mention we already suck at preventing maternal mortality compared to other countries. Women are being failed from every direction.

Feeling empowered after I apprehended a purse snatcher!,"To set the stage: I am quite a tall woman (six feet), but I am also slender and tend to present in a ""girly"" way--glittery makeup, ringlets, lots of floral patterns. Last night this was all amplified as I was dressed up to go out: (low) heels, jewelry, you know. Not a threatening demeanor to say the least. I just don't look like the kind of person who is going to put up a physical fight and I honestly would never expect myself to be that kind of person. I tend to be submissive to the point of it causing problems in my life, in relationships, in the workplace, dealing with creeps. I carry pepper spray but I've always wondered if I'd even have the wits to use it if the situation ever came to be. 

So, be me, at about 10pm last night, on the bus headed home. My reasonably safe neighborhood borders one that is notoriously unsafe, so it was pretty silly of me to leave my purse just sitting next to me on the bus without any physical attachment to my body, but the bus was pretty quiet and I was caught up in my book (I am usually more attentive to this to be honest but I was feeling a little tipsy). As we pull up to a stop, I notice out of the corner of my eye that a man moving in my direction is carrying his body in a way that set me on high alert. It all happened so quickly, but I definitely realized that something bad was about to happen before it did. Anyways, before I can really react to this realization, the guy lunges for my (fancy, designer) purse (that my stepdad gave to me and I will not own anything like again for many years) and starts booking it off the bus. 

Now, I think that if this had happened two or three years ago, I would have been in such a state of shock that the purse snatcher would have been gone before anyone even knew what happened. However, in the past several years, I have really seen the rougher side of city life: my house has been broken into three times and I have had pretty much everything of value that I owned stolen from me, I had an incident where a man walking past me spit in my face, a guy distracted me and stole my phone off an outdoor table at a bar...basically, I have been through the ""shock"" reaction many times in my life. After the shock comes the resistance phase, the anger, and the wanting to rectify what has been done to you, but usually nothing can be done by that point. 

I can only suppose that last night, I slipped straight past the shock phase and into the resistance phase, because I found the words, ""FUCK YOU"" (I hardly ever swear) flying from my mouth as I tore out of my seat and onto the purse abductor. I scrabbled at his sweatshirt, his backpack, but he broke free, hurtled around the corner, and down the stairs. The next few moments were a blur--the next thing I remember is launching myself off the stairs and then all of a sudden I was on top of him on the grass outside of the bus door, desperately trying to force his flailing limbs down and another man was urgently asking what he should grab that belonged to me and somehow his backpack has come off in the midst of all of it.

The nice man had rescued my purse and all of a sudden I was off of him, had propelled myself away and into the crowd that had formed. The would-be purse snatcher frantically scuttled a few feet away before also rectifying himself. His backpack lay at my feet and I punted it at him as hard as I could and then just stood, snarling at him, feeling the rapid breaths blasting through my nostrils and my muscles quiver with the tension. 

""I'm sorry,"" he wailed. ""It wasn't personal, I didn't mean anything by it, I just wanted to get high--I'm sorry."" 

The guy who had grabbed my purse took a step forward. ""Just get out of here man."" The guy scooped up his backpack and took off. At the time I didn't even care or consider calling the cops--I just wanted him away as far away from me as he could. 

The folks on my bus were really supportive. The kind guy gave me back my purse and also a few words of encouragement. When I got to my bus stop, a sweet girl offered to walk me to my house. My whole body was shaking like crazy and all I couldn't say much more than ""yes"" and ""no"" and ""oh, wow, jesus"" for several minutes. The bus driver let me us his phone because mine was dead and I called the cops on the bus and they ended up actually sending a sheriff out to my house to talk to me. 

So, yeah. The cop seems really devoted to helping me out, he called me about 45 minutes after he stopped by to tell me that there might be camera footage available of the incident or at least the guy. 

Looking back on it, it's difficult to believe it even happened! It feels more dreamlike than anything else. It's definitely not the action I would have CHOSEN if I had been thinking about it--I mean, what if that guy had a knife or something? Or even if he had really struggled? Really, once the crowd had gathered (which happened real fast), he gave up the fight, but if the bus had been less crowded or if I had reacted that way on a dark street late at night? Jesus. 

I am glad to have my purse though, and quite frankly, the situation has made me feel more empowered than it has rattled. I will still carry my pepper spray, but I will be able to carry it with the confidence that I can use it. My dad suggested that I should take some self defense courses considering the incident, and while I shied away from that before under the pretense that I wouldn't be able to use it in an appropriate situation, it feels more like something I could realistically use now. 

It may not have been the best decision to fling myself on this potentially dangerous guy, but ultimately I have left this experience feeling like I have glimpsed a fierce, strong side of myself that I didn't really know existed. Hopefully I will not have to use it anytime soon, but it's nice to know that she's in there. 

PS: Decided to post this here because it's something that I wanted to reflect on and this sub seemed relevant--I feel like this guy staked me out because I looked like someone who he could easily victimize due to my gender/appearance (and also potentially because I wasn't paying the fuck attention--which I will be on high alert for in the future).

I just realized recently my sexual assault traumatized me so much my family had been triggering my trauma for a long time.,"Content warning: sexual assault description  


I remember this was the summer I turned 14, I had made a habit of walking every evening at sundown. The weather then was soo nice. It's such a nostalgic time really. The sky was beautiful and the outside just felt, livable and nice. I had to stop taking those walks after what happened.  


That evening, I started walking later than usual. My mom was concerned but I was confident I'd be OK, because I never had felt unsafe. Part of me wants to say I was over confident, but I shouldn't blame myself for feeling I should be safe walking in a gated community, even at dusk.  


So I was walking and the path was louder than usual, a dog was going crazy, some sprinkler was acting up, and there was a guy on the other side of the street riding his bike on the sidewalk going the opposite direction who kept yelling ""Hey, hey you!"" at me. I would acknowledge him, but then he said nothing else. So I'd keep going. I'm half deaf, only one ear working so this sort of sensory overload had me on edge at this point.   


Then the guy, after calling me multiple times crosses with his bike and I thought ""Ughhh, it's probably some dumb jock kid who saw my ugly self and just wants to say some dumb shit then run away. At least after I talk to him, he'll leave and that's one less thing to worry about.""  
The first thing he says is ""Do you want to suck my dick""  
I freeze, felt left thrown into a loop  
""What?"" I said in a panic, he tries to play it off like ""I'd be gentle"" or some other joke like that I walk away really creeped out. guy rides his bike and hits me as he grabs my butt  
He asks me if I'd want to fuck him. I said no with more panic in my voice and try to walk away again. He crashes into me again crashing his bike and squeezing my butt.  
He asks for my age and I tell him thinking in a moment of sort of desperation like - maybe me being not 18 will scare him away, I was very naive. He said he'd seen me walking sometimes. He grabbed my boob, touched my v and then rode off. I was pretty spooked out and disgusted, but eventually managed to keep walking.  


At first I didn't want to tell anyone about it. My older sister's boyfriend at the time was an ex-gang member and he could have gottenn his buddies to go after and potentially kill this guy and I didn't want that on my concuss. He deserved punishment but not that much.  


I told people on a silly blog I ran back then. I didn't know sexual assault was a thing, I didn't know what sexual harassment was really, I asked them if this constituted as sexual harassment and they explained that what I went through was assault. Let me pause here and send a huge, heartfelt shout out to those people. They believed this crazy kid they met over the internet, didn't blame me, gave me advice and comforted me. They encouraged me to call a hotline on this guy though, so that no one got hurt by this guy again. So the next day I did.  


Even though I thought I was over it, it turns out, it's incredibly difficult to report this shit like, I was shaking trying to get my story out, so anyone who went through something like this and didn't report it - I don't blame them. It's tough and scary.   


The hotline recommended I go to a hospital, my mom and I , not seeing why we should, decided against it.  


For years, I thought I was fine but it turned out, I really had been traumatized by the event.  


My parents always were forcing me to get along with my little sister. I was comfortable with myself and knew what I wanted and liked and what I didn't, and my sister was just, always so much trouble and insane and uncomfortable. Even knowing she had autism, she was just sorta, left to kinda do her own thing behavior wise often and it made me uncomfortable but my parents never once cared to talk to me about how it made me feel.  


Soon after the assault, I would have intrusive thoughts of, at first just a hand touching me the way that stranger did. Then later as time went on and my parents kept not listening to my concerns about my little sister and how she made me feel, I imagined it was her hand. She was being forced on me without consent in a similar way to how that guy forced himself on me grabbing me there. It made me have a new type of uncomfortable feeling around her. I genuinely think I can never have a relationship with her because of that. And because I genuinely don't want to be around her personality wise, I don't want to try.  


Even my mom, as she kept forcing her own wants and feelings on me and gave me no space for an opinion. I felt that same uncomfortable feeling around her too. She made me put up with so much bull from both of my sisters. I can only hope therapy can help me, but I absolutely do not want t spend more time around them. I want to cut them off as skin as I can.  


So yeah, thank you for reading, hope you got something out of it.

Still Really Shaken Up,"I was harassed on the street today as I was leaving the supermarket closest to my house. I walk everywhere as, I cannot drive due to being epileptic and I’ve been just fine...

When, as I’m leaving the super market and head to the crosswalk to cross the street, there’s this creep ass old man.
He gives unsolicited advice to ‘watch for cars’. I told him to buzz off in not so many words, he keeps bugging me and then I put my key ring with the ‘defense kitten’ in my hand. He then starts making comments about how ‘I really should be with a man or else I’m unsafe’. I grip the kitten and point it in his direction “No one tells me what to do or how to live my life. Again, leave me alone!”

The light to cross the street is taking forever and he then proceeds to tell me to both “lighten up” and “smile more” yknow...as I’m wearing a face mask.

Light changes, I made quick turn and made sure to walk by the day care where kids are being picked up and there’s both lots of kids and adults. I look back and thankfully wasn’t followed.

I reported him to the police and gave the address of the supermarket and description; I am still very shaken up and feel stupid for not whipping out my phone and or brandishing my pocket knife or pepper spray. I wish I’d even cussed at the guy.

He seemed to think I was much younger than I am (he must’ve assumed teen, I’m in my late 20s) also, I know what I’m wearing shouldn’t matter but I was covered up. Shoulders covered, stomach covered and my shorts are long. 

I’m just over here like: why me? 

I know the most important thing is I got away safely but I cannot focus on anything else but what I didn’t do...",TwoXChromosomes,12,1623101693.0,2,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/nuo9nq/still_really_shaken_up/
Rant: I just want to get groceries without being made to feel uncomfortable.,"I would like to preface this with the fact that I normally DGAF.  I've worked in male-dominated industries a lot so I'm used to the machismo, and have no problem with the occasional catcalling.  It's part of walking down the street, apparently.  Normally, I just ignore them because I can.  I also know how to defend myself, should the situation escalate and get physical.  On to the events that have my skin still crawling several hours later

I was having a great morning today.  I got up, showered, and decided to head out for groceries.  I get to my local grocery store (not the best area, but I'm not usually concerned.  There's usually some homeless person or another outside the entrance, but they just ask for change and leave you be.  Today, there was a group of (older - I'd say mid-40s to 50s) men stand *right* at the entrance to the store.  I try to walk by without getting too much attention, but it's too late.  One guy asks if I need help.  Um, no.   I say no thank you, cause I was raised to be polite.  Then the other 3 start saying all sorts of lewd things.  ""Wanna see my penis."" is the one that sticks in my mind the most.  One of them was just making sexual noises and leering.

I got **SUPER** uncomfortable so I just repeated ""No"" and walked inside.  I never stopped walking, I did not actively engage them in anyway.  I tell the 'security guard' by the front door that the group is harassing people, but don't go into detail.  I think it's over.

I WAS SO WRONG.  I start to relax (it's sunday, it's beautiful, I get to cook today).  I'm just letting it go, and out of nowhere the first guy comes up to me - he hadn't been inside the store when this happened, just hanging around outside.  I can tell he's going to talk to me, so  I try to avoid him.  He follows me, and starts 'apologizing' as I'm trying to walk away.  Finally I just tell him to leave me alone.  He says something about ""I just wanted to make sure you have a good day"".  WUT?!  I just stopped, looked at him and said ""I **WAS** having a good day.  Now leave me alone.""

And that's when the guard decided he was going to start walking over to us.  When I'd already extricated myself from the situation.  Not when he saw a man that I had just told him was harassing people enter the store and start walking toward me.  Not when he saw the guy talking to me.  Once I'd finished the interaction.

I was so upset, I called my boyfriend and left a 2 minute voicemail explaining what had happened.  I tried to finish my shopping as quickly as possible, but any time I was in an aisle alone and someone else turned the corner, I thought it was one of the guys.  Anxiety everywhere.  I'm not normally like this.  I power-shopped, looking over my shoulder the whole time and ended up forgetting a bunch of things I needed because I was so uncomfortable and freaked out.

Sorry for the wall of text, I just needed to get it out.  I've decided this is the last time I go to that grocery store.  There's another one that's only 5 minutes further away.  Thank you for reading.

TL;DR - went grocery shopping, was sexually harassed on my way in the door and made to feel extremely uncomfortable the whole time I was there.  Store security did nothing to make me feel safe.

A woman came to my door asking for the women’s shelter,"Hi all,

This happened like 20 minutes ago. A young woman rang my doorbell and i went to open the door. She told me she was here for the women’s shelter.  I was confused, asked her if she was looking for a specific person and what the address was. She told me the address (not mine), and eventually showed me a google street view pic and I pointed her to a house that was only a couple houses down. A few minutes after I closed the door I sat wondering if I fucked up and should have been more helpful.

She was holding it together but from the get-go seemed visibly/audibly shaken/upset. When I opened the door, it seemed like she really wanted to come in but hesitated when she realized she probably wasn’t in the right place. And when I explained where she needed to go, she didn’t seem too happy to have to go somewhere else. These were all very subtle cues that I didn’t process until a while after i had closed the door so I might be reading into it too much. 

So, I guess my question is, should I have offered her a ride or an escort? Or asked her to come in in case she was being watched? I looked around and didn’t see any people/parked cars, but I’m still left feeling guilty and scared for her.",TwoXChromosomes,20,1605725403.0,3,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/jwlpcz/a_woman_came_to_my_door_asking_for_the_womens/
I'm increasingly afraid of this man and don't know what to do,"I moved into a new neighborhood about a month ago, and every day I walk to classes at my university. It's a friendly place where everyone says hi to everyone else, so when this one guy started coming out of his shop everyday to greet me, I just let it happen. His shop had a glass front that pointed straight down the street that I have to go down to get home, so he always sees me coming. In the beginning, he'd always run out of his shop, say hi and shake my hand. Quirky but whatever. But it's gotten progressively more forward.

One day he asked if he was my friend. Yeah, I said, happy to make my first friend in the neighborhood. The next day he asked if he was my best friend. Assuming he was joking, I laughed and said sure. The next day he greeted me as ""his love"". No, we're just friends, I told him firmly. On future days he started getting increasing pushy about being romantic, so I lied and said I'm married. He didn't believe me, so I showed him a picture of me and a guy friend hugging, claiming my friend in the picture was my husband. He didn't stop. He told me he can't sleep at night, he can't stop thinking about me, I'm so beautiful, he has to marry me. It's getting super pushy. I'm nervous every evening when I walk home from class because I can't avoid walking past his shop, and I can't avoid him yelling after me in the street to come talk more. He keeps trying to get me to come into his building ""to drink coffee"" but there's no way that's happening. I'm also afraid of him following me home. I've already been followed multiple times by different guys since moving in. I was told this is partially because racially I stick out like a sore thumb here and people are curious, whatever that means. I should also mention that this isn't the US, and catcalling here and literally pursuing women is painfully common and normalized. 

At this point, the guy is getting increasingly frustrated and angry at me refusing his advances, but still always meets me every day in the street to talk about it. I'm feeling increasingly unsafe by the situation and don't know what I can say or do to make it stop. I dread walking home and am terrified of being followed.

"Is some ""street harassment"" okay? Is it even harassment?","Controversial title, I know. Not trying to start a flame war. Let me state for the record that I am a woman, a feminist, and a person who has experienced sexual harassment (in the workplace). 

I recently spent several days in blue collar neighborhoods. A lot of hollering, flirtation expressed through yelling across the street at people, and many examples of what could be termed ""street harassment."" Yet, it seemed to me, none of the women had a problem with it, and enjoyed it, responding warmly or with humor. Is what we privileged, educated women on the internet term street harassment actually a viable form of finding a partner in that particular neighborhood/socioeconomic class?

And it occurred to me that, while this media discussion over the past few months about street harassment, and rape culture in general, has been really awesome, and no woman should feel unsafe walking alone, there's an angle to it which strikes me as unsavory. Much of the dialogue is coming from upper class, white-collar women, many of whom are white and college-educated, with access to the internet and media outlets. But what about women who aren't afforded that luxury?

Is there an element of bigotry to our complaints? Are we ignoring the social mores of courtship in blue-collar, lower income neighborhoods? For women who aren't in school, who are full-time moms, who aren't going on dating sites or trying to meet men at a bar, is some guy who hollers at you from across the street a potential romantic partner? Is this how people meet, organically, in the real world? 

Furthermore, how much of our discomfort in being hollered at, as (often) white, privileged women, comes from racism, fear of men of of color, for whom this behavior may be a way of meeting women that generally works for them? There's a fear of attack, or rape, but don't most sexual assaults happen with someone we're already dating, someone we know, not some stranger on the street (a stereotype that it's important to break down)?

Again, I'm not trying to be inflammatory, or make anyone angry, or deny anyone's experience, and for the record I don't like being hollered at by guys in the streets. And obviously it is never okay for a man to pursue/harass a woman after she has clearly let him know she's not interested. BUT I'm trying to examine my perspective, as a white, college-educated woman, and not fall into that second-wave feminist point of view where suddenly the needs of all women are no longer included in feminism. 

I would love to hear some other women's perspectives on this. ",TwoXChromosomes,5,1403286346.0,20,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/28np7q/is_some_street_harassment_okay_is_it_even/

True crime makes me sad,"I apologise in advance for any spelling or grammar errors, I'm very angry and upset and have no energy to proof read.

I absolutely love true crime shows and YouTube videos, paranormal and serial killer alike. But so many of these stories just make me feel miserable, the victims are almost always women or girls, I'm 16f and so feel particularly vulnerable. 
The other day I watched a video with my mum which began with the line ""have you ever felt unsafe when walking down the street?"" Spoken by a man in a sinister tone, the implication being that it was rare and spooky to feel unsafe walking down the street. We both said ""yes"" and laughed but soon turned off the video as it was irritating to hear a man so nonchalantly talk of women being brutalised as though it was a rare occurrence, something he had never had to fear. 

But its every single day for us. I walk to school and am sexually harassed in the 2 minutes between my bus and the school gate, or some entitled man in a car decides hes going to try and hit me as I cross the road because I am taking up too much of his time, or I am shoved aside whilst trying to board a bus. On top of this the man who molested me lives nearby so I can never be sure when walking down the street whether I am safe when I go to the tesco just 100m or so from my house. I cannot go our after dark in case he or any other of the innumerable men who have tried to touch or harass me are there. I'm not allowed a mountain bike because the local trails have been the site of attacks on women. I'm anxious when I go to the shopping mall because more than once I have been followed around. And whats worse is that these incidents have happened the most when I wear my school uniform.

Every day I go out in fear of death and these shows prove that I am right to be nervous, and the male hosts are so goddamn flippant when talking about the death and brutalisation of women. When we all face this every day.  Yet we are constantly gaslit into thinking our fear is irrational. I've had school staff tell me I'm paranoid for thinking I may be attacked as I go home, like it has never happened before. For fearing that my abuser may attack me when I am vulnerable, like he hasn't already done that.

And I live in the UK, in one of the safest cities statistically, in the south west, amongst retirees. But of course the safety statistics only show if you will be stabbed, not if you are surrounded by sex offenders and pedophiles, because they are rarely caught, and if they are its not like the authorities care.

This rant has sidetracked from my og point, and I am not trying to attack true crime or mystery shows. (My personal favourite is lazy masquerade on youtube, the bar is low but he actually acknowledges the dangers faced by marginalised communities and i like that) I just wish women were not constantly being raped and killed.

ISO tips for staying safe as a single female living alone for the first time,"Some context for why I’m asking for tips: I just moved to a new city where I don’t know very many people. I live in an apartment complex that has a front door that has to be unlocked as well as the door to my unit, which only has the deadbolt. I haven’t felt unsafe, but I have noticed people tend to let others through the front door without really checking. I live on the 3rd floor of the complex in an apartment by myself. The walls in the apartments are also fairly well insulated because, while I can hear people in the hall if they are being loud, I can’t hear my neighbors, even though they have a baby that cries sometimes (I’ve heard it in the hallway).

On Thursday I had been listening to a creepy podcast and was a bit jumpy as a result. I went to bed later than usual and had a bit of trouble falling asleep (because of the podcast because I am ridiculous). I finally dozed off when right around 12:15am, I was woken up by someone knocking loudly on my door. I stayed in my bed hoping it wasn’t my door or that it would go away but the knocking continued and even got a bit louder so I put on my bathrobe and trudged over to the door, heart pounding. I looked through the peephole, though of course I wasn’t wearing my glasses since I was disoriented getting out of bed, so I wasn’t entirely sure that I could see properly, but I could tell it was a security guard or police officer. I didn’t think my building had security (they don’t) but I opened the door for the cop who let me know he was just trying to tell me that I left my keys in my door (a very very bad habit that I’ve somehow picked up even after having lived in Chicago for several years). I was relieved and went back to bed, though as soon as I hit the pillow, I started considering whether I should have opened the door. What if the person was just a creepy dude who decided to dress up like a cop to get me to open the door? 

Since this is the first time I’m really living alone, what are some of your tips and tricks for keeping yourself safe? How should I have handled answering the door? Have any of you had success in asking for an additional lock on your door?

How do you tell the difference between creepy behavior and dangerous behavior?,"TLDR; coworker starts following me out to my car, eventually takes picture without permission. Is this just creepy or leaning towards dangerous, and should I get HR involved?

I'm sorry this is so long, but I need to get this out there. Please keep in mind this guy is the same size as Jesse Matthew Jr and I'm closer to Misty Copeland, and the times involved are usually around 9:30pm.

It started innocently enough. There are few women at my job, and a young man I kind of recognized from another area started excitedly saying ""Hi, DistractedMyth!"" every time he saw me (about twice a week or so). My company is pretty equal opportunity, and has a few mentally challenged workers; for some reason, I thought he was one. This means I was more polite than I would usually be, exchanging small talk instead of just a nod while passing by. After a few months of this, he mentions that he's working on a video, and would I be interested in helping him out. Not paying attention, and thinking it's some school thing, I absentmindedly agree and continue on my way. A few weeks go by, and I'm on my way out the door. I pass him by on the path to the parking lot and he asks me again. I responded a little shortly with ""I'm sorry, I'm working two jobs and don't really remember what you're talking about. I'm heading home now, remind me some other time."" He says that's fine and could he get my number; I get a feeling this isn't a school project and tell him I don't give that out and I'll just see him at work. A week or two goes by, and again I'm walking out to my car. (It's a good distance from the security gate, about a quarter mile.) I notice him and pass by, hearing another coworker say to someone ""You're not really doing it, are you?"" I didn't think anything of it . . . Until I realize he's not that far behind me. *That's odd,* I noted. *I thought he took the bus.* No one walks through the parking lot to get to the bus stop unless they're talking to someone else, since it's across and down the street. And there was no one else around, which was not only odd, but unsettling. I sped up a little, clambered into my vehicle and took off, only to see him veering away from the path I was on and head to the bus stop.

At this point I'm a little weirded out, but brush it off. A week later, once again I'm heading out through the parking lot, and he approaches me with the same question. I give him the same answer. At this point I'm logically aware that I should just say no, but I'm exhausted and just want to go home. I do make it clear that I'm super busy and I'm probably not going to be able to help, but we'll see. He accepts this with a confused look, and walks toward the bus stop while I walk to my car. *For all I know, he just parks on the end near the bus stop. Even though everyone else who does that goes through the other security gate. I'm just being paranoid.* At least, that's what I tell myself.

And now we're to last night, which is about a week or two after that last time. I'm walking out and realize he's in front of me. He moves with all of the speed of an giant tortoise, so I pick up my pace and pass him. I make it to the parking lot, walking faster than a slow jog, and realize he's still behind me. And no one else is around. He calls my name, but I ignore it. He calls again just as I get to my vehicle, and even though I don't feel very comfortable, I turn around. (Note: most of my shift gets out around the same time, so I knew someone would be around in about 30 seconds.) He holds his phone while he asks me about the video, and this time I tell him the truth: I work 65 hours a week at two jobs, and I'm sorry, I don't think I'm going to be able to help him. He responds with ""Oh, okay. Where else do you work?"" And I mention the industry, just wanting to get away. Then there's a flash from his phone. The asshole is taking a picture of me, at night, in my work parking lot, without my permission, while standing five feet away from me. I freak out. ""What are you doing?! That is not okay! That is not acceptable!"" He laughs while I jump into my car and get the fuck out of there. (I have no idea if he took a picture of my face or my tank top and mid length running shorts. Either way, I'm covered in dirt and sweat and squinting and looking away from the camera.)

And now I have no idea what to do. I feel vaguely violated and definitely unsafe. He hasn't shown any other aggressive tendencies, though. Yeah, I could walk with others through the lot, and I often do. I have mace, but it's considered a weapon and I'm not allowed to take it into work. I rarely see him inside the building, since he works in a different area, so that's not really an issue. He knows what I drive and switching vehicles isn't an option.

Someone tried to grab me while I was walking alone,"This happened a few nights ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I'm wondering whether I am overreacting to the situation or perhaps I've been naive my whole life to this issue.

I was heading home from school late at night (night class) and it was already dark. I have to take two busses to my destination and I transfer downtown. I got off the bus downtown and was running a little bit later than usual so I had to hurry to the next bus stop. I was walking down a side street that was fairly well lit and where other people were walking. I saw a man walking towards me and noticed he was wearing a shirt with the logo of the school I attend. He was tall and looked older than most college students but looked relatively normal. I didn't think anything of it and I looked down and kept walking. He approached me on the right side of the sidewalk, I was on the left. As he walked past me, he reached out and tried to grab me - my arm, I believe. I jumped away, onto the road, and started to run away. I turned around to look at him and he was looking at me. Just looking and walking away.

What happened? What did he want and why did he do that? If he had gotten ahold of me, I'm sure he wouldn't've been able to take me anywhere without someone noticing. I wasn't carrying a purse or holding my phone.

I keep trying to tell myself that he probably just wanted to talk. But he didn't say a word.

I'm just confused. I've never felt unsafe walking by myself before but now I'm honestly scared. Has this happened to anyone else?",TwoXChromosomes,3,1551981091.0,8,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/ayfg6p/someone_tried_to_grab_me_while_i_was_walking_alone/
Can’t even walk to my own mailbox,"Just yelling into the void a bit with this story....TL;DR: getting yelled at by men sucks and no matter where you are it will probably happen. 

After almost a decade of living in the city I moved to the country. My house is on a truck route that has minimal traffic and the speed limit is 45mph. Last week I decided to wear a long skirt and a tshirt. I also wear a sun hat when I’m outside. The only skin showing was my arms. 

I walked to the mailbox to get the mail. Seems reasonable eh? I could see a motorcyclist coming up the road as I reached the mailbox and as I turned to head back toward the house I heard him slow down and yell “HEY HONEY” as he drove off. 

I stopped in my tracks. I’ve never felt unsafe at my house here. I’ve never been hollered at in my yard or otherwise on my property. I wasn’t dressed provocatively and I wasn’t doing anything but walk. But this man with two words took me right back to city life. “SERIOUSLY?” I yelled at his direction though he was long gone. “What the FUCK”

When I lived in the city I waked to everything. My work was just three blocks from my house but a busy bus stop was on my way. I could avoid the bus stop but then my walk would take double the time so I rarely did it. One day I was headed to work in short shorts and a tank top. It was the thick of the summer in the American south with the kind of heat and humidity that stuck to your skin all day. Due to my profession (fitness) this was an absolutely appropriate outfit for what I was about to go do. My shirt had the branding of my company. I walked past the bus stop to hear “damm ma bring that fine ass this way” I ignored the call and kept walking. As I reached the end of the block I heard the same voice yell “damn bitch you don’t gotta be so MEAN.”

Mean. He said I was mean for ignoring his rude demands. I snapped and turned to scream “I am NOT mean! You assholes MADE me this way!” With tears streaming down my face I finally made it to work. That’s when I knew I had to get out of the city. 

I thought it would be better out here in the country. But it’s the same shit on a different street. I don’t want to live secluded as a hermit but I don’t want to be sexualized for EXISTING either. 

I know it is a stark comparison from the city event to the most recent one but the feelings it spurred inside me are the same. I want to be seen as a PERSON not a sex object. I don’t think there is anywhere in the world I can go where that will happen.",TwoXChromosomes,7,1591207584.0,4,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/gvz0su/cant_even_walk_to_my_own_mailbox/
2 years since I was mugged at gunpoint outside my apartment...,"I was living in Echo Park in East Los Angeles, CA at the time and I believe it was somewhere between 10:30pm and 11pm.  I had finished my restaurant shift earlier in the evening and then gone to the gym and stayed for a long time. I was in a daze that day because I knew my grandmother was probably going to pass on. She was old and dealing with a variety of health issues and my mom texted me that morning saying that she probably wouldn’t make it through the day. She ended up passing around the time I finished my restaurant shift, which is why I made sure to go to the gym. She was in Florida so I couldn’t be there. I wanted to physically move through the grief I was feeling. I wanted to zone out in the sauna.

When I finally got home, I had to first look for a parking spot because the garage spots that came with my apartment unit were used by one of my roommates and my boyfriend at the time. My boyfriend and I agreed that he could use the parking spot because his car was older and easier to break into and had in fact been broken into on our street already. So I drove around for a bit looking for a spot. I finally found one about a block away. Not too far. Echo Park used to be known as a “sketchy” neighborhood, but in the last 5 years it had been heavily gentrified (which ironically had now made it a target).  It was dark but the street was lined with homes and other apartment buildings and there were usually people walking their dogs so I never felt totally unsafe. It was definitely residential and was also very close to Sunset Blvd which is heavily lit and usually active with night time activity.   

I started walking towards my building, which was around the corner from where I parked. As I was walking, I saw two young guys get dropped off at the corner ahead of me. And I saw them begin to walk down my street. It looked like an Uber/Lyft type drop off. I was maybe 30/40ft behind them. They were walking very close to each other so I thought maybe they were a couple headed down to sunset for a night out. Then I saw them turn down the driveway of my apartment complex. I immediately thought, “Oh man they’re my neighbors! How awkward that I don’t know them... sheesh I’m so antisocial.” I then noticed that they were leaning next to the gate that I needed to walk through to get to the stairs that lead up to my front door (I was in the first apartment/duplex).  Cue overly polite inner monologue where I was curiously preoccupied with the comfort of these strangers, “Oooh looks like they’re having an intimate moment/private conversation... awkwarddd I’m going to disrupt them while I walk right past them.”* So I prepared myself to walk swiftly past them as to not disturb them. The moment I turned towards them, one of them immediately walked towards me and said, “Give me your bag.” And I could not have been more shocked and taken by surprise. I actually said out loud, “Are you kidding?” 

And then I saw that both of these guys were holding guns. 

I also somehow registered in that moment that they were young and scared. I could see the fear in his eyes... the one who spoke to me. And I felt sad for him.  What happened next, I think happened because of my mom and how she used her life experiences to prepare my sisters and I for scary dangerous moments like this one. Unfortunately, my mom has been attacked more that once in her life. I think all of these unfortunate experiences happened in her 20’s. I’m grateful that she chose to share her experiences with my sisters and I. I don’t remember why or how or when she began sharing her experiences with us... but for as long as I can remember, she has been reminding us of these stories and they have always stayed with me.   

In one of these stories, she was followed home by a belligerent drunk man. She tried to get inside her building before he could get to her and unfortunately she was unable to. She then tried to calmly reason with him as he blocked her from closing the front door to her lobby behind her. He shoved her back so hard that she fell to the ground and he came down on top of her. No one was around and it was late at night. She immediately started kicking and fighting and trying to get him off of her.  His weight kept her from being able to get a deep enough breath to yell for help. And she told me that somehow she had the clarity to tell herself that the moment she could get a deep breath, she would scream as loud as she could. As she tried to fight him off, they rolled over.  She was finally able to get that breath and it worked. He ran away. The sad truth is that no one ever came. But at least it scared him off and she wasn’t hurt more seriously.  

In my moment with these two guys and their guns, I remembered this. It’s funny how many thoughts we can have in a split second, let alone 3-5 seconds. I remembered this story while I looked up at my apartment windows. They were lit up. My roommates were right there in that living room, watching TV, the way they always were this time of night. I saw the lights on in my bedroom and I knew my boyfriend was in there. They were so close. So, I took the deepest breath I could and screamed my boyfriend’s name as loud as I could. I was so relieved to hear the strong sound that came out because, ironically, I’ve had many dreams where I needed to scream or run and found myself unable to produce sound and my limbs too heavy to lift, as though I was running through mud.* As I looked up and screamed, the guy who had spoken to me grabbed the only thing he could, the gym bag I had hanging in the crook of my arm, and they both ran away. Luckily I was wearing a backpack at the time and either they didn’t notice it because my long hair was covering the straps or they just didn’t have time to grab it. So all they got was my gym bag... and the little part of me that had never been mugged. They got that too.   

Even with headphones on, my boyfriend somehow heard me scream from our upstairs bedroom. I couldn’t believe how fast he got downstairs and outside to me, telling our roommate to call 911 on his way. Then some of my neighbors started coming outside. They’d heard me scream too. The police came and I filed a report. Another lucky circumstance was that I’d recently purchased renters insurance and since I was robbed on my property I got reimbursed for everything from the gym bag to all the gear I had inside. I’m really only sharing that in case some of you need a push towards getting renters insurance. If you have shit worth protecting, I say protect it. My gym gear wasn’t really worth protecting. But getting reimbursed monetarily for what was taken from me felt like a power move. A small bit of retribution getting back what was taken from me. It was a small comfort.   

Anywho, the only reason I’m sharing this story is because most people who’ve heard it are amazed that I was “brave” enough to scream. And that scares me more than anything. I was always taught to kick and scream and fight back no matter what. Even if an attacker has a weapon. I’d rather the potential risk of getting cut or stabbed or shot in the arm than the uncertainty that comes with being abducted or otherwise. If someone is dangerous, I don’t want to be alone with them. I’m not suggesting anyone toy with their lives. But I am suggesting fighting back when you can.  

I hope my story, and my mom’s story, are of some value to anyone reading this who wants to feel inspired. Even if you just relate because something similar has happened to you. I think, if we’re comfortable, it’s important to share what we’ve been through as openly as possible.

Need a kick in the ass to leave a bad relationship,"I know I need to end my relationship.  We have been together since we were in college, and I am in love with him, but it gets worse every day. My fiancé yells at me an stonewalls me every single day.  He has locked me out of the house without a wallet.  He has left me on the street in an unsafe neighborhood in the middle of the night.  Literally everything I say is an opportunity for him to scream at me, and then he tells me that I am provoking him because I ""love drama.""  If I mention the wedding he goes completely ballistic about how badly I am stressing him out.  He pouts and punishes me for anything good that happens to me because it makes him feel inferior.  I am afraid to tell him good news because I know it will make him unhappy.  He will refuse to talk to me if I do anything without him at all, but goes out to bars constantly.

I am getting nothing out of this relationship.   He ignores me when I initiate sex.  He is sometimes there for me emotionally but mainly it is borderline emotional abuse.  I don't like who I've become in this relationship.

Why do men feel the need to ask me for my number through their car window?? Its creepy AF!!!,"I dont understand what goes through their head for them to think this is acceptable. They dont know anything about me. They dont even know how old I am. They dont know if Im seeing someone. They dont even know if Im into hetero-relationships. 

It baffles me. It happened again the other day, a group of guys that looked to be in their late teens drove up beside me. I regularly walk the route I was on with a large golden retriever (a healthy 95lbs- hes HUGE and such a love bug). At the point we were there were no houses, just the end, unmaintained street leading to the highway, storm pond, and field. And they drove up and asked for my number from the car. I was thoroughly freaked out. I just said 'no' and continued without looking at them. Then they TURNED THEIR CAR AROUND AND DROVE UP TO ME AGAIN. At this point Im grabbing my phone to be prepared to call someone, and they ask if I had seen a phone on the ground (they were driving, did they throw it out the window??) to which I replied no and immediately cut off into the field as its in view of houses again an frequently used as an unofficial off leash park (theres a large hill, though, so I had to climb over the hill to be seen by the houses/people). 

Im just sick and tired of it. This is the first time Ive ever felt unsafe in my own neighbourhood and it's wholly unacceptable to feel that. Like, I was walking a dog, minding my business, sweaty af. Did I have a sign on my back saying Im looking to get picked up? Im just...pissed. So, so pissed off. At myself for being scared even though I had a right to be. Pissed at them for thinking it was an acceptable advance. Pissed at my neighbourhood design for having 200m of dangerous road for people to travel.

It blows my mind how terrible people can be.,"I live in the Phoenix area,I just moved here from Chicago about a year ago. I was driving to the dollar store that's down the street from my house and as I was turning to pull in I see this old man fall down by the bus stop and just lay there on the ground. He was definitely homeless,very dirty,old clothes,holes in his shoes etc. Anyways in my mind he had a heart attack or something was medically wrong with him. It was pretty busy out at the time,people walking and driving past so I'm thinking by the time I pull in and park someone would have been helping him already. That was not the case at all. It was so disappointing and disgusting watching people literally walk over this man. I'm not even kidding they walked over him! I run over as I'm calling 911 I bend down to talk to him and see if hes ok. Soooo it turns out he was just super wasted:/ his name was Joe and once i started talking to him I could smell the liquor on his breath. I went and bought him a bottle of water and waited with him until the ambulance arrived. Even tho he was just drunk It was still upsetting that no one stopped.

Feeling Unsafe in my Own House.,"I’m not sure if this is the write place to post this... but I need to talk to someone. 
I’m sorry the formatting sucks. I’m on mobile. 

My house was broken into over the weekend, they kicked the door in, and went through my entire bedroom. I walked in on the middle of the robbery, I looked and saw the door frame on the ground and I immediately closed the door and ran across the street to call 911. Something like this has never happened to me before. 
I’m a young woman, apparently women’s rooms are targeted more often because the likelihood of there being more valuables. 
The robbers were still in the house apparently when I walked in, they tried forcing their way out the front of the house (I came in from the back). It took the police over an hour and a half to get to my house, even when I told them I thought the intruders were still inside. 
I haven’t been able to get this out of my head, I think about it all the time. When I walk in my back door im terrified I’m going to see the door frame on the ground again. I’m scared to be in my house alone, and I can’t handle being in the house at night. (This happened at night) 
I’m a rather petite woman, I don’t feel that I’d be able to properly defend myself against a man let alone two. I’m terrified what would have happened if they had broken into my house while I was home, and what would have happened to me. 
I do not feel safe in my own home, I feel like they are going to come back and rob the house again. 
I feel nauseous, I don’t want to eat, my heart races when i think of coming to my house. 
The guy I’m seeing doesn’t understand, he tells me I need to get over it and stop thinking about this. That it’s not likely that they would come back to the same house. He feels that I need to take up arms and defend myself, and if I were to hide if this happened again he would be angry with me.  
I know I shouldn’t be thinking these things, but I am. I can’t stop, I’m so terrified and the one person I want to go to for comfort doesn’t understand and feels that I should be acting in this way. He admits that I’m traumatized, yet expects me to act like nothing happened.
I feel so vulnerable, I don’t feel safe, it feels like I have nowhere to go.

I (f23) just got harrassed at the bus stop and I felt very unsafe and didn't know what to do,"I just got off work, it's 1 am. And I went to wait for the bus. It's downtown, not the best area. I wouldn't really describe any area of my city as dangerous but where I was is near some bars. But it's a well lit area with usually lots of people. So I didn't feel worried, like usual. 

I had to wait for like 30 mins and I was thirsty. There's a fast food restaurant right there so I got a drink and I was coming out this guy held the door open for me. He started talking in French, which I barely speak. It sounded like he was asking if I was ok so I stopped and was like what, sorry I don't speak French. He barely speaks English.

He starts talking to me and I don't really know what to do cause I'm trapped at the bus stop for like 15 more minutes. He's basically telling me he's in love with me and he's interested in me. I tell him I'm married (I'm not but I wear a promise ring on that finger) and he's telling me about how that doesn't guarantee anything. Honestly what he's saying is not even that bad (I hate saying that) but it was just the feeling of being trapped there. He makes me take down his number into my phone (I didn't realize that he could see mine and now I think he might know my number) and I go along cause I honestly didn't know what to do. 

Finally my bus comes in the distance and he wants to hug me goodbye. I kind of let him do ot cause I had like two big bags in my hands and a drink and a phone and I figure wed like not even touch. Which was true until he tries to go for a kiss and I move and he ends up lightly kissing me on the neck. So angry. 

And the worst part was when I got on the bus I realized on the other side of rhe shelter was my (male) friend from work who is a giant and if I had seen him would have run over to. Which makes me angry that I have to even go to a guy to save me.

Basically now I just feel super violated. And I'm scared of going to the bus stop again. In the day it's fine because the bus runs to a different stop until 11 pm. But after that I have to go to this stop (he says he lives right there and is always oUT on the street). And he might have my number. I got a voice mail where nothing was said but I can't see the number. I set his number to ""add to autorejct list"" but don't know if I can block him somehow.

A cop made me (8 months pregnant) feel unsafe,"Hi, this is my first time posting and I’m somewhat new to reddit. This happened on November 2018, at the beginning of the month. I was 21 years old and 8 months pregnant at the time. This happened in Weston Fl (for context) a pretty safe city with almost no crime. I was coming home from school around 8pm, when my mom asked me to stop by Publix, as I was leaving I noticed a  police car parked outside. I got on my car and drove, when I noticed the cop car war right behind me. I’m usually really paranoid about tickets so I get really nervous when I pass a police officer, even if I’m driving following all of the rules I still feel like I’m being watched and anxious. Then suddenly he speeds and cuts me off, at this point I notice he speeds off and then slows down almost as he was trying to bother me. We got to the next stop light (he was in front of me) and I had to keep going straight but the cop car had his right turn light on, so he turned right, but when he noticed I kept going straight he made a U-turn and kept following me. Now before he did this I understood we were probably going on the same direction but after this my alarms went off and I started wondering why he would do such thing. Whatever, I brushed it off as him turning on the wrong street. Now, I live in a gated community, that asks for id and calls your house to let someone in, but police is always allowed no questions asked for obvious reasons. So we are already in the community and he’s still behind me, I keep going thinking he may actually live there, but every turn I make he does too. I actually pass my house but I’m too scared to stop thinking he might do something when I get off my car, probably not, but at this point I’m basically about to pop so I don't want to do anything that will disturb my baby. Then I started going around other streets, cop car still behind me, turning right and left sometimes not using my turn signals to see if he would keep going, but when I did a sharp turn he would too. That’s when I decide enough is enough and I go to my house. I get of my car and get inside my house where I tell my mom what happened. She looks outside the window and the car’s still parked out there, and he stayed for at least 20 minutes. We didn’t know what to do so we just called the non-emergency police line and they said our license plate may have had something wrong (almost not possible since my car was a lease and my dad was EXTREMELY picky about having everything up to date) or that the police officer followed me to make sure I got home ok (In one of the safest cities of the U.S?). Why would the police officer do this? Any other experiences like this one? Also I want to point out that I drive like and old lady, very cautious, and I’m pretty sure I didn’t give him any reasons to pull me over.

Are men more bold in the northern states of America?,"I moved to Pennsylvania from Texas a couple months ago and I’ve noticed that men here are frankly... more annoying. IDK if it’s just cause most Texas cities are not walkable so you’re less likely to be walking anywhere really, but ever since I moved here men who I’ve never met in my life try and engage in conversation with me and I hate it. For the most part it’s not like, full blown street harassment, but I just really have no interest in speaking to a man unless it’s for work. 

There is one thing that’s been happening that’s been bothering me a lot and I could use some advice on. There’s been construction on my street, it’s further down the street from my house, like you can’t even see it unless your walking further down. But every single morning one of the construction guys is like, waiting at the end of my walkway to try and have a conversation with me, asking me where I work and shit. It makes me so nervous cause there’s no reason for him to be there, like whatsoever, sir why aren’t you at your job you’re on the clock. Lately I’ve been ignoring him but I just hate that this is happening and taking up space in my thoughts. Maybe this is corny but even though he’s not directly threatening me it makes me feel unsafe that he knows where I live and essentially my work schedule.",TwoXChromosomes,0,1571600750.0,5,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/dkopn5/are_men_more_bold_in_the_northern_states_of/
I feel oddly unsafe thanks to my Uber driver,"I hope this kind of post is okay. This feeling was so weird and unexpected and somehow a first for me as a thirty-year-old.

I’m currently on vacation with my (also female) friend and just had an Uber driver drop us off to our Airbnb. It was midnight and he was friendly and joking when we first entered, which is common of this city. In fact we were talking right before we got picked up about how many great conversations we’ve had with our Uber drivers this trip.

But conversation with this guy felt like it got weird fast. He went from normal jokes to dragging the joke on too long (joke being that we didn’t bring him food from the place we’d just been at), then saying he was only joking, and are we mad at him. I said no, so he asked if “that one” (my friend) was mad at him. Then he asked which one is [my name] and what my friend’s name is. He seemed very adamant on knowing which one was which.

He asked if we were visiting or if we live here, if we knew which house we were going to, and when we got into the neighborhood of our house, commented on what a nice neighborhood it was. He just seemed to be pressing us with tons and tons of questions despite us starting to get cagey. He also made a remark about how a young woman walking alone on the street was very skinny, which I thought was odd.

When he dropped us off our our house, he seemed to take a really good look at it and it doesn’t help that this house has huge windows with no curtains or blinds. He waited for us to go in before leaving, which isn’t uncommon, but of course felt strange after all the invasive questions in the car.

They could be considered run of the mill questions, but we’ve had tons of drivers ask us similar things this trip, but none of them gave us the creepy feeling that this man did. 

I know it may sound paranoid, but I just got such a bad feeling from him. It felt like he was trying to get as much info from us as possible. In my home city, I live in a large apartment building where drivers couldn’t possibly know where exactly I live, so I’m totally unfamiliar with having a stranger know where I am and how foreign I am to the area. I’m not even sure how to feel or protect myself. I feel exposed and vulnerable, and at the same time, a bit ashamed and silly for being this scared.

Has anyone else ever had this feeling before? And if so, how did you make it through the night? Because it definitely feels like I’m not going to sleep tonight.",TwoXChromosomes,2,1556861535.0,6,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/bk4v04/i_feel_oddly_unsafe_thanks_to_my_uber_driver/
Why I choose not to report (story time),"Cw; rape

A few weeks ago by now, I got home from a particularly bad traffic jam that double my commute. I was hungry and tired. I live in a small apartment above a building company, so their end of week celebration only had men. It's a small company, so I didn't question the fact there seem to be no woman around. The weather was good so they had a barbeque. My hungry self got offered some sate, all in good faith.

Next stop, a drink. More food and drinks follow as I enganged in pleasant conversation. I had no idea there was a predator there, I had no reasons to be suspicious, except for the fact they were men.

I'm not the kind of person to live in fear or judge a group by their worst. The landlord owns the company so it didn't seem unsafe. I've lived there for over a year and never had reason to believe I was unsafe.

Well, now I do.

I don't really remember much, except that I was sitting outside in good company. I never black out on drinks and I know my limits well. This is why I believe the man slipped something in my drink.

There are at best flashes of memories that I can't be sure are real or not. I got woozy so a pair took me up to my room and put me to bed. The way that I expect any decent man would.

When my mind came back, well I am not getting into the details. Nobody wants those. 
I was far too shocked by the situation I was in to respond in a logical way. I didn't cooperate, but I didn't say no or fight back. I was confused and I was scared.

When he passed out after in my bed I pretty much fled my home, walking the streets on bare feet while listening to music. It didn't occur to me that I could use my phone to call the police. I did hope to run into them, but I didn't. 

It took me 5 days to pluck up the courage to call the national help line. I was told to come to the emergency room. There was testing, information and well, support. I felt a little more safe and comfortable, though still very ill at ease. 

My boyfriend, bless his heart, has been supportive through the entire thing. He flew over to be with me and has continued to support me through this, as have many friends that I dared to tell.

Most friends, two exceptions, encouraged me to report. To call the cops even though I made it clear that I didn't want to. 

The two that did not? They are a wonderful couple and one of the two went through something similar. She choose to report and the cops told her they did not have enough evidence to pursue the case. I was there with her back when she reported and I remember that conversation. It wasn't very pretty. 

Still, earlier this week I faced my fears of victim blame and called the police, special victims unit. 

In the space of one conversation they:
1) ignored my request for an informative conversation and treated it like a report, over the phone
2) told me that if I could not manage to tell details I might as well have consented and changed my mind (but framed it as devils advocate)
3) told me I should have called sooner so they could have tested for drugs (like, I know that already. If I could have, I would have)
4) told me to get therapy and try again later

Well, no thank you. 

What they failed to do:
1) acknowledge the courage to try and report
2) acknowledge the trauma of going through such an experience
3) treat me like a human being rather than a nuisance.

I was physically sick after this phone call and had to go home sick from work because of it. The police did more victim blaming in a single call than all others I told combined. I did not feel heard or safe. I felt like the officer in question invalidated my experience because I'm still too traumatised to give details.

The few I told how it went were outraged, even if they pushed me to report before. They are angry with and for me. For how I was treated by those that should have helped. 

I don't report because it's traumatising to relieve such an experience without any compassion. 
I don't report because I can't collect evidence to prove my claim. 
I don't report because quite honestly? I no longer trust the police with my case.

I don't tell a lot of people because I fear they'll put the blame on me. 
Should I have distrusted these people by default? I believe not. The perp knew what he was doing. He waited until the others had gone home until he snuck up. He clearly didn't want people to know. 

(Reconstruction from short convo I had with one of the guys I talked with about that night, more to ask what happened to his knowledge. I was brought upstairs, nothing more or less)

He knew the door had to be locked manually. 
He knew to put me in the shower to wash off the evidence.
At best he took advantage of me, but the evidence suggests otherwise.

I was too drunk or drugged to concent, but the police ignored that completely.

I won't report, but it's not the end. I'm saving up money and I plan to reschool myself. Phychology degree is the current plan. I want to help people like myself. My friends think I can do it. I want to tell people what I wish I could tell myself.

It's not my fault.
There is nothing I could or should have done differently.
I am not what happened and it does not define me.

I'm trying to find a new place to live. I still feel a sense of fear every time I hear activity at the company. I get angry when I see his face when I get to work or come home. I want to punch him in the face. I want to steal his wallet and see if he really carries that stuff to work with him. To knwo that I'm not crazy even when it feels that way.

I have a friend over but she had to go home for the weekend. I had to work late and only have one house key. I had to check all the rooms to see they were empty before I could relax and lock the door behind me. 

Everything is not okay. But it will be. 
Maybe I'll never have justice, but I'll make my own by helping others. I won't let this make me into a person of bitter anger. I want to do good.

And I will.

But first I need to repair the damage I sustained.

Looking for advice,"So today I had an extremely uncomfortable experience and I'm wondering how (or if) I should react to it. 

Some background: I am a young post college female living in a predominantly low income black neighborhood with 3 housemates who I am not at all close with. Every single time I walk to the gym (regardless of my outfit) I get comments from neighbors like, ""Hey beautiful,"" ""What's your name?"" Despite this, I have generally felt safe in my neighborhood.

Today, I was unloading groceries from my car when I dropped a bag and a bottle of champagne shattered. I bent over, ass towards the street, to gather up the shards and 2 men (both black, maybe in their 30s) started talking at me. They said, ""Whatchoo got there girl? You got some water? You got some cheesecake? Do you have cheesecake in there?"" I did not reply and just continued picking up the shards. This made them angry. The men said, ""Excuse me! We're talking to you! That's just prejudiced! That's messed up! You're prejudiced! We're neighbors! We don't want you here! You need to get out of this neighborhood!"" I went around to the back of my house to throw away the glass and the men finally left.

This little event definitely shook me up a bit. While I don't appreciate it, I've gotten used to the standard cat calling, but this was above and beyond. I don't believe that these men will really do anything to me, but I still feel unsafe. I don't know if there's anything I can really do about this situation. Maybe I will only drive to the gym from now on or only take walks when my boyfriend can accompany me. These options are certainly less than empowering. My lease is up June 1st and I won't be staying, but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to handle this until then.

A friend was harassed on the street the other night and it's left a bad taste in my mouth,"I wouldn't normally take to reddit to vent my frustrations, but this incident is leaving me feeling incredibly out of sorts. 

In the very early hours of Monday morning, a close friend of mine and I were walking from a club venue (located on a small side street) to a major road in order to hail a taxi. There had been a huge concert going on in my city in the evening directly before this, and the streets that would normally be fairly quiet were quite busy. 

The district we were in houses quite a lot of club venues, and all of them seemed to have drawn in a crowd for various after-parties that had come about after the concert.

As my friend and I walked by the front of another nearby club, a man that had been standing out front with a large group reached out and grabbed her wrist. He gives her the typical ""hey baby, where are you going in such a hurry? Come party with us"" line.

Almost immediately, I shout at him to let her go. My memory of this is a little hazy, but I do remember also grabbing her wrist in order to move his hand. He doesn't let her go, but tells me to shut my mouth because ""he just wants to talk to my pretty friend.""

At this point, the rest of the group have surrounded us and are shouting encouragements for the man that had grabbed my friend. ""He's just trying to help us pick up."" ""You guys are hot, we had to stop you."" etc, etc.

Through the entire exchange, I continue yelling for him to let go of her. A police cruiser is parked down the street, and I'm told by the man and his friends to ""shut up, in case the cops come to check us out.""

I'm not entirely sure what I said after that point, but finally one of the guys relents and says ""just let her go man, her friend is losing it. It's not worth it.""

As we start to walk away, my friend turns to me and says ""you shouldn't have said anything. I was going to handle it by myself. You could have gotten us into a really bad situation there."" Up until this point, she hadn't said a word to the guys harassing her. 

Am I wrong to have said something? Should I have kept my mouth shut? I'm very much the type to talk back as soon as someone catcalls me, and I almost always get a response in which they back off. I've never been in a situation where someone has actually used force to get my/someone else's attention. 

I don't see any situation where staying quiet and keeping my head down has a positive outcome. I've never felt unsafe in my city, and this scenario played out one of my worst fears. It's left me feeling uneasy, especially because her reaction the whole thing was ""you shouldn't have talked back at them"" and incredibly nonchalant.

To all you outdoor exercisers: has anyone ever made you feel uncomfortable or unsafe during your regular work out?,"I live in Portland, OR and have the fortune of being able to run through a beautiful park as part of my normal running route.  As I was heading up to the park (not even 3 minutes into my run), I saw a young man on a bike hop off the sidewalk to my right, cross the street, and turn up the street I was on.


He continued to ride lazily just behind me (he could have easily ridden past me if he'd been going at a normal pace).  This in itself isn't totally weird (and I'm aware I don't wear a lot of clothes when I run so getting checked out happens) but the fact that it continued for about 3 blocks and he seemed to slow down or stop with me when I hit a stop sign made me uncomfortable.


There's a street with cross traffic right before the park.  (note: it was around 9:30 am so no dark, treacherous areas to worry about, and lots of people around) I was able to cross quickly before the cars came and blocked him from following.  He looked like he was checking his phone and couldn't have quickly darted after me.  I got into the park and stood behind a bush so I could see him come in but he couldn't see me.  A few minutes later, sure enough, he rode in.  I ducked under the bush and he passed without seeing me.


Luckily, a woman was jogging past so I asked her if I could jog with  her and explained why.  She was incredibly understanding and assured me it's better to be paranoid than sorry.


I know this situation could easily be an overreaction and I'm so glad it wasn't anything worse/more weird.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had any similar experiences.  Whether you wish you had been more alert/let yourself listen to your gut or maybe you feel like you've been made uncomfortable  but don't feel like it was worthy of expressing.


Stay safe out there, ladies, and to the woman I met today, thank you for making me feel accepted and safe.  I can only wish the same on anyone else who feels the way I did this morning.

One of the scariest moments of my life just happened.,"Okay, so this happened about an hour ago. I am still trying to process everything. This may just be a jumble of words but I am hoping that writing everything out will help. I am okay physically. Nothing actually happened. But it could have. It's the ""could have"" that is bothering me right now.

I am fairly average sized for a girl, about 5'3, not thin but not overweight. I decided to go for a quick jog, at dusk. The sun was down but it was still fairly bright outside. 

The street that I live on is pretty busy. About 6 or 7 neighborhoods, a grocery store, a convenience store, lots of bus stops. It is pretty common for someone to be walking up or down the street, pretty much at any time. My mother-in-law works at the grocery store at the end of the street, it's about half a mile from my apartment complex. I have gone jogging up and down this road many times. 

My town is pretty safe. It isn't a big city. It's a tourist town (part of US history) so it can get pretty crowded in the summer but for the most part, has a small town vibe. I have been a pizza delivery driver for over 2 years here and have only felt unsafe a few times. Even in the ""bad parts of town."" 

So, I was jogging along, towards the next neighborhood after mine. After that neighborhood, there is another that has a loop. I was just going to make the loop and jog back. I'd be gone for 20 minutes, max. And less than a quarter of a mile from my own neighborhood. There was a guy walking pretty far ahead of me, who turned into the neighborhood I was running towards. This is all pretty common stuff. I didn't think anything of it. Until I got closer to the neighborhood. I spotted this guy, crouched down behind a fence, behind some bushes, about 15-20 feet away from the sidewalk, where I was. I immediately noped the fuck out of there. Turned around and booked it as fast as I could back to the neighborhood. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and took my ear buds out of my ears (so I could hear if he was chasing me) and literally ran as fast as I could until I got back to my neighborhood. I looked back and it seemed like he was casually strolling along, walking in my direction. 

I ran upstairs and got my husband who darted outside to look for this guy. I was out of breath. I am not in shape. This was my first run in over a year. 

The guy, of course, was nowhere to be found. He probably assumed I was going to call the cops (which I should have but I was running so fast I doubt I could have spoken) and disappeared. I was so scared that this dude was going to chase me. For like 30 seconds, I was terrified for my life.

There's no way that guy wasn't up to something. At best, he was going to come up behind me to steal my phone and iPod and at worst...well...I don't want to think about that. I am going to get some pepper spray tomorrow and I will not be running anywhere near night time. 

I don't know what to do with myself right now. I hate that I can't run whenever I want to and not fear for my life. I hate that I feel like I can't even go out by myself. I hate that I couldn't run any faster. I hate that I am going to be scared of every guy walking down the street for the foreseeable future. I feel like I can't tell my mom, who is basically my best friend, because her and my dad will freak out. I hate not feeling safe. 

I am okay. Nothing happened. But it could have.",TwoXChromosomes,0,1439863837.0,12,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/3he76r/one_of_the_scariest_moments_of_my_life_just/
Need to vent about street harassment and an unsupportive SO,"I moved to the city for the first time in January and I've been enjoying it for the most part. Because we had a very, very cold winter and spring, I stayed bundled up for a long time and didn't experience much street harassment - only one or two incidences from January-May.

Now that it's summer, the tables have turned. I have long legs, lots of curly blonde hair and boobs. It's hot and I'm not going to hide myself under layers of clothing, but what I wear isn't that revealing at all. But I still get catcalled, sometimes at the rate of one to two times a day. As you can see, the rate has increased dramatically and it's taking a toll on me.

The first time it really escalated, I texted my boyfriend, who is ftm (it's relevant, I swear). Convo goes like this:

&gt; Me: Home. Got fucking catcalled again. I give up. I'm gonna cut off all my hair and wear a binder and a full length muumuu.

&gt; Him: You just need to wear headphones. Don't let one stupid person ruin your fun night. And don't joke about wearing binders, people goes through years of pain with no other options. You got catcalled, it happens to every girl who lives in the city there is no reason to overreact or let it ruin your fun or the person you are. It's just one of the small sucky things of living in the city.

The comment about binding was terrible and I apologized for that, but it bugged me how he just invalidated my feelings about the whole experience. Fast forward to tonight.

&gt; Me: Went to CVS. Got called a fucking slut by a passerby.

&gt; Him: You just need to get headphones babe.

&gt; Me: I shouldn't have to wear headphones to be treated like a human being!!!

&gt;Him: it's the city it happens.

&gt;Me: I need empathy not advice. You of all people should understand that words hurt.

&gt;Him: Okay you're just getting nasty now so I'm just going to leave you alone.

I just don't get it. He's been in situations where he's been in legitimate danger because of his trans status, but somehow he just can't empathize and make the connection between that and me being made to feel unsafe because of my gender and my body parts that I can't hide or alter – not that I should have to. And yeah, sunglasses or headphones might cut down on some of the abuse (but not all of it, like he assumes) but that still doesn't solve the problem.
And maybe I am overreacting and maybe after I've been here a few years I won't care. But I don't want to be desensitized! I don't want to just nonchalantly accept that level of violence and sexism. I just... idk.

TL;DR: Trans boyfriend can't make connection between catcalling and structural sexism and it sucks.",TwoXChromosomes,5,1404697845.0,13,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2a0h90/need_to_vent_about_street_harassment_and_an/
"I got street harassed, I reacted badly, and now I think my harasser might be staking me out by my apartment building. Any advice? [TRIGGER: stalking, harassment]","I just moved to Washington, D.C. from a smaller city out west to do a semester-long internship. While I've been harassed on the street at home, I feel like it's been more frequent and more virulent while I've been here. It happens at all times of day, regardless of what I'm wearing (not that it matters, whatsoever) and in all sorts of situations and locations. I'm usually pretty good at putting up my bullshit blinders and just ignoring street harassing scumbags, but a recent street harassment incident has left me really scared, really intimidated and really pissed off.

I was on my way back from a yoga class on Sunday afternoon when, not twenty feet from the front door to my apartment building, a man standing on the corner whistled at me. 

Again, usually, I just ignore this stuff and refuse to engage with that kind of behavior, but something happened this time that made me snap. I was physically tired, from my class, but also tired of feeling unsafe, freaked out and sad every time I leave my apartment. I flipped him off as I walked away, without looking back. He immediately shouted, ""Asshole!"" back at me. (Not what I was expecting from a street harasser -- I've heard ""bitch"" and ""whore"" before but such a gender-neutral insult was surprising). Again, out of character, I yelled back to him, ""No, you're the asshole!"" as I walked into my building.

I immediately regretted it and wished that I had just ignored him, but I forgot about it pretty quickly and went on with my life. 

However, when I was getting off the Metro on the way back from work tonight (Monday), I saw the same man standing at the top of the escalators with another man. (I should note that my apartment building is right above this Metro stop -- the place where I saw him again is about 30 feet from where the whistling happened). Luckily, I was with a friend, and as I passed by him, I deliberately didn't make eye contact or even look in his direction, and when I glanced back, he wasn't looking at me. It's pretty normal for people to hang out under the covered area by the escalators, but something just made me feel like he was waiting for someone.

I want to think that my response somehow deterred him from harassing other people, and that all of this can just be chalked up to some huge coincidence -- maybe he lives or works around here and we just overlap because we share a neighborhood. But I've always been told to follow my instincts, and something about this feels weird.

I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I'm reading too much into this, if I'm blowing it up too much or not enough, if I should get the police involved, if I should tell my building's front desk/security people. I've kind of thought that maybe I should see if he's hanging around the next few nights and proceed from there, but is that risky, or the right move at this point? I would really, really appreciate any advice, feedback, stories, etc. I know I'm not alone in this, but it sure feels that way.

**TL;DR A guy whistled at me as I was walking into my apartment, I flipped him off and a small shouting match ensued. Saw the same man near my apartment tonight. Wondering if I should be concerned.**

Has anyone else felt unsafe in their apartment complex?,"Posting for a friend (f) who recently moved by herself from Chicago to Las Vegas.

 &amp;nbsp;

A little background on the issue: my friend moved to an apartment complex in Las Vegas after being accepted to UNLV. The complex is for lower income individuals but is relatively nice so she decided to sign a year long lease. Once she arrived in LV, the management office assigned her to an apartment that she did not agree to initially but after a few hours of discussing with the office manager, she was able to move into the apartment she viewed during the walkthrough a few months prior, which is on the 3rd floor. You do not need to have a key to get into the apartment complex but you need a key to enter each apartment (obviously).

Since moving in she has been approached by numerous guys asking if she's married, dating someone, etc and this occurs almost on a daily basis. Sometimes it's the same group of guys and sometimes they're new guys. Her usual response is a polite, ""I'm in a relationship"" and walks away. Last night it became more aggressive when at 8pm she gets knocking at her door. The knocking stops after about 5 minutes but then 10 minutes later she hears it again. This morning she opens the door to go to class and there was a note on her door that read ""When your Ready 4 Tu call me Ill Be There in 2 min Call me. Rigo 702-619-xxxx"".

Thank God for That Officer,"I was walking from a parking lot along a busy road heading to work after a doctor’s appointment I had that morning. I turned onto the sidewalk about 20 feet in front of two men who looked to be in their mid-20s. As soon as I began walking on the sidewalk, they started catcalling me in the most disgusting, obscene way I’ve ever heard. I don’t even know if catcalling is the right word. Is it catcalling if two men are yelling in graphic detail about how they’re going to anally rape you? 

It was 9:30 in the morning walking down a busy road (I work downtown in a midsize city), broad daylight, cars going by, and these men didn’t care. They yelled about my appearance, my walk, and my ass, and when I didn’t turn around, they yelled about how exactly they were going to fuck me anally. It was only us on that sidewalk; it was a busy road for cars, not pedestrians during the work day. Cars are going by at 40mph. There’s a good chance if the men grabbed me no one would have seen. I know I don’t look at sidewalks as I’m driving (unless there’s a crosswalk of course). 

I was so scared. I’m usually a pretty bold person, sometimes too bold. I punched a guy in a bar who grabbed my ass once, and I told another one his mother should have raised him better. But when those two men were hollering at me, I was so terrified I was shaking. All I could do was pick up the pace (but not run because I didn’t want to seem like a victim to them!), put my head down, and hope they didn’t get closer to me. 

Then, I looked to my side and saw a police car stopped at a red light. I made the decision to wave him down. I hesitated because if he didn’t see me, the two men would surely be furious that I tried to get the police’s attention. But thankfully, he saw me and I told him that the two men behind me were yelling awful things at me. He said, “I’ll talk to them” and I don’t know what he said, but he stalled them until I was across the street. As I turned the corner, he was still talking to them. 

This incident made me feel so unsafe. I was walking two blocks down Main Street in a city known for being safe. At 9:30am. On a weekday. If I’m not safe then, when and where will I ever be? If I had been a few blocks over into the quieter part of the neighborhood, they could have gotten away with horrible crimes without anyone hearing. 

What made those men feel like they had the right to my body? What was wrong with them that they prioritized voicing their sick fantasies over an innocent person feeling safe? They had to have known I was scared. 

Thanks for reading this long post. I really needed to get this off my chest.

"I had a dream I was raped, and now I can't get over it.","Made an account to post this, for my privacy and such. And I'd like to apologize now, this is going to be a long one. 

So, just a little back story before I jump in. I have always been a troubled sleeper. I have aniexty, so my sleep patterns generally reflect that. On good days, I sleep better and vice versa. 


This whole past week I've had a really hard time falling asleep. I've started a new job and I have been put on a closing shift. I have to walk from my job to a back street where I park my car at about 11:30 pm. I live in a fairly safe area of my city, but a city is a city. On the particular night I had this dream, a coworker pulled me aside and told me he saw me walking home a few nights earlier. I remember exactly when hes referring to, because two...rough-around-the-edges type guys were walking towards me. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. But, my coworker told me that after I walked past them, they stopped and starred at me walk away from them for a while, talking to each other the whole time. My coworker slowed down and stayed beside them until they were out of sight and then circled around and made sure I got to my car okay. I don't know if this incident is what triggered my dream, but it made me feel very unsafe. 


Fast forward to the horrible dream. I could not fall asleep. I tossed and turned for what felt like hours. When I finally got to sleep, I started having a really vivid dream. I was walking home at night from somewhere, nowhere in particular. When I saw a guy taking his picture with people. I approached him and asked if I could get one too. Just about this time everyone cleared out and it was just me and him. He leaned in like he was going to take it and grabbed around my shoulders and under my legs. I won't go into to the gory details, but it was terrible. I remember screaming for help, but my voice was barely a whisper. After it was over, I could barely walk. This is all in my dream, mind you. But, I swear it felt like real pain. When I eventually went home, this guy was trying to get in. I locked myself in pretty good, but he eventually got in my apartment through a vent in the ceiling. This is just about when I woke up. 


It was terrifying. I was in a cold sweat and i was sobbing. I felt like someone was watching me. I laid in bed all day, terrified to go outside. I eventually had to go to work, but I never shook the feeling off. I feel genuinely scared in my own house now. I felt scared driving home from work, and stopping at the gas station. 


I have never been abused or mistreated sexually before. I don't know what started this. But, even though I know it was a dream, I feel like I was used. I don't know how to move past it or how to feel secure on my own again.

Scared of saying no,"\*\*This could get uncomfortable because this post deals with some stuff like sexual harassment and assault.\*\*

Something that I've realized for quite some time but ended up being a pretty big deal more recently in my life is that for various reasons I have a lot of trouble asserting myself, telling people when they're making me uncomfortable, and trouble being honest about it even if asked. I am of course for the most part referring to situations involving sexual things that to varying extents make me uncomfortable.

My parents separated and my mom made it known to me that she was worried that my dad would do things to me. He never really did anything sexually to me, but he is very emotionally abusive and he had primary custody. I know he's a marital rapist, not just from my mom but his second wife. There was one weird incident where he was moving in close like he was going to kiss me on the mouth, but he didn't. I still felt weird, of course. Primarily, though, it was his bullying that made me feel unsafe in my own home. I just moved out late last year because I couldn't take him anymore.

In the past I had a guy friend that I was close to who made me really, really uncomfortable on many different occasions. Sometimes he'd just decide to put an arm around me, which in itself doesn't seem like such a big deal, but it felt like an invasion of my personal space, and then I'd get upset, and he'd ask ""What's wrong?"" but I felt like he'd get mad if I was honest. He took advantage of things like hugs to put his hands on my butt, lots of times over. He'd also hold onto me for a creepily long amount of time (he is a large guy and I'm very petite, like less than 100 lbs., so if he wanted to do something I prob couldn't have stopped him). I was too scared for the longest time to tell him to stop feeling my butt, and when I did it was in a typed message (to which he said he hadn't realized he'd been doing it. yeah, right). This one time he gave me a hug and the tail of my shirt rode up just a little, and he started rubbing the skin on the small of my back, and I quickly reacted by jerking back, to which he asked ""What's wrong?"" again. I'm not sure that I really said anything in response. I remember a time he put his arm around me, but instead of putting his hand on my shoulder, he stuck it under my arm like he was trying to surreptitiously feel the side of my breast, so I just clamped my arm down really hard to keep his hand from reaching ahead too far (a mutual told me that the guy bragged about doing stuff like that, confirming my suspicion). He'd force me to talk about sexual stuff that I didn't want to talk about. One conversation he ended up instructing me on a method of masturbation even though I really didn't want to talk about that stuff. He tried to nickname me BB (for Booty Baby), which I found really demeaning. He tried to kiss me without asking once, but that surprised me so much that I literally screamed ""NO!"" and broke away and ran into my house (we were in my yard. He once lived down the street from me). 

I feel weird about this: once he \*asked\* to feel my ass, and I basically started to have a panic attack because I was alone with him and I still felt pressured by him after I tried to indicate that I didn't want him to (I don't remember what I said, but I remember panicking). Ironically afterwards he asked ""What happened to you?"" to which I said ""Nothing."" 

I'd think to myself: ""Big deal. It's not like he raped me or anything."" but I was honestly scared of something like that happening, and I'm not the only girl he tried stuff with. I felt isolated in a lot of ways for different reasons and I'd become friends with this guy, and I was afraid that if I called him out on that and other stuff he did that I'd lose him as a friend. This was during middle school, high school, and some in college. I still know the guy and occasionally cross paths with him.

Once a different guy I was and am close to offered to do stuff but I wasn't going to do anything sexual because 1. He might have been a little drunk or high, if I remember correctly 2. I just plain didn't want to do sexual stuff (I'm somewhere under that asexual umbrella, btw). So instead of doing anything sexual, we cuddled. But. . . he kept getting getting the chubs and I felt it up against me from behind. He explicitly asked if it was ok and apologized and stuff, but I just felt like I couldn't be honest about how uncomfortable it made me. I of course don't hold that kind of thing against him because he explicitly asked, multiple times over, and I lied. That's on me. But it still felt really uncomfortable and was another incident that made me feel vulnerable just on account of how scared I am of asserting myself, if that makes sense. I don't want the other person to feel bad, and I want them to like me.

Even more recently. . .

I made a friend, with which I am very close. I've kind of been forced to be more honest about this stuff b/c he would make sexual comments and jokes that made me uncomfortable and cumulatively it started to influence how I felt, like I didn't want to dress certain ways b/c I wanted to avoid sexual commentary about it, etc. He'd even ask me if stuff was ok, and I'd say it was, for the same reasons as before. But he would remind me at times that I could say no by literally saying that ""no is a perfectly valid option"" lol. So, I have gotten \*some\* better about it.

Even though I've gotten better at admitting it and asserting myself, it's still SO HARD to do. I'm honestly scared by my own lack of assertive self-preservation in these kinds of situations, but I still have trouble in spite of realizing that it is genuinely a problem. It's like because I want to keep a friendship, I'm afraid of making people mad at me, I often feel like I'm just too sensitive about stuff, and, sometimes I almost feel like I deserve it, I think. That stuff, and also just freezing up in general b/c I don't know how to react, holds me back.

&amp;#x200B;

Can any of you relate? How do you handle this kind of stuff? Why is it so hard to deal with?

Scared for my life - had to run away from a creepy guy today,"I just wanted to rant about something that happened to me today, and I hope this is an appropriate place to do so.   


To start off the story, I just moved back in with my dad a few days ago. My dad still lives where I grew up, a small city with a population of \~50,000.  I was hungry so I decided to walk downtown where I knew there were a few places to eat. It was later in the day (around 7 pm) and due to daylights savings, it was dark out. The walk to the place I wanted to eat at was about 15 minutes. When I was in the downtown area I noticed that it had changed a lot since I had last been there, my favorite wrap food place was closed as well as a lot of other local businesses that I enjoyed. I looked around and I started to feel a dangerous/creepy vibe. I'm not sure if it was because it was dark out, or because there were barely any people out but I did not feel right. I had never felt this vibe before. But I was hungry, so I continued on to the sub shop. When I entered, the bell rang and I waited at the counter to be served. I noticed the server took some time to come out of the back, but he made my sandwich and I sat down to eat there. I was the only person, other than the worker, that was in the restaurant.  


While I was enjoying my sandwich, I was looking outside to pass the time. I then noticed a man was across the street from the store and it appeared as if he was looking into the window of the sub place. I told myself that I was just being paranoid and that he was probably waiting for someone to pick him up. Then, after standing there for about 3 minutes, the man started walking towards the sub shop.  He didn't enter it at first, but he stood in the alcove outside of it. It appeared he was smoking a cigarette but I thought that it would be weird to cross a street to smoke. He then put his hand on the door and stands in front of it, as if to block it. That is when I started to really freak out. He had his hand on the door for what seemed like 2 minutes. During this time, I contemplated telling the sandwich maker, who was now in the back room, that I felt in danger but I convinced myself that I was just being paranoid again. To be safe, I put my wallet between my thighs so that it would be hard to access.   


The man then entered the store and the door rang. He did not walk toward the sandwich counter, but towards me. I tried to keep my cool so I kept eating my sandwich. He walked in front of my table and then stopped. He then walked towards the bathrooms that were right beside me and pretended to look in them. He said something to me but I was so freaked out that all I heard was 'look good'. I probably shouldn't have spoken but I said 'the bathrooms look fine'. I then had a good look at the guy and he was clearly on some substance. He then said 'no do I look ok'. I didn't know how to answer that question, and I felt trapped. The sandwich maker was also taking his sweet time to come out from the back. I mumbled 'fine,' because I didn't want to upset him and make the situation worse. He then went on to say 'you look like you've been through something tonight. Are you ok? A beautiful girl like yourself should not be eating alone.' He was approaching my table and I froze up. Thank goodness at this point the employee FINALLY came out of the back room and asked the guy if he wanted a sandwich. The guy walked beside me and up to the counter and started to tell a story completely unrelated to his sandwich order. I knew the guy wasn't there for a sandwich and all I could think about was my escape. Since the guy was distracted and no longer blocking me, I grabbed my things and ran out of the door, my half-eaten sandwich still on the table. I ran as fast as I could home, even with the sidewalks being icy.   


I guess I wanted to share this story to show how unsafe it can be sometimes to be alone at night as a woman. I never have thought of my city as being 'unsafe' but I sure don't feel like going out after dark anymore. I am sure that other women have had similar experiences to this and it sucks that we have to live in fear of being out alone sometimes. I hate that this happened. I hate that I felt threatened by someone while eating a sandwich alone at 7 pm (that's not even late at night!). I hate that my first instinct was to hide my wallet. I can't stop thinking that if I was a different gender that this whole situation would not have happened tonight. Thank you for reading my rant - I just really needed to vent.

Alone in Mexico City,"Hi all! Long time lurker first time poster, etc., etc. 

I’ve been seeing a lot of posts on this sub recently that discuss how different the male and female experiences are when walking around a city, whether in the day, at night, alone, with other female friends, etc. 

To that end, I was wondering if anyone could attest to the female experience in Mexico City? I’m living there alone for 2 months this summer to do some research, and am a bit worried. I literally know no one there, and I don’t want to find out the hard way that walking down the street alone at night or something isn’t safe, but I don’t know how to empirically investigate these various situations. I live in Chicago—if I were unsure about a neighborhood or time of day, I would first go with someone else, probably a guy, and then let that experience inform my feelings about going out on my own there/then. How do you figure these things out when you’re all alone? I have no one to test waters with. I don’t want to sit inside all summer, afraid of my own shadow. But I also don’t want to be stupid and reckless.

So, two questions really: 1) What’s your experience been like as a woman in Mexico City? and 2) How have you explored new cities before when you’ve been there solo? 

Also, I am a super pale/obviously American person, but fluent in Spanish, both of which seem to be relevant strata for this question (from what I’ve heard so far). ",TwoXChromosomes,1,1524976722.0,3,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8fp8bx/alone_in_mexico_city/

"Ladies, we gotta look out for each other!","Thought I'd share a story.  This happened third year of undergrad, I was 20 years old and lived in a dangerous area near my university.  In this area I'm used to men making me feel unsafe by catcalling, making concerning comments, trying to touch me, or following me.  Students have been sexually assaulted, jumped, and even murdered.  Late one night, my best friend and I needed to pick up some stuff from our friend in a particularly rough part of our neighborhood and had to walk because neither of us had brought our cars to campus by then.  As we made our way back to her apartment, we saw a girl walking in the opposite direction on the other side of the street.  I noticed that she looked kind of uncomfortable and was looking back every so often, soon realizing that there was a man walking about ten feet behind her.  I could tell that they were talking on and off but she looked uncomfortable.  I pointed it out to my friend but the street was deserted, we were alone, and we weren't sure if she knew him or not, as she was occasionally turning around to speak with him even though she looked upset.   We continued on our way.

&amp;#x200B;

The two of us got about halfway down the block, with me getting progressively more disturbed by what I just saw.  I kept imagining getting a student text alert from the police department describing a horrible crime against a girl we could have helped.  I'm only 5' but my friend is around 5'9"" and if there were three of us we could probably take him if he did turn out to be a threat.  I turned to my friend and said that we needed to go back, something doesn't feel right.  My friend replied, ""Literally about to say that, let's go.""  We turned and basically sprinted back down our side of the street until we reached the pair again, following across the street a few feet behind the man.  Both of us grabbed our mace out of our bags and clutched them tight as we ducked behind cars and carefully monitored the situation, trying to stay hidden so we at least had the element of surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

The girl reached her apartment and quickly unlocked the door and we froze, 100% ready to jump into action if he did anything scary.  She then turned and stepped aside as the man entered behind her.  Still seemed a bit weird because of the body language between the two but maybe they were dating and had gotten in some kind of argument.  Not sure.  So, sorry to be anticlimactic, but the guy was probably no threat.  The point of this story is that we all need to look out for each other and have each other's backs in the world, because sometimes I think about this and hope that one day, if I'm ever in this situation, that a random pair of strangers would care enough to help me.",TwoXChromosomes,0,1540175293.0,1,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9q9k71/ladies_we_gotta_look_out_for_each_other/
The paranoia of the solo female traveler,"I operate on a level of slight paranoia. Maybe I have way to many crime show, but I am always on guard. For a few days I was questioning what the point of this potentially stressful state of living was, and then two strangers followed me to my hotel room.

When I’m in a parking lot I always look around, just to see who else is there. I won’t stay at just any hotel, especially if it is questionably inexpensive. I don’t roam around alone at night in strange areas, especially if I plan on drinking. I try to be a cautious individual because I don’t want to become a statistic.

I was staying in a hotel in California, moving closer to my new place of employment. I walked over to the restaurant that shared a parking lot with the hotel, for an early dinner. My waiter was awkwardly nice, like he didn’t talk to girls much. He questioned whether I was staying in the hotel and I said I was and was just glad there was a restaurant near by, in an attempt to change the conversation. He dropped it. Our only real conversation was that of a waiter and a restaurant patron. A different man brought me my check, I paid and I left.

I walked back to my hotel room on the second floor and as I was closing the door I saw out the window that the waiter was looking up at my room in the courtyard. I had about enough time to text my friend about what I had just seen and there was a knock on my door.

I looked through the peephole and there was a man I did not recognize. I quickly texted my friend that I had been followed (another response of paranoia…if something happened to me, at least someone would know…). A nervous-looking man said hi after I opened the door. I asked if he was at the wrong door, as he was calling over someone else. The waiter from the restaurant came into view and they both began questioning whether I was alone and trying to convince me to let them into my room.

I travel alone a lot. I have traveled to foreign countries by myself. I comfortably travel the U.S. by myself, while maintaining my guard up and trying to make smart decisions. But I have never known of any man following me to my place of residence.

After saying no several times, and refusing to give them my number, they left. I stood, peaking out the window, in shock. How could someone think that this sort of advance would be welcome? It reminds me of when you’re walking down a road and a random car honks at you, or guys across the street holler at you. Does this ever work?! How is it possible that men still treat women this way in the U.S.? We are possibly one of the most empowered-female nations. And yet, women continue to be treated as objects and not viewed as deserving of equal rights, respect and personal space.

Shortly after this interaction with the two males I packed up my belongings and checked out of the hotel. Not only did the hotel front desk agent not care, I was still charged for the room, at which I spent a total of two hours. I somehow felt like I had been re-victimized, again disrespected and devalued. In reality nothing happened to me. I still left because initially the agent did not want to give me a new room and then I came to the conclusion that I had already been watched and followed, it would likely happen again.

Perhaps in the eyes of these men this gesture was harmless, meant to compliment me, or something along those lines… But all I felt was uncomfortable and unsafe.

It is difficult to be a female traveling alone. You have to be smart. You have to look out for yourself. It can be such an incredibly frustrating ordeal. All I wanted to do was eat food and go back to my room to hang out with my dog and read. I had been planning on booking the hotel room for several more nights. I had even planned on visiting the restaurant during that time because the food was good and the place was lovely. All of that was abruptly ended. My plans, feelings and wants no longer matter. I had to make sure I was doing the smart thing, even if it wasn’t the easiest thing.

I’m staying in a new hotel now. I spoke to the police and they plan on having a conversation with management. I contacted the corporate office of the hotel chain and am awaiting a response. These are the only actions that I can take. I somehow still find myself frustrated. In the words of my father “move forward”, and I fully intend to. That was always the plan. It is always the plan. I won’t stop traveling. I won’t let this one incident ruin my travels but sometimes I just can’t help but become angry.

Being a woman, even today, is harder when it comes to traveling than being a man traveling on his own. I can’t just do absolutely everything I feel like doing on a whim, without considering the situation. I can’t do anything that would make myself an easy target. I have to consider whether it really is safe to walk somewhere, or go somewhere at night by myself, like a local bar.

It’s bullshit. I am a human being. I deserve to be respected in my endeavors so long as I am not encroaching on those of another individual. When those men followed me to my room and knocked on my door they justified my feelings of paranoia and encroached upon my comfort and mental state.

Why, as women, do we have to feel afraid? More likely than not, nothing will happen to us. But I know people who have become victims and suffered at the hands of another human being. They did not deserve it. We do not deserve the mental anguish. We should be able to enjoy life to the fullest without being afraid. Being a woman shouldn’t feel like “just the worst” at times.  There are times where you do not want to talk to anyone else, and guess what, sometimes we don’t want to talk to anyone either. Don’t tell us to smile. Don’t force your will upon us.

I guess all that I would like to ask for, from all the men out there, is to treat us with dignity and respect. We want to live a life without fear, with the ability to pursue our dreams. Don’t diminish our worth with your ignorant words. We are as you are. Respect that.

TLDR: While I was traveling alone two guys followed me to my hotel room, talked, nothing happened, but it was still a reminder of the potential ease with which we can be victimized.

I never thought I would ever be in a situation where I could feel so powerless.,"I have always been strong, independent and cautious. I never had a situation get out of control and I did not believe others were so completely helpless but I learned a hard lesson last week. 
I hate to use the C word because its shaming but I have no other description for this guy. 

For a little back story, about 5 years ago I worked with this guy for a year and we bonded because we were picked on by a clique at work and it was like high school pettiness stuff.

We became friends and he asked me to hang out after work one time. We went to dinner and he paid without asking me. The second time I went to help him look for a new apartment. The third time I helped him move in and we went to dinner. I got the hint that maybe he wanted to date. He was awkward and seemingly shy, maybe a touch of aspbergers because he had no sense of humor or irony. He took everything literally.

So I thought I would move it to the next level and suggested we watch a movie at his new place. I never heard from him again, and we were not working together at that point. I didn't think anything of it and we got in touch a few years later and stayed friends. We went to church a few times and a few plays in a group setting. I found out he was actually 10 years older than me instead of the two he said and that he smoked.

So fast forward to two weeks ago. I had a party that he came to and everything was fine. He calls me two days later and invites me to see an artist I like. I said yes because I love the museum. So he picks me up and we are driving in the totally wrong direction. ""Where are we going AF? The museum is the other way""
""Oh, we are going to the artists grave""
""oh, ok, I thought we were going to the museum.""

It was a half hour drive out in the suburbs where I was expecting the five minute drive to the museum. The day went fine, we met some others there. Went home.

Then he said he was going to NYC later that week for a day trip and asked me if I wanted to go, everything was already paid for. We would leave at 6am then come back at 6am the next day. I said sure, why not, if its free.

So I wake up at 6 and he txts me that he will be late and to make it 7.30.  Then he shows up at 8.30 with no explanation. I was going to slip out early so as not to wake my roommate but he came and knocked on the door waking her up. She was pissed.

So we drive to NYC and he stays in the passing lane the entire way. Not a considerate driver. I had never been to NYC and he told me to not talk to strangers and to avoid eye contact. He is from a small town in Iowa but I grew up in Hotlanta. I knew I would be fine. I am not afraid of strangers and I keep mace everywhere. NYC didnt scare me.

We arrive and check in the hotel. Luckily the hotel gave us two rooms for the price of one. I was relieved I would have some privacy. We go meet up with his friends a few blocks away which consisted of an elderly woman and her adult son. They were all part of a photography club.

He told me he made reservations for dinner for us in Queens so we went. 
It was very expensive and I had a salad and soup because I am not employed and broke. At the end of dinner he suggest we just split it 3 ways. They all had full meals. So my $10 salad became a $40 bill.
I was annoyed. 

Then we stayed and they took pictures for two hours. I took a bunch too, but he said he didnt get the shot he wanted because it was cloudy. it was very cold and I only brought a dress and a light jacket because he said we would only be there one night.

We then went to times square and took more pictures. The whole time he is walking slow and said he wanted to call it a night because he hurt his leg a few months ago and was supposed to be wearing a brace so I said ok. We cut the night short.

He said we were going to wake up at 6am to take photos of the sunrise from Brooklyn the next day. We agreed to stay until 1pm so we could meet my friend in Brooklyn for lunch and take more photos.

He wakes me up and we drive to Brooklyn but get there at 7.30 and it was too late for the sunrise. We park and walk the bridge and he takes photos for 2 hours. I was very bored at that point as I thought we were going to walk around Brooklyn. So 9.30 he said we have to go back and meet his friends again.

We go and grab breakfast in a little diner. Then we stop at a church to take pictures. We then go to his friends apartment at about 10.30 to pick them up. I said I will wait downstairs because I dont know them very well and they have a studio apt so it might be cramped. I thought he was just going to buzz them down. I ended up waiting downstairs for an hour with no response to phone calls or txts to AF.
Finally he comes down and said he forgot his bag at the diner. Its me, him and the elderly friend walking to the diner. Now all of a sudden he doesn't have a leg problem and is hauling ass there. We couldnt even keep up.

No bag at the diner or church. He sits and starts crying, saying he always loses things and is stupid for leaving it. I said we should pray for it but he gave me a dirty look and told me that we cant afford to go home because all of his bank account information was on his ipad. He lost that and his $2000 camera. 

He said we had to go to the bank and sort out his money situation. I said ok, that was more important than meeting my friends. So he takes me to the bank and tells me to get money out. I asked why and how much would I need? He said we were staying until 8pm so that he can take a picture of the sunset. I was like how will you do that without a camera?
He said we were going to go buy a new one.

I told him that I did not make arrangements to stay that late and I did not feel safe getting up at 6am and having him drive us 8 hours home on little sleep. We wouldnt get home until 4am.
He said he can chug two mountain dews and he would be fine to drive. He then questioned why I couldnt stay. I told him my roommate works night shift and my dog would need me. I didnt tell him that I didnt shower, i was bored because we didnt see anything yet, and that I was tired. As an adult it is my right to not want to roll into my house at 4am and wake my roommate.

He then turned to me and said ""We agreed this morning at breakfast, you said you didn't want to stay late but you would because YOU WOULD BE A GOOD GIRL""
I was super creeped out right at that moment. I am a good friend and a bad bitch. I record myself talking because men always tell me I say things that I didnt think I said and I thought I was going crazy, but I have never used the phrase ""be a good girl"" in my entire life.

I knew this guy was insane. I started cussing at him in the street and people were staring. I told him I never said that and never agreed to stay past 1pm. He then turned to me and asked will I pay for the gas if we go home now.
I said absolutely. Then he said no, we are staying. I told him I wanted to go home. He told me i could ""take the fucking train"".
I then was forced to agree with him and stay. He had my laptop locked in his car. I walked away to cool off but didnt let him out of my sight. I was stuck in NYC with a psychopath.

A minute later he said he didnt want any tension between us and said I could go see my friend for lunch. It was already too late and my friend was pissed.

Then we went to another part of town to buy a new camera which took two hours. He spent another $1500 on it. I was so bored. I was calling everyone I knew to tell them I was being held hostage. When he was finished he came over and smiling said ""Thanks for waiting hun!""

Wow, this guy is oblivious. We then went back to his friends apartment and I went up. The whole place reeked of cigarette smoke. It was so bad it burned my skin. I excused myself and said I would wait downstairs. 
I then walked around the block for two hours before I heard from him again. He was like lets go to central park to take photos. So we did. I hid from him but kept him in my sight in the park. We were there an hour.

We then went to Queens to take more photos. He asked me why I didnt like his friends because I wouldnt stay in the apartment. I told him the smoke really bothered me. He thought I was still being rude. 

We took more pictures in Queens for a few hours and I was not talking or doing anything. I just wanted it to be over. So the sun sets and we head back at 8. I thought, ok we will go home, his friends were in bed at that point. 

Nope, he wanted to go up and show them. I wanted to say goodbye to them because they were nice people. We ended up staying until 10pm. I excused myself early again because it was smoky and waited outside.

We head out on the road and AF asks if I am mad at him because I am being so quiet. I didnt want to start trouble so I said I was just tired.
I was completely powerless and just wanted to get home. I had no idea what his plans were.

He chugs his mountain dew and I fell asleep. I wake up to him asleep at the wheel going 80 and swerving all over the road. I demand he stop and let me out. We stop and I said either I drive or I am hitchhiking home. I called everyone I knew to come get me at 3 in the morning. He said no, i didnt know his car like he did.

He bought coffee and seemed more awake and said we were not far from home and to get in the car. i did even though i felt super unsafe. I had appts the next day and my dog to get back to. Driving back I keep checking my phone maps to see how close we were. He then asked ""are you posting bad things about me on facebook to your friends?""

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I thought I was going to die or go to jail for beating this guy up. We finally get to my block and I took off my belt so I can grab my bag and jump out. He stops the car and pulls over. I thought ""I can punch him in the neck and run!""

He said it was illegal to drive with my belt unbuckled and he would not move the car. I rebuckled and he drives up to my apartment. I unbuckled as soon as we were in front but he didnt stop. He went around the parking lot and dropped me off two houses down. I jumped out and told him to go fuck himself. 

My roommate was pissed I woke her up. He unfriended me on facebook the next day before I could block him.

"I'm considering becoming an egg donor - anyone have experience with this, hints, things to look out for?","I'm an early-20s female living in Chicago and I've known for a while that I don't want to have kids of my own, or at the very least go through pregnancy and give birth.

Anyone know of reliable clinics/programs that do this (or more details on the first couple of links when I google ""egg donor chicago"")?

About to graduate college and I need advice,"I am in my senior year of college and I love my life even if I have had my tough times. My freshmen year I was very naïve. During high school I went to a very conservative boarding school. I never had much experience with men, but the contact I did have with them was always very positive. I never distrusted men before. So I guess when college came around I didn’t have the street smarts that I needed. Anyway, I met a cute guy and we really hit it off. I would tutor him in Spanish, but I always made sure it was in a public place. However after some time I started to trust him. One day he asked if I could help him with an online quiz and asked if I could come to his room. I agreed thinking it would be harmless, I even brought a book with me to keep me entertained while he worked on the quiz. But when I got to his room I knew something was up. His lights were off and the only light was coming from his tv. He was watching Rugrats, so even though I was cautious I didn’t find it too threatening. He was lying on his bed with only his pants on, so I sat on his desk chair. Shortly afterwards things went badly and he raped me. I lost my virginity to my rapist on dirty dorm carpet. I was a mess afterwards but I covered it up because I knew if my dad found out about it he would pull me out of college and send me to some private all girls college. So I kept my secret to myself. Throughout the years I found out that I was not his only victim. He would go out on nights where he knew girls would be very intoxicated ex.Halloween, Homecoming, Beginning of the Semester and would actively seek out the most intoxicated girl he could find and have sex with her. He would also record him having sex with girls without their consent of recording. 
Even though I thought I was over it I guess it still creeps up on me, especially in my subconscious. I’ve told my best friend about my rape. We had a discussion through Facebook so our conversation is saved. My junior year I met my current boyfriend and one evening he went through my Facebook. He eventually confessed about reading it and although I was not happy that he went through my things it was a relief that he knew about my past. 
So now to my senior year. My rapist is a law enforcement major and is doing really well in college. He will most likely get a very good internship with the Chicago Police Academy and become a police officer. I wish I would have come forward right after the event happened but I was ashamed that I was so naïve. I was also upset that I let my dad down, the one time I was given freedom and I let a guy take advantage of me. 
But here is my dilemma. My boyfriend is furious with my rapist and wants to get revenge before my rapist graduates. I want to have this whole thing behind me but my boyfriend is stubborn and won’t let this go. What should I do? I’m confused and upset that this situation is back in my life. I just want my rapist to graduate and get out of my life forever.

"Catcalling, talking to a fellow catcallee","okay guys, Catcalling story. I wonder what I should have done two days ago and what I should have done today. 

Two days ago some guy on a bike said that he ""liked my butt"" as I was walking to class. I flipped him off (perhaps a poor reaction). He turned around and started following me asking to talk. Luckily, I was on a busy street and just ignored him. But yeah, it was definitely a situation where I felt unsafe.

Today I was walking to class and the same guy told a pretty African American woman that he ""liked her hair,"" then he started laughing. I was walking behind this woman and felt like I should have told her, don't worry, this guy is just a weirdo who likes to make girls feel bad/be a douche. But I didn't say anything. Should I have? I could tell that she was looking at her hair in the windows of the shops we passed.

When family members don't want anything to do with you anymore,"So this like a rant. If someone could tell me other subs that you can talk about personal issues/problems than let me know as well, because other than this one I couldn't think of any.

Anyways as an only child as life was lonely enough growing up, plus the fact my parents are strict religious muslims and I had a terrible upbringing and depression/anxiety issues from a real young age. A lot of bad things happened, which i'm trying not to mention otherwise it would take up pages. But either way, my dad has company job transferred to kansas city a few years back, whereas I was living in Phoenix, AZ my entire life before that and had some friends. 

The thought of moving to such a small city in general (i'm a big city person) and especially kansas city, was repulsing. But i had no choice to go because I could not afford my apartment rent anymore and cost of living with minimum wage and a few credits of college. Fast forward, life in kansas city was utterly depressing and things between my dad and me got worse. I hit the point of depression/anxiety that hit the roof, and never had felt it that strong for so long despite of being on very strong effective addicting medications.

Came here on vacation to dallas over a few months ago, and decided to my mom that I do want to go back home to my dad and that horrible house and most of all that city that had nothing for me. My parents have been having marital issues on and off for a long time as my dad is verbally abusive, and so my mom agreed that we would stay in dallas. We stayed with close relatives on her side of the family for a few weeks which gave me the time to realize that I cannot get through school, have a place to live for me and my mom etc without his financial help. I wanted them to stay together and work it out which they have been doing, he comes visits every 2 weeks for 3-4 days on his days off from work.

Now this is the part where things get a little sticky. My entire dads side of the family (or most) live here in Dallas. However after a family event that all the relatives went to in Chicago a few years ago, I really did not want to attend anymore big family events or see any of my dads side of the family. Having the severe depression and anxiety, I didn't want to be around people who I felt like didn't want me around despite the fact I was extremely close to a few of them when I was a kid (Which also till this day makes me sad). But when my parents announced to everyone from his side of the family that me and my mom moved here because of the environment in kansas city and so forth, I reluctantly decided to start seeing some of my relatives again.

At first a few of them made comments like how I distanced myself etc etc, but after going to their house (my uncle and his family are living with one of my older cousins and their family), I started feeling a little attached again to my family. Especially since after moving from Phoenix 3 years ago, I lost all that I knew or who I knew. I spent  the night for an entire week at my cousins house, and was enjoying not having to sit around alone as usual when i'm not at work or school. But yesterday night was my parents anniversary party, and I decided to walk a few streets down from the restaurant to have a few beers (which most of our family disapproves of/ or drugs very strictly). I came back in a much better mood, talkative, and very friendly which doesn't always happen when I drink. Of course some of the relatives could tell that I drank because of the smell, and little did I realize it would be my last time going to spend the night at my cousins again. We played games and such, but this morning I was woken up with a severe hangover that involved throwing up. Before even then, my uncle (who can be real judgemental and bipolar like my dad and the rest of his family) gave me a billion lectures on how horrible I am, and that nowone wants their kids around a person who drinks etc. 

Although I never have drank in front of them/in their homes as respect, I didn't think that going out to do it would cause my uncle to tell me that my cousin (who used to drink for 10 years straight and party) did not want me to come again at his house. It made me feel like that I did something real stupid after drinking but I didn't. 

It really is crushing me right now, because after distancing myself from my family members for a few years and than just starting to feel close to them again in years, it's all ended because of something so small. While they have their gatherings, go out, play games and do whatever else, i'm all alone again. None of them had the same type of upbringing as me or depression/anxiety issues. And the cousin who drank and partied so much, had the nerves to tell my uncle he doesn't want me over again really just shattered me. Now I know all of them will be talking about me now that I am back home, and that the only people who I thought I might have in my life for a long time are gone. I'm 22 now, and at this point I'm not pleading or begging anyone to let me see them or reunite. If someone doesn't want me around (especially for such a small reason) than i'd rather not be around. Now i'm back to my lonely depressing life trying new medications, and waiting for school to start on Jan 15, so that way someday I can graduate and have a life of my own. My seasonal job that I barely work at is almost at it's end so i'm trying to find a new job. But coming home to an empty home and a broken family/memories has killed me over the years. What i've realized from others is that I need to focus on college more so that way I can atleast have a future, money, etc which I am doing now instead of partying or hanging out with friends or people who I thought would be a part of my life forever. Friends are getting harder to make as getting older, but the joy of being around family seems like it's forever gone. As my other cousins continue to get more attached to one another and not care that I won't be around anymore, I will to do everything I can to avoid them (incase in a few months or more that they decide to let go of this situation). Sometimes the people you love the most, don't care nearly as much about you. While your enjoying spending time with them and thinking about the good memories, their not even thinking about you. Sigh today has been so emotional and on top of that being hungover. Family members was all I had currently, but not anymore. It's just me by myself again, I wish I hadn't started to decide to reconnect with them to have my feelings shredded even worse this time. :(",TwoXChromosomes,4,1419292945.0,3,https://reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2q4dle/when_family_members_dont_want_anything_to_do_with/
A thought about catcalling that will hopefully lead to a good discussion!,"Every time I see a post or an article about the annoying male habit of catcalling, it's always the same question: ""What are these men hoping to accomplish? Do they think I'll think they're attractive? Do they think they're gonna get laid?"" And while it's a totally valid question, I think the answer to these questions is pretty damn clear:  

All they want is attention. I don't believe men who catcall think that they're doing anything complimentary or flattering to the women. They're literally just doing it to be mean and make women feel uncomfortable.

It's the adult version of the boy knocking over the girl's blocks in 4th grade. We need to teach children from a young age that catcalling is wrong, obnoxious, and is not nice to girls and women. But while we're educating (and re-educating boys), the best reaction, in my opinion, to some guy yelling at you while he drives by or says ""nice tits"" while you pass him on the street is to ignore him. (this of course can change if you're alone or feel unsafe - obviously then the best reaction is to get away from the situation as quickly as possible and/or call a friend/the police.) I'm talking more about what happens when you're on a crowded street or driving in your car.

Hollered at/threatened by bar security last night while I was walking past. Should I complain?,"I was walking home after a night out. My walk wasn't far, although probably a little unsafe for a tipsy female by herself. But I didn't really have a choice; and that shouldn't be the issue anyway.

So I walked past a pub, and I heard ""HEY GIRL. WHY ARE YOU WALKING BY YOURSELF?""

I turned around and one of the bouncers had walked after me a couple of paces. He was standing in the middle of the street, facing me with an aggressive stance and a ""It's me you should be afraid of"" look in his eye. 

I kept walking, but shot back a ""Why are you talking to a woman walking by herself?""

The guy was obviously a douche, but on top of feeling just normally threatened, it really concerns me that this is someone acting as 'security' for an establishment.

I'm going to make a complaint, but I guess I would like words of advice/support as how to go about it.

When it is hard to be a woman: a reflection on young womanhood.,"I would like this piece to encourage many comments and dialogue within this community here, and within our broader networks of friends and family. This is a reflection on a conversation I recently had with some friends.

I am happy and healthy today. The sky is blue and rosy, which makes me want to laugh. I am surrounded by women who are like and unlike me, and that is beautiful and painful at the same time. There is no true expression of universal womanhood, I  know that, but we are painting pictures of similar internal journeys when we are talking, just ourselves, in the early bits of the night. We are fighting self-loathing, when we know in our heads we are doing great and wonderful things, but our hearts don't feel it. You can say you have done enough as many times as you wish, but the words don't always stick. My sisters were born as girls, but wished as boys and that aches. That ache lasts, especially for them. And she has suffered abuse and neglect as a girl child, because sometimes it is unsafe for her to walk particular streets alone. But she is capable and goes anyway, but the warning still hurts. We are at odds with each other, as women. My friend does not tell me, but I can feel her eyes as I wonder if she can feel mine. Our bodies are not always ours, even when looking at the mirror. Who knew it would be so hard to eat. Just eat. Or just stop eating. Eat more greens. Whatever. So I look at myself and love myself today, hate myself tomorrow, and feel too weak to change anything. If today I can't seem to get out of bed or leave this room, well, perhaps that will pass with the weather and I will find people comforting again. But perhaps she will miss the fleeting beauty of life in her struggle because the world is sharp today. And no one really wants to feel the eyes. 

I think of my mother and the way she struggled and still struggles. I wonder if she knows what true happiness is, independent of men who have not loved her as she deserved but to whom she felt beholden. I think of my many mothers, the women who have shown me what strength is and what it means to be resourceful, women who work so so so hard and sometimes do not feel they will ever do enough. You are doing enough, but will you believe me if I say that. 

It is hard to think these things about depression and competition and image and violence and what is happiness, and it is a harder struggle to speak them. Truly, I wonder, what is normal and what is my own head and what is society and what is my family? How do you ask for help if you are not sure what is wrong? How do you talk about being a woman when you don't know if it feels good or bad? There are difficulties inherent in our lives and it can be hardest to talk about these problems with people who are most similar to us. That does not make our problems insignificant or wrong, even when we doubt the importance or necessity of speaking. It is so hard to find healing and we don't always know how to turn to each other. But I am here and I am open and listening, although I might not be able to speak myself, you should speak. It is hardest to say you feel nothing at all. And I will try to turn to you when I need it, I will work on that. Because when we look at each other our eyes will read the same: in this moment being a woman seems too hard.

"Ladies, what are the little things you do to protect yourself that men probably don't consider?","I know it was a while ago in internet-time, but recently I've been thinking about the [#YesAllWomen](http://time.com/114043/yesallwomen-hashtag-santa-barbara-shooting/) hashtag and some of the stories that were shared. It brought to light a lot of the little things that we women do, logically or not, to protect ourselves from violence and sexual assault - little actions or considerations that enter our minds almost daily, but which men may not realize that we do.

For me, it was taking my drivers licence with me whenever I went jogging - just in case the worst happened and I would need to be *identified*. I didn't even realize how fucked up that train of thought was until recently. :(

I also make sure my windows are shut and locked even on unbearably hot nights (no AC) because I live on the second floor and my window is close to the fire escape. It's statistically unlikely that someone will try to come in during the night, but it makes me nervous so I do it anyway.

And I should say that I am *not* someone that lives in fear - my ex used to joke that I was the only person he knew with no sense of self-preservation whatsoever. I live alone on the fringe of a really rough neighbourhood downtown, regularly walk alone in the city well after midnight (sometimes with earbuds in, gasp) and have gotten myself into (and out of) some really questionable situations while travelling solo in so-called ""sketchy"" countries. Despite all of that, I feel compelled to do these little things in my everyday life to protect myself.

"What are some things you feel you cannot safely do, that many men take for granted?","This question was posed after taking a long road trip with a close male friend. I road trip frequently alone, and have been in a few situations that have caused me to be very safety conscious while going solo. For example, my friend was surprised when I told him that I don't pull over at a rest stop unless there are multiple cars there, because of the fear that someone (male or female) can follow me into the bathroom with an unfortunate end goal in mind. He looked horrified as if I just opened a portal into a world he never knew existed, and responded with the fact that similar thoughts have never crossed his mind. I have a few other examples, but I'm curious to see if I share the same concerns as others, OR if I'm being irrational.

Any other petite girls here intimidated and scared of much larger men?,"I am a 23 y/o petite girl and I have a phobia of large men. I'm tiny. I'm 5'1 and weigh about 100+ lbs with clothes on. 

All my life I've been scared of how some big men get; I'm absolutely terrified of them. I know there's no way I could ever hope to fight one off if one wanted to harm me and it makes me feel weak and vulnerable in public. In college we had football players over 6'7 and 300lbs. I looked like a ragdoll compared to them and it blows my mind that some guys weigh as much as THREE of me. I know men are more violent and aggressive than women (I know some women can be too, but testosterone...) and it gives me nightmares. 
I have seen men fight with each other over petty arguments in just a few seconds. I have seen a couple barfights and I was so upset, I left out of fear for my own safety. I didn't want to be around those men if they could snap so quickly against guys their own size, what am I to them?  

I don't like to be out in public alone,normally I'm with my roommate and her boyfriend, but I obviously can't do that all the time. I took a self-defense course and dropped out after a few weeks when I realized how useless it was for me in practicality, even the other women towered over me. 

Is there anything I can do? and yes I've had boyfriends before but they weren't that big and sort of passive and maybe I'd call them meek? I didn't feel safe with them. 

I seriously start sweating and trembling around bigger men, I just feel that even if they didn't want to hurt me, they COULD, and it's makes me scared. I don't talk to them, I don't interact with them, I just want them to go away and leave me alone hopefully.Nothing has ever actually happened to me, but I dread and fear the day it might.

I feel so helpless at times in a land of giants.

"Am I ""ruining the image that women have worked so hard for""?","Am I ""ruining all that women have worked for""?

I'm eighteen, just about to finish my magnet high school. 
Once I get my diploma, I may go to community college, but not likely. Though I am rather intelligent, and I can easily learn without the school setting. I have a man I'm engaged to and plan to marry within the next two to three years, and will be moving into an apartment together. 

I've never had a job, and his pays well enough to support both of us. I'll be a housewife. He says he wants to get me a cat so I'm not alone while he's at work. My life will sort of consist of cooking, cleaning, sleeping, watching movies, playing video games and working out. And spending time with my husband while he's home. And whenever we plan to have kids, I'll be a full time mom. 

I know that I'm not below him because I'm a woman or plan to be a housewife. 

We have mutual love and respect, and we both like the way we've planned out our lives. But since we're young, we get judged for that. Since I've never had a job and I don't plan to pursue more education, we get judged for that. Since I want to be a housewife to care for the house, my husband, and eventually children, I get judged for that. I've had several women tell me I'm 
'buckling under my man to please him' and I am 'destroying the very thing women have worked so hard for-equality and freedom'. I have my freedom, he doesn't control me. And I am rather equal.

I'm just curious to what the women of Reddit think of what I'm doing-am I ruining the image of women today?


EDIT: I think most people did not read this last part- my question was, am I ruining the image of women today by becoming a housewife? I HAVE NOT ASKED for advice, or opinions. Almost 98% of these comments are telling how dangerous, shortsighted and foolish my plans are.  But I haven't asked for advice. 
I don't need to hear what you all think, and how I absolutely need to get a job because otherwise my life will be shitty. I don't need to hear things like ""what if he dies? What if he cheats on you?""  I just wanted to know if housewives affected the idea of feminism. 

EDIT2: I've mentioned this in the comments, but I figure I'll add it in, my boyfriend is going to be completely supportive and encouraging with whatever I decide to do. We both think it's better, and safer for me if I stay at home, which, means not working. But that wouldn't stop me from taking a few classes at the community college, or doing some volunteer work. Someone suggested I volunteer at an animal shelter (an idea that I absolutely love) Which I think is a good idea to keep me busy. And to the people asking what would I do if he loses his job, or can't find one. In his career field, he's almost instantly promised a job no matter where it is, so that's not exactly a concern. He is planning on getting life insurance, he's obviously worried about my safety and security if something were to happen to him.

"How do we, as women, balance genuine concern for our own safety with not being too afraid to experience things?","Hello ladies!

Here's why I am led to ask this question tonight:

I am on business for three weeks in Alexandria, VA. I've heard so much about how nice the area is, check out Old Town for many restaurants, shops, and bars, and it's only a short trip into Washington DC. I'm alone on this trip and I want to go see these things, but I keep hearing my mother's voice in my head telling me that's a terrible idea because it's dangerous to be a woman alone in a city. I grew up in a small rural town, as did my mother, so city life is something pretty foreign to her. 

Tonight, I thought about getting a ride from Uber and go into Old Town to have a drink or two and take in the atmosphere, but I keep second guessing myself if I should or not. I'm not by nature a tentative person, but I guess being out of my comfort zone doesn't make it easier. When I was at college I would go around town all the time by myself, even out to bars and I never had a problem. I've even second guessed going into DC tomorrow by myself. It's so weirdly unlike me that I don't know what to think. I know millions of women live their lives in cities and do things alone and don't think twice about it. Do I just need to get past myself or something?

So I guess what I'm asking is, should I get dressed and go enjoy myself tonight, or is it computer games and an early bedtime?

EDIT: I don't know if any of you who responded will see my edit but I just wanted to say THANK YOU! It means so much to hear everyone's words of encouragement and support as well as very good advice and recommendations. I did go out last night and found a really neat little Irish pub near the Potomac and had some delicious food and a couple cold pints. It was a bit weird at first, and I went into a couple different places first but they were all very busy and my awkwardness got the best of me so I left. When I did happen upon the pub I stayed at, I had a couple mid-40s dudes invite me to join them but I politely declined and sat at a perfect little table in the corner and soaked in the atmosphere. The people watching was great! 

Also walking around Old Town felt very comfortable. It is beautiful down there, and there were professionals, families, tourists, the whole nine yards so I felt quite safe walking around by myself. It was also the first time I've used Uber and that was also a very positive experience. My first driver even gave me a code for my first ride free. That was super nice of him, and my ride home ended up being in a Lincoln Town Car so I felt very fancy. 

Again, thank you all so much for the kind words, I'm somewhat overwhelmed by the response. It has been a major boost to my confidence and that's a change that has been very much needed in my life.

I currently live in a pretty big townhome with 2 roommates. 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, yard, close to my work etc. It's great and all but lately I've been feeling kind of, for lack of a better term, bored. The thought keeps creeping into my mind that I should at least try living on my own at some point in my life. I even find myself actively looking through rental postings online all the time. There are some major pros AND cons that I can think of. I'm wondering what those who have actually done it think though.

I live in a VERY expensive area. I have a decent job and can afford either a tiny shoebox in the better areas/ communities with better amenities or a larger place in the not so amazing neighborhoods. I'd probably be spending 1.5x what I pay now for rent. But it seems I would save in other areas (less for utilities, more control over utility usage, groceries for one with no one eating my food, less going out/ general influence to spend money with roommates)


Specific questions:

* Would you recommend better area or better place?

* How much (%) of your gross income do you spend on housing?
* Do you save more or less $ by living alone?
* Do you get lonely or do you like the independence?
* Do you worry about your safety/ feel vulnerable?
* Any contingency plan for if you were to lose your job or other unforeseen life event?

"Would you be put off by my ""flaws""?","
I am White/24m/muscular. So I recently broke up with a long term girlfriend. 5+ years. Before her I was essentially a virgin. Now this was not due to lack of interest, but rather a complete lack of understanding of women on my part coupled with an inability to trust someone enough to let them  in. No one ever taught me the ropes and I never picked up a single signal. Having dated a girl for years now...I was fucking stupid. I had beautiful girls throwing themselves at me, and I was oblivious.

Currently here are my issues as I see them:

0.) I don’t drink or smoke cigarettes, but I do 420 a few times a week. Mostly on weekends.

1.) I have been told by many that I give off the impression of being a tough guy. I don’t view myself as such, but I am “harder” than anyone else I know. I just generally lack emotion and base most decisions off of pure logic.. My political beliefs are libertarian/objectivist/constitutionalist and that factors into my “rugged individualism”.I won’t tolerate aggression, and I haven’t been in a fight since high school, but that’s because I make it clear if someone pushes me I’ll crush them, its not me being tough its me deescalating through clear physical superiority. I don’t indulge in many luxuries or amenities, and can sleep/eat/live anywhere. I am the ultimate in low maintenance.

2.)  I am a good guy and I love my circle friends, but I don’t express it emotionally. I also am very careful and only meet people through friends. In other words, if I don’t know you, and you don’t know my people/can’t be vetted by them...I will give you the cold shoulder or speak nonsense until you leave me alone. Even if I like you, I will be polite but you won’t know the real me.. I am not a passionate person...though I can fake enthusiasm quite well. In other words, I am a social butterfly when I’m in a good mood, but it is all superficial unless you meet the requirements of someone being able to vouch for you and passing my smell test. I have a small, but close circle of friends, and most decent people I meet tend to like me

3.) I work 2 jobs M-F. I pull in ~$3-3.5k post tax a month depending on hours worked on my night job. I am also looking at a $10k salary boost within 6 months at my day job. I am very well-spoken/intelligent and work in a corporate environment during the day, and work armed security at night. However, this leaves me no free time during the week. I am not miserly with my money, and my first girlfriend got a free ride, tons of jewelry, and never worked or paid for anything. Considering she cleared out my savings before breaking up with me I will be less generous in the future, but how much so I’m not certain. A woman could count on pressing needs being met, but I won’t shower anyone ever again.

4.) My car is from ‘86, and is a completely unsafe junker that any decent individual would not wish to ride in. I would not even allow a woman to get in it because it is literally a time bomb that will eventually kill me.  I was on the cusp of purchasing a loaded audi before the ex screwed me. I am looking at another 6 months with this thing.

 5.) I cook all of my own delicious meals. That said I now refuse to order take out because my ex wasted $100 a week minimum of my money on BS pizzas and fried foods that I disliked and conflicted with my diet. I have no issue bringing a girl out to a nice restaurant with quality food once every week or two.Again, My home cooked meals are flat out delicious, and its not just my opinion. Steak and onions, rice and beans with ham, chicken caesar salad, lentil soup, pot roast, Mediterranean omelets, quite a few indian dishes, a few thai dishes, and etc. My snacks generally include hummus and ajvar with baby carrots and celery, almonds, plain popcorn seasoned myself, protein shakes, and more of that sort of fare.

6.) I also lift 3 days a week, which means once again I have NO time during the week for anything other than work, exercise, and sleep. 

7.) I have some body image issues. I was overweight in the past and thus my skin isn’t loose, but doesn’t hug my muscles like I would like it to. My arms and legs are cut, but my midsection shows the signs of my former weight. I am working towards eliminating that completely in the gym. I am about 15%bf, and my lifts are impressive to a standard gym rat.

8.) I have embarrassing bumps on my scrotum from my ex picking at ingrown hairs. They are benign, but bother me a great deal aesthetically. 

9.) I am very sexually open, and I think it may turn women off. I am willing to do almost anything that doesn’t involve lasting damage or human waste. I love being dominated, anal play, and verbal humiliation; and I do “need” it every now and then. I particularly enjoy being penetrated, while being told I’m not good enough and then am “forced” to degrade myself further.  I know...it’s fairly weird. I also love romantic, slow sex with candles after a nice meal and movie (sensual) or fast, hard rough sex (agressive). I love orally servicing a woman, and I am quite good from what I understand. I devour both the pussy and asshole, and if I can’t toss a woman’s salad it is a huge turn-off to me. I can have vanilla sex or kinky sex, dominant or submissive, and I have an incredibly high sex drive. Sex is like breathing to me when I love someone. I want to share every bit of myself with them, and them to share every bit of themselves with me. Please reassure me, but don’t lie to me. If you met me you would never think I would be into these activities as I am about as alpha as they come.

10.) I own many firearms which are kept around my place, some hidden some open, and all are loaded. If a girl won’t learn gun handling/safety skills then she’s immediately not an option.

11.) I was always physically abused, as a child, and regularly by my ex. I have a pretty intense reaction to perceived threats if I’m surprised. My startle reflex operates far more quickly than my thought processes. I have punched people at half force or so in the face before I was able to pull the punch after they startled me. The good news is I am VERY difficult to startle as I am constantly aware of my surroundings. The bad news is it will take months for me to be comfortable with a girl touching me randomly.


How do I stack up? I have game, and I am quite good looking. However, several of these things really make me insecure and I feel like they preclude me from casual relationships. Would you date me? Everything I have said is accurate.I feel like no girl would ever want to be with me after writing that out. There are so many oddities and quirks. Please be honest with me.

How do you feel about a guy who has an interest in outdoorsy stuff?,"Bit vague I know - more specifically I've had comments made by people who've seen pictures of me on FB either shooting or posing in front of an debris shelter or fire I've made with a bushcraft knife, (because I'm proud of my work or equipment). The comments have been slightly negative/jesting in tone and usually made face to face. 

This isn't about people judging me based on images online (well only a small part, but that is what happens) it is how you women judge me about those hobbies/interests?

I'll put it this way ; I'm a guy who goes to art galleries by himself and (have taken women as well!), I'll sit and read political philosophy and give art-house esque films a good shot (enjoyed Tree of Life, Melancholia from last year for example) 

BUT I'll also go wild camping and long distance hiking alone with minimal equipment, practice bushcraft and build fires for fun, trains self defense and enjoys shooting guns and the like.

I've only visited Chicago semi-solo (i.e. flew there to see a friend for half the trip) from NY, so my expertise is pretty minimal on this subject.

To those of you who have traveled solo, was it as dangerous as people make it out to be (though I'm sure this depends on the country/region/city)? Was it better alone or would you have liked company? Y/N to hostels? How little did you pack? Where have you traveled? (etc.)",AskWomen,14,1431460759.0,21,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/35qyqy/any_advicetips_for_traveling_solo_as_a_young_woman/
How do you avoid and disengage creepy men at clubs //(gay 20M new to clubbing),"Yesterday I went to a pride after party at a gay club (under wear only dress code). The party was fab with hot guys every where. So I am dancing sexy as usual and this bulky muscular guy becomes interested. We then danced for a while, after which I left him. He then proceeded to follow me, and then proceeds to get unnervingly close after which he professes his absolute love for my person, insisting that I go home with him. At first, I felt flattered, but then chill crept down my spine. I wanted out. He couldn't, he wouldn't understand my overt queues that I was not interested in his highly esteemed personage. At the first chance to escape I immediately retrieved my possessions at the door and left.            My question to you is how do you effectively avoid and disengage these creeps while clubbing?

How do you handle being attracted to men while having to worry about your personal safety around them?,I'm a man so I'm not as generally fearful of the people I'm attracted to and so I am wondering how do people deal with wanting to spend more time alone with someone vs being cautious?

I'm moving to a new city and have always wanted to live by myself. Should I do it? What are the pros/cons of living by yourself?,"I'm in between getting a roommate for cost and for safety (girl living alone in big city) but I have always wanted to live in my own apartment. In between college and potentially getting married, I'm afraid of never being able to live by myself. People have sung praises about living alone, and I'm quite the introvert (because I like recharging alone, but I love hanging with people after) so I would love living alone, but my current roommate tells me that I'll end up lonely.

What was your favorite international city/country to travel solo? (I'm American),"I'm planning on another international trip this year and am doing it solo unless something changes. I've traveled alone and extensively before so I'm comfortable with that.    
But being female definitely makes me consider things like safety - so which countries/cities/areas did you enjoy traveling in solo? Did you feel safe?

How do you ladies manage traveling alone?,"So, I've been having some sort of quarter life crisis lately, and I just spontaneously decided to take a mini road trip for spring break. My friends and I are usually broke and I don't know too many people who have the motivation or the time for a road trip. I decided to go on my own, I'm just kind of throwing caution to the wind and buying a greyhound ticket to some other state in a couple of weeks. Has anyone on here ever gone on a vacation or a trip on their own? Did you manage to have a relaxing time? How did you make sure you were safe at all times?

As a man out last night with a lovely woman I think I have blown it - can you help me save it?,"So, I was out with a lady I have known for a couple of months and we have always gotten on well.  We were in the same place at the same time so went for a couple of beers, then dinner and a lovely bottle of wine, and another place for cocktails and I think we were having a great time.
Then we met another girl and went out dancing, all three of us - good times!  When we left I made sure the new girl got on her way but I did not make sure my original friend got home safe, in fact she was walking home and when she last saw me I had my arm around the new girl escorting her into a cab. Then I walked home alone and sent both girls a message first thing in the morning hoping they got home safe and thanking each for a great night out.

Now I have also called, neither of them have responded and I realise I have probably offended the most lovely woman I have met in a long time.  

I am concerned for the welfare of the woman left walking home at 3am, I feel responsible for her safety and I feel that she wont trust me in the future.  That is obviously bad enough but considering that I really like her and thought we might have a shot at an awesome relationship, I feel even worse and am kicking myself. 

I know what I have done is wrong, but as a man who has alot of trouble understanding the fairfer sex, I wonder if any women out there have advice on how I might restore what could be a wonderful friendship and even more than that ...

Did I blow it? Or am I worried about nothing and maybe should just man up and put it out of my mind ...

EDIT: thanks for your opinions everyone and it has validated that I am feeling really bad about this for a good reason.  So far I have called, left a voicemail and txt'd again and she still has not gotten back to me.  Maybe she has misplaced her phone, run out of credit, etc but more likely she is really pissed off at me and I deserve that.

Edit 2, Yes she's ok.  Simply didn't have her phone with her but got home safe and she is talking to me so it's all good. ",AskWomen,3,1346585301.0,11,https://reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/z85xw/as_a_man_out_last_night_with_a_lovely_woman_i/
"Hi /r/AskWomen! I'm 18 and have never been in a relationship/kissed a girl, any advice? (throwaway)","&gt;Hey /r/AskWomen!

  I apologize for the throwaway but I'm going to get fo'reals in this thread [long story incoming]. Any &amp; all advice is greatly appreciated!

________________________________________________________________________________________

  So here's a little bit of backstory... I'm a guy, I came to the US when I was 4. My parents both grew up in and lived the majority of their lives in a fairly underdeveloped country, which had been under a communist regime for nearly a century. Basically, what this meant for 4-year-old-me is that due to all the propaganda they had heard about America, when we finally moved here, they were very paranoid and concerned for my safety. As a result, my parents wouldn't let me visit or hang out friends unless they knew their families personally (which stops happening at about the age of 5 or 6).

________________________________________________________________________________________

  Fast forward ~10 years, and I'm in high school. Strangely, not being able to hang out with friends outside of school made me truly appreciate the time I had with them during the day. Either way, I had a kick ass time in high school and befriended most of the people I met.

________________________________________________________________________________________

  I know it sounds like I'm blaming my parents, but they're sincere people and they're just stuck in their ways. So I graduate, I'm 18 and quite literally, the most psyched I have EVER been in my entire life was getting ready to move away to college. Throughout my entire school career I would daydream about living on my own without being badgered by my parents. Literally just the thought of living on my own and finding a nice girlfriend would brighten up even the worst of days.


________________________________________________________________________________________

  After many long, heated debates with my parents, we agreed that I would spend the first semester of my freshman year commuting (to sort of ""transition"" into the college life, as my parents were aware of how strict they were) and then I would be allowed to dorm. Ironically, this backfired pretty badly, as it's really hard to meet people as a commuter. So here I am, halfway through the second semester of my freshman year, and so very little has changed.

________________________________________________________________________________________

  Here's where I need your help, Reddit... I've always been a pretty social guy, to gals and guys. However I always felt a sort of barrier when it came to girls, because I knew that realistically, it wasn't going to go anywhere outside of school. So here I am, now that I'm finally able to, I'm halfway through my second semester here and I have yet to kiss a girl, let alone lose my virginity. I don't really care about either of those, I strive to be a humble person, but I'd really just love a girl to call my own, to just hang out with and talk about nothing. If anything I'd much rather have a girlfriend over a fuckbuddy.
